"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency. Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland.","Trump Names Mark Meadows Chief of Staff, Ousting Mick Mulvaney",2020-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/trump-mark-meadows-mick-mulvaney.html,new_york_times
"President Trump claimed again on Friday that anyone who needed a coronavirus test “gets a test.” But from Washington State to Florida to New York, doctors and patients are clamoring for tests that they say are in woefully short supply, and their frustration is mounting alongside the growing number of cases around the country. In California, where thousands are being monitored for the virus, only 516 tests had been conducted by the state as of Thursday. Washington health officials have more cases than they can currently process. And in New York, where cases have quadrupled this week, a New York City official pleaded for more test kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The slow federal action on this matter has impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic,” the official said in a letter Friday. More than 300 cases have been confirmed, at least 17 have died, and thousands are in self-quarantine. Public health officials are warning that no one knows how deeply the virus will spread, in part because the federal government’s flawed rollout of tests three weeks ago has snowballed into an embarrassing fiasco of national proportions.","With Test Kits in Short Supply, Health Officials Sound Alarms",2020-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/testing-coronavirus.html,new_york_times
"Bernie Sanders was several takes into a video delivering a message he desperately needed to convey last fall — that he was healthy enough to soldier on after his heart attack — when his team realized something was not clicking. You have to tell people how you really feel, one aide chimed in, according to a person who worked on the shoot. The heart attack not only deepened your commitment to health reform, the aide said; it was personal. Public introspection is not Mr. Sanders’s go-to move. But he gave it a shot. Near the end of the seven-minute video posted on his Instagram account in October, after swipes at “corporate media” and a pitch for “Medicare for All,” the candidate haltingly admitted that his hospitalization had indeed prompted him to take stock.",The Bernie Sanders Personality Test,2020-03-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/bernie-sanders-image.html,new_york_times
"Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign organization in key Super Tuesday states was so flimsy that it shocked and alarmed Democratic Party leaders. Mr. Biden had little cash for advertising on the airwaves. His message just days before the big vote was sometimes unfocused and meandering. But when 14 states voted on Tuesday, none of that mattered: Mr. Biden swept to victory in 10 of them, reflecting a quickly coalescing moderate wing of the Democratic Party and a desperation among voters to start taking the fight to President Trump. “There’s no analogous situation that I can think of in presidential politics where a candidate who was really on the brink of extinction came back and, over four days, took command of a race without benefit of media or organization,” said David Axelrod, who served as chief strategist for President Barack Obama. “It’s an unparalleled situation.” Mr. Biden was greatly aided by the late endorsements of two former rivals, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who exited the race at the beginning of the week. Mr. Biden’s overwhelming victory in South Carolina last Saturday, powered by African-American voters, injected a stunning dose of momentum into the campaign after losses in the first three nominating contests.",Joe Biden Has Had Flimsy Organization.

"WASHINGTON — After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump administration about the coronavirus, the government’s top health officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt about the dangers of the outbreak. If he approved, they would level with the public. But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan. At noon on Feb. 25, just as Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home, she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States was about to change. “The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said. Schools might have to close, conferences could be canceled, businesses might make employees work from home. She had told her own children, she said, to prepare for “significant disruption to our lives.” The stock market plummeted, cable news blared apocalyptic headlines and by the time Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews early the next morning, his critics were accusing him of sowing confusion on an issue of life or death.","Miscommunication, Confusion and Fear Mar White House Response to CoronavirusThe Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus has repeatedly matched public health experts against a hesitant White House, where worry of panic dominates.By Michael D.

"WASHINGTON — Erik Prince, the security contractor with close ties to the Trump administration, has in recent years helped recruit former American and British spies for secretive intelligence-gathering operations that included infiltrating Democratic congressional campaigns, labor organizations and other groups considered hostile to the Trump agenda, according to interviews and documents. One of the former spies, an ex-MI6 officer named Richard Seddon, helped run a 2017 operation to copy files and record conversations in a Michigan office of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers’ unions in the nation. Mr. Seddon directed an undercover operative to secretly tape the union’s local leaders and try to gather information that could be made public to damage the organization, documents show. Using a different alias the next year, the same undercover operative infiltrated the congressional campaign of Abigail Spanberger, then a former C.I.A. officer who went on to win an important House seat in Virginia as a Democrat. The campaign discovered the operative and fired her. Both operations were run by Project Veritas, a conservative group that has gained attention using hidden cameras and microphones for sting operations on news organizations, Democratic politicians and liberal advocacy groups. Mr. Seddon’s role in the teachers’ union operation — detailed in internal Project Veritas emails that have emerged from the discovery process of a court battle between the group and the union — has not previously been reported, nor has Mr. Prince’s role in recruiting Mr. Seddon for the group’s activities.","Erik Prince Recruits Ex-Spies to Help Infiltrate Liberal GroupsMr. Prince, a contractor close to the Trump administration, contacted veteran spies for operations by Project Veritas, the conservative group known for conducting stings on news organizations and other groups.By Mark Mazzetti and Adam Goldman",2020-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/erik-prince-project-veritas.html,new_york_times
"Lucio Delgado was excited when he went to the post office last month to pick up an envelope from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Enclosed were the results of a citizenship test that Mr. Delgado, a 23-year-old green card holder from Mexico, thought he had aced. He and his sister, who accompanied him, opened the envelope in the post office. The letter inside said he had failed the reading portion of the test and was ineligible for naturalization. Mr. Delgado, who is blind, was crushed. When he took his test in May, the reading section had not been available in Braille. At an appointment with federal agents months later, he explained the problem and thought they were prepared to help him.","With No Braille Option, a Blind Man Failed His Citizenship ExamLucio Delgado said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not deliver the Braille reading test he had requested.

"MADISON, Wis. — Debt has dogged Brian Michelz his entire adult life. It started with an ambulance ride when he was 18 and two hospital stays. Then came college loans. By the time Mr. Michelz made it out into the world, his credit score was so low he could not even get a credit card. He has paid for everything he has ever bought — televisions, furniture, cars — up front. After grocery shopping on Wednesday, his bank account had three dollars in it. Mr. Michelz, 29, has never worn a political T-shirt or been to a campaign rally. But when he voted for the first time in his life, in the primary of 2016, it was for Bernie Sanders. “I wouldn’t say I’m on the left, or a liberal progressive,” Mr. Michelz said in his apartment one morning last week, sitting next to his wife, Sarah Michelz, who had just come home from her work as a nurse. “I feel like Sanders understood — there’s too much medical debt and college debt. I was like, ‘OK, he’s speaking the truth.’” Mr. Sanders has staked his campaign on the promise that he can draw in voters who have felt left out of politics — in particular the young and the working class, especially in regions like the Midwest where Democrats lost to Donald J. Trump in 2016.","A Sanders Voter, Weary of Debt at 29: ‘I Have Nothing to Lose’Brian Michelz has never worn a political T-shirt or been to a campaign rally.

"When Senator Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race on Thursday, it was a devastating blow for her supporters and the 1,000-some staff members she had hired from coast to coast. But within hours, hundreds of alerts began popping up on their phones: emojis of whiskey pours, clinking champagne flutes, sloshing beer mugs, martinis and red wine glasses. Plus, cash. Lots of cash. Welcome to the unseen and surprise Venmo economy of collapsed campaigns in 2020, where political operatives have been, for months, sending drinking money digitally to their friends, former colleagues and rivals using the money-transferring app. “It’s like a Candygram but in 2020,” said Lily Adams, the former communications director for Senator Kamala Harris. “But better and far more useful.” The practice has spread unexpectedly and unplanned from campaign to campaign, like a viral video with a life of its own: $10 here, $25, even $100. It peaked this past week as Ms. Warren followed Tom Steyer, Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar and Michael R. Bloomberg to the exits.",The Hidden Venmo Economy of Campaign Staffers When Their Boss QuitsThe race is over.

"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr testified before Congress last spring that “it’s time for everybody to move on” from the special counsel investigation into whether Trump associates conspired with Russia’s 2016 election interference. Nearly a year later, however, it is clear that Mr. Barr has not moved on from the investigation at all. Rather, he increasingly appears to be chiseling away at it. The attorney general’s handling of the results of the Russia inquiry came under fire when a federal judge questioned this week whether Mr. Barr had sought to create a “one-sided narrative” clearing Mr. Trump of misconduct. The judge said Mr. Barr displayed a “lack of candor” in remarks that helped shape the public view of the special counsel’s report before it was released in April. In fact, Mr. Barr’s comments then were but the first in a series of actions in which he cast doubt not just on the findings of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and some of the resulting prosecutions, but on its very premise. In the process, Mr. Barr demoralized some of the department’s rank and file and lent credence to Republican politicians who seek to elevate the Mueller investigation into an election-year political issue — including Mr. Trump.",News AnalysisBarr Increasingly Appears Focused on Undermining Mueller InquiryA judge’s criticism cast light on the first in a series of steps by the attorney general to take aim at the Russia investigation.By Sharon LaFraniere,2020-03-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/barr-mueller-investigation.html,new_york_times
"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence has long been a one-man political cleanup crew for President Trump. From his day trip last fall to Turkey to negotiate a cease-fire in northern Syria to his takeover of the chaotic presidential transition, Mr. Pence is used to being diverted from his reliably anodyne schedule. Now he has moved into one of the biggest political janitor jobs of all time. Mr. Trump, who in recent weeks was infuriated by early decisions to allow coronavirus patients into the United States and irritated by public health officials offering their assessments to the public, has turned to Mr. Pence, an unfailing loyalist, to tamp down on messaging efforts and wrangle competing offices within the White House. “Having the vice president gives me the biggest stick one could have in the government on this whole-of-government approach,” Mr. Trump proclaimed last week when he appointed Mr. Pence to lead the administration’s coronavirus task force. He did not mention that one of Mr. Pence’s jobs is to clean up after a font of misinformation, the president himself, who has said he has a “hunch” that the virus is not as lethal as experts say and that everything will be better by April.","Pence, a Loyalist Tapped for Coronavirus Effort, Adds to Trump’s Mixed MessagesIn wresting control of the administration’s haphazard response to the virus, Mike Pence has taken on a familiar role as the president’s political janitor.By Katie Rogers",2020-03-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/pence-trump-coronavirus.html,new_york_times
"The news that Senator Elizabeth Warren was exiting the Democratic presidential primary led to an outpouring of reactions across the country. Many of her supporters described how meaningful it had been to see her rise to the top of the presidential field, and praised the policies she had brought to the table. Others said they were disillusioned to see that the narrative that women are less electable than men persists and the glass ceiling above the White House remains intact. Some wondered about what she would do next. Tributes for Ms. Warren blanketed social media, with people using the hashtag #ThankYouElizabeth to express their gratitude. Others honored her in a more tangible way, writing messages on Post-it notes and surrounding her portrait in a hallway at Harvard Law School. Our readers left thousands of comments on our website about Ms. Warren’s importance to them and what they would like to see from her going forward.

"DETROIT — Calibrating his approach for a tough head-to-head primary matchup in a year when many Democratic voters want to put up a united front, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Friday renewed his attacks on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s record on trade while also conceding that Mr. Biden could defeat President Trump. In Michigan, where the Sanders campaign is running a TV ad featuring an autoworker who says his community has been “decimated” by free trade deals, Mr. Sanders attacked Mr. Biden for his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s. “Joe Biden and I have a very serious disagreement with regards to NAFTA,” Mr. Sanders said at a round table he convened of workers, union leaders and economists in Detroit before a rally attended by thousands. “Just last year — I’m not talking about 20 years ago — Joe said that voting for NAFTA, quote, was not a mistake, end of quote, and a few years before that he called NAFTA a success,” Mr. Sanders said. “Joe, you’re wrong. NAFTA was not a success. Voting for it was a big, big mistake.” As a long line of mostly young supporters filed into a downtown convention center, organizers called out for any union members to identify themselves. After major disappointments on Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders is hoping for a comeback next Tuesday as six states go to the polls, none more crucial for him than Michigan, the first of several Midwestern industrial states to vote in the next two weeks. Four years ago, he pulled off one of the biggest surprises of his first presidential campaign when he upset Hillary Clinton in Michigan.","Sanders Continues Attacks on Trade but Concedes Biden Could Beat Trump“As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that,” Mr. Sanders said.By Trip Gabriel and Matt Stevens",2020-03-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-primary.html,new_york_times

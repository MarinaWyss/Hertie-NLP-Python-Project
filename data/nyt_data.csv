"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland. Mr. Trump’s decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day. Mr. Trump’s decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day. In taking over the White House, Mr. Meadows, 60, a retiring Republican from North Carolina, becomes Mr. Trump’s fourth chief of staff in 38 months, the most that any president has had in such a short time. His arrival almost surely signals more changes to follow, as most of Mr. Mulvaney’s deputies and others on his team are expected to leave, too, possibly including Emma Doyle, his top lieutenant, and Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser.

Hope Hicks, one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted advisers, returns on Monday in a new role working for Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Mulvaney, who technically retained his post as budget director while serving as acting chief of staff, will surrender that, too, and the acting director, Russell T. Vought, appears poised to take the job permanently, an appointment he has quietly lobbied for for months.The change has been a long time coming. The president soured on Mr. Mulvaney a while ago but was warned by advisers not to get rid of him until after his Senate trial, which ended with Mr. Trump’s acquittal on Feb. 6. Throughout the impeachment battle, Mr. Mulvaney was at near-open war with the White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone, at one point seen as a potential successor as chief of staff.Mr. Mulvaney had increasingly been on the losing side of policy battles and appeared less often at Mr. Trump’s side. Some saw a sign of impending dismissal last month at the wedding of Stephen Miller, the president’s senior adviser, and Katie Waldman, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump sat with Mr. Meadows and his wife along with other advisers at one table, while Mr. Mulvaney was left at a lower-tier table, according to a witness. Wedding guests whispered about the optics of the scene, right in front of so many people.

Mr. Trump called Mr. Meadows on Thursday to offer him the job, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Mr. Mulvaney, who took an annual trip to Nevada this week, learned of the decision on Friday, another person familiar with the events said. Mr. Mulvaney did not travel with Mr. Trump to Florida; instead, he sent Ms. Doyle.The president wanted to announce the news on Twitter earlier in the day, but ended up waiting until after a day of travel to Tennessee to survey tornado damage and to Georgia to tour the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to another person close to the situation. Some aides assumed he would therefore wait until Sunday and were taken off-guard at the Friday night tweet.The replacement was widely seen in the West Wing as a chance for the president to reinvigorate his staff, over which Mr. Mulvaney was seen as losing control. Some of the president’s conservative advisers, including Fox News hosts, had been pressing him to replace Mr. Mulvaney.In Mr. Meadows, Mr. Trump will have an ally he considers a confidant and bellwether of congressional conservatives. “I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At a closed-door fund-raiser on Friday evening, he told donors that Mr. Meadows would be “my James Baker,” according to a person in the room, referring to the chief of staff to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Baker is generally considered the gold standard in the post.In a statement of his own, Mr. Meadows praised Mr. Mulvaney for doing “a great job,” adding, “This president and his administration have a long list of incredible victories they’ve delivered to the country during this first term, with the best yet to come.”A founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Meadows has been one of the president’s most ardent defenders. For months during the impeachment battle, Mr. Meadows was a ubiquitous face on television arguing forcefully that the president had done nothing wrong, appearances that cemented his relationship with Mr. Trump.First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows announced in December that he did not plan to seek re-election, hinting at the time that he might work for Mr. Trump in some capacity. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said.

Mr. Mulvaney, 52, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, served as chief of staff for more than 14 months in an “acting” capacity without ever formally being given the title. Mr. Mulvaney brushed off the snub by telling people that everyone in Mr. Trump’s White House was effectively in the job on an acting basis, but the seeming lack of faith or respect invariably made it harder for him to impose authority.Witnesses placed Mr. Mulvaney at the heart of the events that led to Mr. Trump’s impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to incriminate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney carried out Mr. Trump’s order to suspend $391 million in aid to Ukraine, an action declared illegal by the Government Accountability Office. Some advisers later told the president that Mr. Mulvaney had helped ensnare him in impeachment, even though he was following Mr. Trump’s wishes.At a news briefing in October, Mr. Mulvaney contradicted the president’s denial that he had imposed a quid pro quo on the assistance to benefit his own political fortunes. Mr. Mulvaney told reporters that the White House had withheld aid to Ukraine in part to force Kyiv to commit to investigating a widely debunked theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of the Democrats, a story that American intelligence agencies have called Russian disinformation.“Absolutely. No question about that,” Mr. Mulvaney said. He added, “That’s why we held up the money. ”Later that afternoon, Mr. Mulvaney issued a written statement trying to take it back, denying any quid pro quo between the aid and the investigation.The conflicting statements bolstered Democratic critics and dismayed Republican defenders, who were relying on his assurances that the aid suspension was not tied to his demands that Ukraine investigate Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney defied a House subpoena to testify, but House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump in the Senate played his comments from the briefing repeatedly as part of their case.Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, told House investigators last fall that Mr. Mulvaney had been involved in arranging a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that was tied to whether he would conduct the investigations sought by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. She testified that Mr. Mulvaney was working with Gordon D. Sondland, who was then the ambassador to the European Union.

Bolton, then the president’s national security adviser, was alarmed at the machinations and ordered Ms. Hill to report the matter to a White House lawyer. “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” Mr. Bolton told her to tell the lawyer.Unlike his predecessor John F. Kelly, a retired Marine general who left in late 2018, Mr. Mulvaney made a point of not trying to control the famously mercurial president and instead let Trump be Trump. Mr. Kelly said in October, as the House was pursuing its Ukraine inquiry, that he had previously warned the president that such an approach would mean that “you will be impeached.”As Mr. Trump’s first budget director, Mr. Mulvaney helped enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, the president’s signature legislative victory, and rolled back environmental and other regulations. But he was frustrated in his attempts to pare back spending and wound up presiding over a period of rocketing budget deficits that are projected to top $1 trillion a year for the next decade.During Mr. Mulvaney’s time as acting chief of staff, the economy remained strong, and by the end of his tenure, Mr. Trump’s approval rating had risen to 49 percent in Gallup’s poll, the highest of his presidency. He made a point of using Camp David to build ties with lawmakers and aides who otherwise previously felt neglected.Mr. Mulvaney recently told an audience in Britain that he regularly conflicted with the president over various decisions but made a point of keeping that private. “I disagree with the president every single day,” he said. “You just don’t hear about it — that’s not my job.”Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman from New York, and Annie Karni, Katie Rogers, Michael D.

"President Trump claimed again on Friday that anyone who needed a coronavirus test “gets a test.” But from Washington State to Florida to New York, doctors and patients are clamoring for tests that they say are in woefully short supply, and their frustration is mounting alongside the growing number of cases around the country.In California, where thousands are being monitored for the virus, only 516 tests had been conducted by the state as of Thursday. Washington health officials have more cases than they can currently process. And in New York, where cases have quadrupled this week, a New York City official pleaded for more test kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The slow federal action on this matter has impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic,” the official said in a letter Friday.More than 300 cases have been confirmed, at least 17 have died, and thousands are in self-quarantine. Public health officials are warning that no one knows how deeply the virus will spread, in part because the federal government’s flawed rollout of tests three weeks ago has snowballed into an embarrassing fiasco of national proportions.

Public health officials are warning that no one knows how deeply the virus will spread, in part because the federal government’s flawed rollout of tests three weeks ago has snowballed into an embarrassing fiasco of national proportions. The latest two deaths were announced late Friday night in Florida, marking the first time fatal cases were not on the West Coast.In the last week, Mr. Trump and his top officials repeatedly promised that 1 million to 1.5 million tests would be sent around the country, even though labs — government and private ones alike — have struggled to get the tests running amid a growing number of infections and rising demand for tests. Despite an order Wednesday by the C.D.C. to greatly expand criteria for who can be tested, many hospitals and state health authorities continued to limit tests to those at the highest risk for infection, adding to the confusion and frustration, especially in hot spots like California and Washington.In California, Cindy Homen, 58, followed the advice she had heard from public health officials this week and emailed her primary care doctor about getting tested, at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Santa Rosa, Calif., when she started to come down with coughing fits and a sore throat.She received a reply Thursday telling her she did not need to get tested, that most people exposed to the virus recover after experiencing mild symptoms. She was advised to wash her hands and stay home. “At this point, testing is very limited,” her doctor wrote.“This whole thing is just a big joke,” Ms. Homen said. “How do they track the coronavirus if there aren’t enough test kits and they don’t even want you to come in?” The latest two deaths were announced late Friday night in Florida, marking the first time fatal cases were not on the West Coast.In the last week, Mr. Trump and his top officials repeatedly promised that 1 million to 1.5 million tests would be sent around the country, even though labs — government and private ones alike — have struggled to get the tests running amid a growing number of infections and rising demand for tests.

On Friday, Mr. Pence said it would be a “matter of weeks” before Americans could get easy access to a coronavirus test.And on Thursday, he seemed to acknowledge that the administration’s estimates were high. Speaking at a 3M plant in Minnesota where another item in short supply — respirator masks — are made, he said, “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.” Mr. Pence added: “For those who we believe have been exposed, for those who are showing symptoms, we’ve been able to provide the testing.”On Friday, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, was prompted to speak by the president at the White House signing of the $8.3 billion emergency spending bill for the coronavirus. Mr. Azar told reporters: “I just want to make it clear that in terms of tests, we have provided all the tests to the state of Washington and the state of California that they’ve asked for. The production and shipping of tests that we’ve talked about all week is completely on schedule.” Over the past few days, Vice President Mike Pence has been moderating expectations about how quickly the tests would be widely available.

In addition, he said, Integrated DNA Technologies, the private contractor working with the C.D.C. to ship to the private sector and hospitals, has already distributed enough materials for 700,000 tests.
At a short news conference during the president’s visit to the C.D.C. lab in Atlanta on Friday, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., said the agency had never denied a request by local public health officials. “All of our state labs now have the ability to test for this virus,” he said.Mr. Trump interjected at one point, as administration officials explained the timetable for rolling out tests to the states. “Anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test,” the president said. “They’re there. They have the tests and the tests are beautiful.” But states and public health experts are warning that access is still limited and varies from state to state, hampering the ability to know how far the virus has spread or for how long it has gone undetected in some regions of the country.“We’re going to need millions and millions and millions of tests,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a CNN town hall Thursday.

After weeks of delays by the C.D.C. because of a “manufacturing problem"" in one component of its test, and the Food and Drug Administration’s refusal to lift testing restrictions for large academic centers or private companies until Feb. 29, many laboratories have begun to process tests only in the last few days. There still is no central reporting system to track the number of tests conducted or the number of patients who have been tested.[Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic here.]It is nearly impossible to know precisely how many people in the United States have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. reported Thursday that it had tested 1,583 patients since the beginning of the outbreak, but it is not making public how many tests are being done at state and local public health laboratories, despite publishing similar data on the seasonal flu. Many local labs are just beginning to receive long-delayed test kits and, even at full capacity, will be able to run only about 100 tests per day.A total of 71 public laboratories in 47 states and the District of Columbia had the capacity to test for the coronavirus as of Friday afternoon, according to the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents government laboratories around the country. That’s up from just eight labs able to process tests last Thursday.“We’ve seen major progress with essentially the lights coming on across the country,” said Scott Becker, the association’s chief executive.

But the delays mean that “we’re absolutely a few weeks behind where we should be,” he said, adding, “There is no way you can sugarcoat that.”Maine said it was still bringing its state laboratory online. Pennsylvania officials said they would have the capacity to test 150 specimens a day at the state laboratory beginning this weekend. Arkansas can process eight to 10 tests daily, and has so far tested six patients.Large, private laboratories are also ramping up. LabCorp, a major diagnostics company, began offering a coronavirus test Thursday evening. Another firm, Quest Diagnostics, said it would launch a similar product on Monday.“The reason that’s important, the reason that meets future demand is because the enormous capacity of these commercial laboratories and others in the country are precisely how we will make coronavirus tests available for your local doctor, available to your pharmacy and broadly available to the American public,” Mr. Pence said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing Friday.But Wendy Bost, a Quest spokeswoman, sounded a more cautious tone. “While we believe we have capacity to accommodate initial demand, this is an evolving situation and we anticipate building additional capacity over time,” she said in a statement.

Dr. Alex Greninger, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak, said the university’s lab had tested about 400 patients since it set up operations earlier this week under new federal guidelines. The lab can yield results in about eight hours and is testing patients from several hospitals around Washington State. “I’m entirely focused on testing and building out operations that can handle thousands of tests a day,” he said.

Meanwhile, the state laboratories in Washington have more cases than they can currently process.“We have a small backlog that we hope to be through very soon,” said Danielle Koenig, a spokeswoman for that state’s health department. The agency had tested 91 patients as of Wednesday, and attributed the backlog to both a lack of staffing and physical capacity. Their facilities can currently handle 200 samples per day, with each patient requiring between one and three tests.In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis cautioned that the state had not yet received enough testing kits. “I know they have tens of thousands that will eventually be en route,” he said. “We’d like to get them, obviously, as soon as possible.”So far, the state is conducting tests at three public health labs in Miami, Tampa and Jacksonville.The C.D.C.’s decision to remove most criteria for testing took some state officials and large health systems off-guard.“Everyone under the sun who is going to develop a cough is going to want to get a test for coronavirus,” Dr. Mark Levine, the commissioner of Vermont’s health department, said on the day the changes were announced. On Friday, Vermont health officials said they had run eight tests in the state. Many states reported on Friday that they had run only a handful of tests.In several states, health officials have been sending out guidance to physicians encouraging them to first test for other likely causes, such as the flu, before sending samples to state laboratories.

Ron DeSantis cautioned that the state had not yet received enough testing kits. “I know they have tens of thousands that will eventually be en route,” he said. “We’d like to get them, obviously, as soon as possible.”So far, the state is conducting tests at three public health labs in Miami, Tampa and Jacksonville.The C.D.C.’s decision to remove most criteria for testing took some state officials and large health systems off-guard.“Everyone under the sun who is going to develop a cough is going to want to get a test for coronavirus,” Dr. Mark Levine, the commissioner of Vermont’s health department, said on the day the changes were announced. On Friday, Vermont health officials said they had run eight tests in the state. Many states reported on Friday that they had run only a handful of tests.In several states, health officials have been sending out guidance to physicians encouraging them to first test for other likely causes, such as the flu, before sending samples to state laboratories. “We realize people are scared — we recognize that,” said Dr. Dean Sidelinger, the state epidemiologist in Oregon, but he added that it was important to prioritize people at the highest risk. “We realize people are scared — we recognize that,” said Dr. Dean Sidelinger, the state epidemiologist in Oregon, but he added that it was important to prioritize people at the highest risk. Mr. Becker, of the public health lab association, said he worried that mixed messages from the Trump administration could create demand for testing that “has the potential to overwhelm the public health system, and the country.”In Colorado, Scott Bookman, the incident commander overseeing the coronavirus for the state’s health department, warned: “We don’t have unlimited supply going forward, so we want to be careful with that.”Mr. Bookman said Colorado had tested samples from 100 patients, and its lab could test samples for 160 patients per day, if needed. State health officials announced Colorado’s first two infections on Thursday, with additional cases on Friday.Utah, where one patient has been treated for coronavirus, can test about 30 people daily. That’s enough to keep up with current demand but there are potential bottlenecks: Parts of the test are conducted manually, and supplies that come from outside vendors may become scarce.“We’re not turning away tests, but our capacity right now is limited by the fact that we have a human being extracting the DNA,” said Jenny Johnson, a Utah spokeswoman.

Doctors and lab officials alike say that the lack of clear communication from the government was hampering rather than helping their efforts.

Dr. John Strayer, an emergency doctor at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, Wash., where some of the patients infected with the virus had been admitted, said the loosened criteria have “added to my work.”He said he now has to triage patients based on whether they were sick enough to need a test urgently. Most people are sent back home and told to quarantine until they get better.Dr. Strayer said the new policy had certainly created “lots of very angry patients.”Kate Mannle, 37, of Seattle spent a week trying to get tested. Ms. Mannle returned Saturday from an overseas trip that included a layover in South Korea, which is experiencing an outbreak of the new virus. On Sunday, she developed a fever and a cough, but was told by her doctor and hospitals that she was not sick enough to get tested.Ms. Mannle, the director of training programs for a conservation nonprofit, quarantined herself inside her one-bedroom apartment in Seattle, where she spent the week sleeping, doing a little yoga and trying to recover from her 101-degree fever and respiratory infection. She plans to stay inside until 24 to 48 hours after her cough goes away. She suspects she did indeed contract the virus, but she will probably never know for sure.“They’ve put up so many barriers,” she said. “I’m tired of it and I’m ready to move on.” She added: “But what about the next one?

"Bernie Sanders was several takes into a video delivering a message he desperately needed to convey last fall — that he was healthy enough to soldier on after his heart attack — when his team realized something was not clicking.You have to tell people how you really feel, one aide chimed in, according to a person who worked on the shoot. The heart attack not only deepened your commitment to health reform, the aide said; it was personal.Public introspection is not Mr. Sanders’s go-to move. But he gave it a shot. Near the end of the seven-minute video posted on his Instagram account in October, after swipes at “corporate media” and a pitch for “Medicare for All,” the candidate haltingly admitted that his hospitalization had indeed prompted him to take stock.

But is there a deeper layer, a “real” Bernie the public does not get to see?People who have known Mr. Sanders for years say that, if anything, he is more intense and can be insensitive to people who encounter his moods — in other words, even more Bernie than Bernie. Being around Mr. Sanders, they say, is to watch him endlessly wind himself up and back down, long periods of tension punctuated by brief, welcome intervals of calm.Within hours of having two cardiac stents installed after his heart attack, the senator was back on the phone with senior aides in Washington, grilling them on proposed staff hires, dictating media strategy and asking for details of an advertising buy, aides said.That intensity can sometimes cross the line.

In the run-up to the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Tad Devine, then a senior campaign adviser, pressured Mr. Sanders to commission a survey gauging his strengths and weaknesses. The candidate reluctantly agreed.A few days later, Mr. Sanders exploded at Mr. Devine when a journalist obtained a leaked recording of the questions. “What did you do? You are trying to destroy my reputation and my image!” Mr. Sanders shouted at the adviser, bursting through the closed door of his office in Des Moines, according to a witness.Even his amusements seem to be in character. He uses an iPad (not a phone) to devour social media and news, and loves to watch old boxing matches and movies like “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Melancholia,” a 2011 dystopian drama that ends with the obliteration of the Earth. He sings along, tunelessly, with 1960s and 1970s folk rock on car radios, takes long walks with his wife and adores his grandchildren.

Mostly, he works.“He is always working and looking to move the ball forward, even when he is having a casual conversation,” said Michaeleen Crowell, the former chief of staff in his Senate office. “It’s hard for him to take time off for himself. He’s happiest when he’s working.”A ‘Lone Ranger’ Finds AlliesIn January, Hillary Clinton, who believes Mr. Sanders’s refusal to quickly exit the 2016 primaries damaged her cause, made news with her comment that “nobody likes” Mr. Sanders in the Senate — ushering in a debate over whether he was simply too abrasive to get elected.The claim was not entirely baseless. Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, was deeply unpopular for many of his 16 years in the House of Representatives, where he bucked his own leadership and pelted bills with amendments, many of the gadfly variety.“He was like a lone ranger,” Representative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat who is one of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s closest allies, said in an interview last summer. She called his record “thin.”But the Senate has a higher threshold for grandstanding and eccentricity, so Mr. Sanders, who forged an alliance with the former majority leader Harry Reid, found a more forgiving crowd. He is less disliked than seen as a loner prone to delivering irritating sermons, fellow senators said.“No, people don’t hate Bernie,” said a Democratic senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I’d say the feeling is closer to resentment, because some of us have to take the tough votes on things so he can keep his brand pure.”As a boss, Mr. Sanders is notoriously tough. Former aides have described him as demanding and particular, sometimes to a fault.

Mr. Sanders “never makes you feel like you’re good enough to be in the room with him,” one former aide said. When an appearance at a rally in New Hampshire last fall was delayed, an impatient Mr. Sanders brushed past an organizer and barked: “I’m the candidate, not you. I’m going on,” according to a person backstage.More serious outbursts are rare, and Mr. Sanders doesn’t tend to take pushback personally, several former aides said. Mr. Devine, who declined to comment, gave back as good as he got in the exchange, according to a person who was in the room.Mr. Sanders denies that he has ever been an abusive boss, but allows that he can be difficult to work with, and has attributed his impatience to his own sense that he is falling short of his own high expectations.“Look, I don’t tolerate [expletive] terribly well,” he told the New York Times editorial board in December. “I’m not good at backslapping. I’m not good at pleasantries. If you have your birthday, I’m not going to call you up to congratulate you, so you’ll love me and you’ll write nice things about me.”He has virtually no tolerance for small talk. Steve Slavin, a high school friend of his and later his college roommate, recalled the day in 2008 when Mr. Sanders invited him to speak at his enshrinement on James Madison High School’s Wall of Distinction.

As they waited, Mr. Sanders did not say a word to him and instead spent the time writing notes on a piece of paper, silently.“He was scribbling away what he was going to say,” Mr. Slavin said in an interview. “We didn’t talk at all.”Creature ComfortsThough he can be difficult, with a stubborn streak that can exasperate, close friends and allies have learned to adjust. Perhaps that is why his innermost circle is so small, made up of his wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders; Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager; Warren Gunnels, his Senate policy director; and a pair of Burlington buddies, Huck Gutman and Richard Sugarman.Mr. Weaver said in early 2019 that he would not oversee Mr. Sanders’s 2020 run, after several staff members on the 2016 campaign came forward with claims that incidents of sexism and harassment were not appropriately addressed. But Mr. Sanders never had any intention of sidelining his close friend, and Mr. Weaver remains as influential as ever, according to campaign aides.The candidate’s need to control his surroundings also extends to the physical environment. He hates the cramped hassle of flying commercial, aides say, even if going private doesn’t entirely comport with his brand.For years, Mr. Sanders’s staff members have compiled hotel dos and don’ts for a man who rises early but sometimes finds it hard to fall asleep. The list, distributed to aides in his entourage and shared with hotel employees, stipulates that his room must be kept at an arctic 60 degrees. That he needs an oscillating fan. Other wish lists have requested that written materials be removed. That the room must be at least five doors away from the ice machine and from the elevator, though the walk to the elevator must not be too long.

That was just a starting point, according to aides who went along on Mr. Sanders’s weeklong tour with the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, in 2017. The morning before he was to arrive a hotel in Las Vegas, his staff summoned the hotel engineer to jury-rig the air-conditioner to the required temperature.There was one more problem: Someone had to stay in the room to keep a motion sensor from kicking the thermostat back to 72 degrees. A representative of the Sanders team looked hopefully at a Perez aide, who declined to volunteer. (A Sanders spokesman did not deny the episode, but was skeptical anyone would be asked to do such a thing.)Friends emphasize that Mr. Sanders does not demand star treatment (he routinely rejects upgrades from singles to suites, aides said). It is just that he craves peace and solitude, often to collect his thoughts and catalog them on his ever-present yellow legal pad.The heart attack limited another form of relaxation: eating. Mr. Sanders has been trying to shift to berries, grains and smoothies, but he leans toward heartier stuff — spare ribs, steaks, cheesecake, fried chicken, fried rice, bacon and eggs. He proposed to his wife outside a Burlington Friendly’s after polishing off a hot fudge sundae.Unwinding is not easy for Mr. Sanders under any circumstances, but he seems most likely to let his guard down around children. As he awaited the results of the New Hampshire primary, he wandered the halls of an airport hotel in Manchester with his grandchildren, a person on his staff said, introducing them to campaign aides and giving them a guided tour of vending machines and conference rooms.Randy Bryce, a Sanders campaign surrogate from Wisconsin, remembered going on a campaign swing with Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire last year. He had brought his 13-year-old son, and the three of them, along with Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, grabbed lunch at a coffee shop.At one point, Mr. Bryce got up; when he returned to the table, he saw Mr. Sanders smuggling chips to his son. “Don’t tell your dad I’m giving you all my chips,” Mr. Sanders said loud enough for Mr. Bryce to hear.

He grew up with his brother, Larry, in a household chronically short of money, riven by fighting between his father, Eli, a paint salesman, and his mother, Dorothy, who died when he was 18.Those experiences are never far from his mind, friends say.

But once he got upstairs, he could not persuade the tenant to let him in.Mr. Sanders would not be stopped.

"Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign organization in key Super Tuesday states was so flimsy that it shocked and alarmed Democratic Party leaders. Mr. Biden had little cash for advertising on the airwaves. His message just days before the big vote was sometimes unfocused and meandering.But when 14 states voted on Tuesday, none of that mattered: Mr. Biden swept to victory in 10 of them, reflecting a quickly coalescing moderate wing of the Democratic Party and a desperation among voters to start taking the fight to President Trump.“There’s no analogous situation that I can think of in presidential politics where a candidate who was really on the brink of extinction came back and, over four days, took command of a race without benefit of media or organization,” said David Axelrod, who served as chief strategist for President Barack Obama. “It’s an unparalleled situation.”Mr. Biden was greatly aided by the late endorsements of two former rivals, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who exited the race at the beginning of the week. Mr. Biden’s overwhelming victory in South Carolina last Saturday, powered by African-American voters, injected a stunning dose of momentum into the campaign after losses in the first three nominating contests.

Mr. Biden’s overwhelming victory in South Carolina last Saturday, powered by African-American voters, injected a stunning dose of momentum into the campaign after losses in the first three nominating contests. But Tuesday’s results also showed that in a matchup that was largely against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the less quantifiable elements of Mr. Biden’s campaign — his association with Mr. Obama, his empathy and his more moderate approach to governing — outweighed his lack of organizational heft in many places.Those operational challenges have not evaporated. Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had “virtually no operation” in his state, which votes on Tuesday.Yet as the presidential contest moves into a battle for large, delegate-rich states like Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Florida, Mr. Biden is racing to cement his advantage with the sprawling coalition that propelled him in the past week — this time with the momentum, money and avalanche of endorsements that had eluded him throughout the race, even as his team scrambles to scale up.Headed into the next round of contests on Tuesday, when six states including Michigan and Missouri will vote, Mr. Biden is again seeking to run up the score in heavily African-American congressional districts, build on his newfound strength with moderate suburbanites and fight Mr. Sanders for white working-class voters. He is quickly rerouting some staff to key states, uncorking new ad spending and leaning into sharper criticisms of Mr. Sanders, now his chief rival for the nomination.Mr. Biden’s financial fortunes are rapidly changing: Since last Saturday, the day of his resounding victory in South Carolina, his campaign has raised more than $22 million in online donations — more than double its total fund-raising in the entire month of January. A fund-raiser he attended in Los Angeles on Wednesday was moved outdoors to accommodate the number of people who wanted to come (the guest list included the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother).

Mr. Biden’s surrogates have sprung into action, seeking to help him acquire additional support in upcoming key states through methods both traditional — Ms. Klobuchar deployed to Michigan for Mr. Biden — and creative: The former U.S. ambassador to Ireland was listed as hosting an organizing event recently for Mr. Biden in the small city of Bolivar, Mo.According to his campaign, Mr. Biden has more than 70 endorsements in Missouri, more than 50 in Florida and around 20 in Michigan. Among his newest endorsers in Michigan is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was named a national co-chair of his campaign.Former Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had focused resources on South Carolina out of necessity. But with an eye on the March 17 contest in his own state, Mr. Nelson said, “Now I think you will see a flood of people that will be coming in and augmenting the existing staff in Florida.”“People like a winner,” added Mr. Nelson, who has been pounding the phones, seeking to get more state legislators on board.Still, there is limited time to build out the kind of on-the-ground infrastructure that can often make a difference in close races.In Michigan, Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, another Biden supporter, said the Biden campaign was relying on volunteers, and had long made clear that it did not intend to establish a large presence of paid staff in the state.“They flat-out said we’re not putting field resources in Michigan,” he said, noting that he agreed with their approach. “I told them we’d do the organizing with the volunteers here and we’d be ready to go on March 10, and I think we will be.” Mr. Biden’s surrogates have sprung into action, seeking to help him acquire additional support in upcoming key states through methods both traditional — Ms. Klobuchar deployed to Michigan for Mr. Biden — and creative: The former U.S. ambassador to Ireland was listed as hosting an organizing event recently for Mr. Biden in the small city of Bolivar, Mo.According to his campaign, Mr. Biden has more than 70 endorsements in Missouri, more than 50 in Florida and around 20 in Michigan.

In contrast to 2016, Washington and Idaho Democrats have now embraced primaries — not caucuses, which tend to draw only the most committed activists — a move that some Biden allies hope will allow him to cut into Mr. Sanders’s potential advantages in those states, both of which he won handily in the previous presidential race.On Thursday, Mr. Sanders canceled a rally in Mississippi, a state with a heavily African-American Democratic electorate, redeploying instead to delegate-heavy Michigan, where he and Mr. Biden look poised for a fierce fight over the blue-collar workers that helped Mr. Sanders narrowly win the state in his 2016 presidential bid.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have criticized each other during the primary race — over Mr. Biden’s vote to authorize the war in Iraq, for example, or Mr. Sanders’s record on gun control — but they now both appear willing to wage their most pointed fights to date. Mr. Sanders has released ads jabbing Mr. Biden over his position on trade and his past support at times for Social Security freezes — reviving a fight the two men had in Iowa that Mr. Sanders’s allies believe played to his advantage.Mr. Sanders also released an ad highlighting his ties to Mr. Obama, a move that drew incredulity from some of Mr. Biden’s supporters who note not only Mr. Biden’s service as vice president under Mr. Obama, but also that Mr. Sanders reportedly weighed a primary challenge to Mr. Obama in the 2012 election.

The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state.

As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.

While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said former Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.” While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election.

And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals.

And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals. It is clear why Mr. Sanders is scrambling — the Super Tuesday results carried ominous signs for his candidacy. In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.

Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest. In suburban Oakland County, for example, Mrs. Clinton won by about five points in 2016. But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Saturday continued sending contradictory signals about its response to the coronavirus, as a top federal health official appeared to walk back President Trump’s claim that “anyone who wants a test can get a test.”The health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, cautioned that only those who have gone through a doctor or medical professional can be approved for a test, a message that appeared to undercut Mr. Trump, who delivered his promise on Friday as he toured the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test,” Mr. Azar said at an off-camera briefing at the White House. “That is our medical system in the United States, in the same way that you may not get a cardiac medicine if your doctor doesn’t prescribe that.”Mr. Azar’s comments were another instance of key officials in recent days correcting or clarifying Mr. Trump, who has sought to project calm and preparedness as the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States. More than 100 new cases were announced in the United States on Saturday, including two deaths in Washington State and dozens of new cases in New York State.

More than 100 new cases were announced in the United States on Saturday, including two deaths in Washington State and dozens of new cases in New York State. The communications clash between the president and top officials overseeing the federal government’s response to the coronavirus could obscure valuable knowledge about it, said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the author of “The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide: Leadership and Management in Trying Times.”“Things change in a crisis — the advice may change in a crisis,” said Dr. Sharfstein, a former top F.D.A. official who teaches a class on the topic at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And so it’s really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice.”Mr. Azar on Saturday defended Mr. Trump’s phrasing, saying it reflected a recent shift by federal health agencies, which have loosened testing regulations. The C.D.C on Wednesday lifted all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus.
“What the president said yesterday at the C.D.C., that is consistent with what the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. are saying, which is we as regulators, or as those shipping the test, are not restricting who can get tested,” Mr. Azar said. “We are leaving that to the professional judgment of doctors and public health officials.”Mr. Trump used “shorthand” to make that point, Mr. Azar said.“What he meant to say is we’re not in the way of that,” Mr. Azar said. “And he knows the numbers. We brief him daily.” Mr. Azar’s assertion echoed one made by Vice President Mike Pence at a White House news conference Friday evening, in which the vice president said that doctors treating potentially symptomatic Americans could contact local officials and have state labs do the testing.During a visit to the mask producer 3M in Minnesota on Thursday, Mr. Pence acknowledged the constraints of testing. “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,” he said.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has remained publicly upbeat, minimizing the potential consequences of the virus, which he has said could disappear this spring in warmer weather. “A vast majority are going to be fine,” the president said on Friday about Americans who have the virus, portraying it as similar to the flu.“I’m not concerned at all,” the president said on Saturday when asked about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House.In private, White House officials have cast Mr. Azar as “alarmist.”On Friday, Mr. Trump characterized the government’s testing aptitude as “amazing” and called the C.D.C.’s test “perfect,” statements that have been roundly disputed by scientists and health officials who have expressed alarm over the speed with which the C.D.C. has tested and over the quality of its tests.Consistent messaging, Dr. Sharfstein said, helps with the “fear of the unknown.”“Testing is a more confusing topic than it can seem,” he said. “People can be overly reassured by a negative test or overly panicked by a positive test. Having a thoughtful approach to testing is important.”The number of people who can be tested for the coronavirus and the number of tests available are fluid, federal officials said on Saturday at the White House briefing.

Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, said that 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private health labs as of Friday evening, and hundreds of thousands more were being surveyed for quality at the C.D.C. on Saturday. He said that between public health labs and C.D.C. tests, the total number of samples that have been tested was over 5,860.

Pressed over whether an ill person who consults a doctor and is recommended for a test can get one in a timely way, Mr. Azar said on Saturday that “there’s no reason that should not happen.”Doctors and patients across the nation have painted a much different picture of availability, clamoring for tests they believe are in short supply. In California, only 516 tests had been conducted as of Thursday. Health officials in Washington State have more cases than they can currently process. In New York City, officials have pleaded for more test kits from the C.D.C.State officials facing a growing number of cases criticized the Trump administration this weekend for what they described as its contradictions. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that he was “battling” mixed messages from the federal government.“You have the president saying anybody who wants a test can have a test, it’s beautiful,” he said on MSNBC. “You have the vice president saying we can’t do the tests. We don’t have the capacity.”“That confusion, I think, adds to the fear and the frustration of people, because if government doesn’t know what it’s doing, well then people feel they’re really alone,” Mr. Cuomo added.

After Mr. Pence visited Washington State this week to signal the administration’s support for the state, where 14 deaths have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle area, he praised its governor, Jay Inslee. Mr. Trump then called Mr. Inslee a “snake.”“Let me just tell you we have a lot of problems with the governor,” Mr. Trump said in Atlanta on Friday. “So Mike may be happy with him, but I’m not, OK?”Mr. Inslee wrote on Twitter that it was “important for leaders to speak with one voice.”“I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page,” he said.Mr. Trump has also sought to contain public alarm by registering fewer cases of the coronavirus, a decision that public health experts say risks misleading Americans about where the virus has spread. The president said he would prefer not to let 3,533 people on a cruise ship held off the coast of San Francisco to disembark onto American soil, even if they were placed into quarantine, in part because it would inflate the number of American infections. Nineteen crew members and two passengers of the ship have tested positive for the coronavirus.Two passengers on the ship, Cookie Clark, 76, and her husband, Joe Clark, 81, of Oakdale, Calif., said they had been watching the news constantly and were angry when they heard Mr. Trump say on Friday that he preferred the ship not dock in the United States.“As American citizens, we have a right to be back on U.S. soil,” Mr. Clark said.Ms. Clark, a retired realtor, said she was appalled. “We’re just numbers to him,” she said.Josh Michaud, an associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that it was in the public’s interest to know where cases of the virus were as soon as possible.“That’s going to be the foundation for developing an effective response. You need to know where the disease is to erect the resources,” Mr. Michaud said. “If you don’t, you’re flying blind.”Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting from New York and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco. After Mr. Pence visited Washington State this week to signal the administration’s support for the state, where 14 deaths have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle area, he praised its governor, Jay Inslee. Mr. Trump then called Mr. Inslee a “snake.”“Let me just tell you we have a lot of problems with the governor,” Mr. Trump said in Atlanta on Friday. “So Mike may be happy with him, but I’m not, OK?”Mr. Inslee wrote on Twitter that it was “important for leaders to speak with one voice.”“I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page,” he said.Mr. Trump has also sought to contain public alarm by registering fewer cases of the coronavirus, a decision that public health experts say risks misleading Americans about where the virus has spread. The president said he would prefer not to let 3,533 people on a cruise ship held off the coast of San Francisco to disembark onto American soil, even if they were placed into quarantine, in part because it would inflate the number of American infections.

A former real estate developer turned conservative bomb-thrower, Mr. Meadows made his name as a disrupter of the system, clashing repeatedly with House Republican leaders over spending, immigration and other issues, and inciting the rebellion that forced Speaker John A. Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded.

Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.“It’s a great move by the president,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows’s appointment. “Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he’s a great wartime consigliere and we’re heading into election season. Mark understands the president’s electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.”While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump’s racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings’s memorial service that talked about the value of the “unexpected friendship.”“I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,” Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. “We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he’s someone who makes things about policy and not people.”Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows’s policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. “I don’t see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,” she said. “I don’t think that’s possible. And if he thinks that’s possible, he’s probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.”Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described “fat nerd” and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate.

Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. “2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,” he said that year. He later called it “probably a poor choice of words on my part,” and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in “American Carnage.”Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the “Access Hollywood” tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta’s book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman — so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. “Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,” former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. “They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.”Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.

Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump’s.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to “actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.” Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows “one of my best friends,” and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president’s defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump’s camp. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney’s corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.“Mark is always up for the challenge,” Mr. Gaetz said. “We all knew when Mark wasn’t running for re-election that he didn’t lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it’s no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.” But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president.

Like other Americans, veterans have benefited from a roaring economy and a robust labor market. But as a group, they are often hampered by the difficulty of converting skills gained in wars to private-sector jobs, a lack of strong professional networks and a culture of treating veterans as charity cases.Underemployment is one of the greatest issues faced by returning veterans — and by their spouses, who often lose ground through constant relocations. Veterans are 37 percent more likely to be underemployed than nonveterans, a recent study by LinkedIn found.“Underemployment with this group is very concerning,” said Sarah Roberts, the company’s head of Military and Veteran Programs.Unlike students, many of whom choose their majors, a majority of people enlisted in the military are assigned their tasks and points of focus. When they leave, many veterans are eager to shift gears but lack clear pathways to do so.“About 55 percent of vets in transition want to do something totally different than what they did in the military,” Ms. Roberts said. Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has put together several programs to help place veterans in jobs, concede this is among the chief obstacles.

But as a group, they are often hampered by the difficulty of converting skills gained in wars to private-sector jobs, a lack of strong professional networks and a culture of treating veterans as charity cases.Underemployment is one of the greatest issues faced by returning veterans — and by their spouses, who often lose ground through constant relocations. Veterans are 37 percent more likely to be underemployed than nonveterans, a recent study by LinkedIn found.“Underemployment with this group is very concerning,” said Sarah Roberts, the company’s head of Military and Veteran Programs.Unlike students, many of whom choose their majors, a majority of people enlisted in the military are assigned their tasks and points of focus. When they leave, many veterans are eager to shift gears but lack clear pathways to do so.“About 55 percent of vets in transition want to do something totally different than what they did in the military,” Ms. Roberts said. Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has put together several programs to help place veterans in jobs, concede this is among the chief obstacles. Veterans, particularly those without college degrees, are often pushed toward low-skill jobs even though their training and the culture of the military might well translate into other types of positions. A clear pipeline to those jobs, however, does not exist for veterans.“The employers are saying ‘It’s not our job to train them,’” said Joan Lynch, the chief content and programming officer at WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign that focuses on labor in the United States. “So whose job is it to train veterans for the work force? The military? No; they teach them to defend our nation. Employers aren’t doing it, either.”Many jobs require licenses and training for skills that veterans learned in combat, particularly in health care. Many veterans who acquired deep knowledge and specialized emergency response techniques, for example, would have no immediate access to the long credentialing process to become a physician assistant.Ms. Lynch said she had encountered many returning medics who were unable to immediately translate their skills into jobs — even when they had privately tutored medical residents on skills like suturing — because they lacked a license. At the same time, those extensive experiences may not apply in other, often lower-wage jobs for which they are vastly overqualified.“These people have about $1 million of training that the government has put into them,” Ms. Lynch said. “But they don’t have one credit toward a professional degree, and they end up being turned down for jobs delivering dry cleaning. It breaks your heart.”Under the most recent Defense Department budget bill, Congress authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess a possible partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems in which veterans can earn credit toward a master’s degree in physician assistant studies for their military operational work and medic training.Dr. David W. Callaway, an emergency physician at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., started a program in 2015 to teach veterans to translate their military medical training for civilian hospital settings.

His team spearheaded a partnership among Atrium Health, Wake Forest School of Medicine and the Defense Department to create a program that allows Special Operations combat medics to earn master’s degree credit toward a physician assistant license while serving in operational units.The program relied on private donor funding, even a local high school fund-raiser. Congress has authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess scaling the partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems.State governments, however, are best equipped to take on this issue, experts say.“We need to reform the occupational licensing laws,” said Rebecca Burgess, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “This could help veterans and military spouses whose unemployment rates have skyrocketed.”Indeed, the unemployment rate for military spouses is 24 percent, in large part because of frequent relocations and an inability to transfer occupational licenses from state to state. Last year, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona signed a bill to recognize out-of-state licenses in many areas to permit workers to become licensed in Arizona without additional training or education.Veterans leave the military with educational benefits coveted by most American high school students. In addition to the G.I. Bill, which provides 36 months of tuition payments and housing allowances, veterans have many other programs to draw on, such as an additional nine months of subsidized education for those pursuing STEM-related degrees and extensive new transition training programs.“Because of all these programs, veterans are better equipped to reach the American dream than their nonveteran counterparts,” said Margarita Devlin, the principal deputy under secretary for benefits at the Department of Veterans Affairs.But there are often complications, especially for those who have served for many years and now have families to support.

But most people have families, work full time and are nontraditional students.”Many veterans also lack strong networks outside their own community to help them navigate the work force.Ms. Roberts of LinkedIn looked at veteran networks that were composed of about 28 percent other veterans and compared them with nonveteran networks, which were made up of less than 2 percent veterans.“About 70 percent of job seekers find employment through a referral or someone in their network,” she said. “So trying to be intentional about connecting with people outside their networks is important.”Certain industries have discovered a set of veterans’ skills that transfer from across service branches, such as the defense and security sectors; various technology companies are also catching on.Executives at Parsable, a start-up that tried to transition industrial workers from paper to technology, aims to hire 10 percent of its staff from the veteran pool; they currently have about 6 percent, said Lawrence Whittle, the company’s chief executive.“From our perspective, we made it a strategy, and they proved to be very talented and applicable to our business,” he said. “The tax incentives are there, the moral incentives are still there, but in the tech space, those are not really a big influence because of the supply and demand issues.” “Some people think if you have the G.I.

Tax incentives also helped.“For a long time, fund-raising was centered around the idea that this is a struggling population,” Mr. Hubbard said.“There were a lot of organizations that were able to use the opportunity to say that veterans are broken or damaged or need our support,” he said. “But this is actually counterproductive because the country sees the veterans in that image.” This, he said, makes some employers reluctant to hire them.Other experts agreed, saying this often led veterans to gravitate toward jobs that were easily secured but below their skill and experience levels.“There used to be this corporate concept that ‘We are going to hire veterans,’” said Ms. Lynch of WorkingNation. “What that did in reality is turn hiring vets into a charity case, and their retention rate was very low.”She said the veterans and private-sector cultures both needed to adjust. “Good companies are getting smart about the training,” she said.Ms. Lynch said that, in discussions with veterans and private-sector managers, a theme had emerged.“We have a system in place where we have boot camp where you spend three months preparing someone in a certain environment, and then they come out,” she said, reflecting on those conversations. “Why don’t we have a reboot camp to do the opposite and build them back into the workplace?’” For many years, policies and public campaigns meant to increase veteran employment focused on trying to appeal to a mix of patriotism and pity for a group that was believed to be damaged by conflict and set back by years out of the civilian work force, said Mr. Hubbard and several other experts.

"It was the question that followed former Mayor Pete Buttigieg everywhere he went when he first announced his presidential campaign: Is the country really ready to send a gay man to the White House?But soon, it seemed, the novelty wore off.

Would he be able to unify the fractured Democratic Party?

United States, said in a tweet last week shortly after Mr. Buttigieg ended his campaign that she was still in awe that he got as far as he did.If you had asked her seven years ago whether an openly gay candidate could credibly run for president in 2020, she wrote on Twitter, “I would have said you were nuts.” In an interview a few days later, Ms. Kaplan said she was still just as struck by Mr. Buttigieg’s success. But just as surprising, she said, is “that there’s a failure to understand history — and a very recent history.”“On the one hand, people over-assume acceptance and equality. And on the other hand, there is no question the L.G.B.T.Q. movement has achieved equality at a speed that probably no other modern movement has,” Ms. Kaplan added. “And those things kind of have to live in tension.” But many, especially those who have fought for L.G.B.T. equality for decades and have seen society grow more tolerant but not entirely accepting, say that Mr. Buttigieg’s contribution to history will be misunderstood and diminished if the main takeaway is that the first openly gay man to have a serious shot at the presidency elicited a collective shrug from a country, as if the country had moved on from its homophobic past.Roberta Kaplan, who argued the 2013 Supreme Court case that overturned a federal law limiting recognition of marriage to heterosexual couples, Windsor v.

One was the reality of certain progressive activists, rival Democrats, social media and many of the reporters who covered him, which was focused on why he shouldn’t or couldn’t win the nomination, his supporters said.

One was the reality of certain progressive activists, rival Democrats, social media and many of the reporters who covered him, which was focused on why he shouldn’t or couldn’t win the nomination, his supporters said. “The too-isms always followed him,” said Tom Sheridan, a consultant in Washington who has worked with Congress to expand legal protections for people with AIDS and disabilities. “He was too young, too straight-acting, too boring, too inexperienced because he was mayor of a city that was too small.”To many who felt a sense of empowerment from his campaign, though, those misgivings felt disconnected from their reality.Mr. Buttigieg described the gratitude and optimism he often encountered when he was traveling the country, and acknowledged it was so powerful it took him aback at first. “Even I thought, ‘OK, maybe this is not all that much of an event,’” he said in an interview last year.Strangers would approach him and try to convey how much it meant to see someone so public and so prominent talk about his experience as an L.G.B.T. person. One was just 9, a boy in Denver who told Mr. Buttigieg at a rally a few days before he dropped out of the race, “I want to be brave like you,” and asked, “Would you help me tell the world I’m gay, too?”Sometimes they were much older, like the flight attendant who was so overcome with emotion when he encountered Mr. Buttigieg at an airport that he was unable to speak. “He just made eye contact and came to the point of tears,” Mr. Buttigieg recalled. “And then walked off not knowing what else to do.”Even in 2020, part of the paradox of running a successful campaign as an openly gay man meant that his orientation could not define him to voters who might not fully accept it. He understood this, and ran his campaign in a way that always sought equilibrium. The protective armor against his sexual orientation seemed in many ways to be his résumé.

In this sense, he too is responsible for the way his sexual orientation was downplayed.But the backlash he faced from fellow Democrats and liberal activists limited his ability to control his campaign’s narrative — a reality of presidential politics that is hardly unique to him. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s early days as a candidate, for instance, were dominated not by questions over her proposed wealth tax or other policy initiatives she wanted to discuss but over her claims of Native American heritage.Mr. Buttigieg had to answer tough criticism from African-American residents of South Bend who said they felt marginalized and neglected. And as he acknowledged, his explanations weren’t always sufficient.These criticisms made him seem like a poor fit for a generation of younger liberals who are deeply concerned about issues of racial justice and inequality. Progressives said they felt he didn’t speak for them; they sometimes heckled him at his events.

Mr. Benenson pointed out that even after Mr. Buttigieg came in first in the delegate count in the Iowa caucuses and a close second place to Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire, large percentages of the country still did not know much about him, making judgments about his inability to attract entire demographics premature.After Iowa, he was viewed more favorably than unfavorably in a poll of registered voters nationwide by Quinnipiac University. (This was not true for Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, the poll found.) But almost a third of those surveyed said they had not heard enough about him to form an opinion.

At noon on Feb. 25, just as Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home, she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States was about to change.“The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said.

The stock market plummeted, cable news blared apocalyptic headlines and by the time Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews early the next morning, his critics were accusing him of sowing confusion on an issue of life or death. The president immediately got on the phone with Alex M. Azar II, his secretary of health and human services. That call scared people, he shouted, referring to Ms. Messonnier’s warnings. Are we at the point that we will have to start closing schools? the president added, alarmed, according to an official who heard about the call.To health officials, the message needed to change with the outbreak. “The epicenter was shifting” as the number of new cases outside China surpassed those inside, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C. “The issue of what this might mean to us became more important.”From the beginning, the Trump administration’s attempts to forestall an outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth. Even as the government’s scientists and leading health experts raised the alarm early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance and doubt at the White House — especially from the president — about spooking financial markets and inciting panic.“It’s going to all work out,” Mr. Trump said as recently as Thursday night. “Everybody has to be calm. It’s going to work out.” The president immediately got on the phone with Alex M. Azar II, his secretary of health and human services.

Are we at the point that we will have to start closing schools? the president added, alarmed, according to an official who heard about the call.To health officials, the message needed to change with the outbreak. “The epicenter was shifting” as the number of new cases outside China surpassed those inside, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C. “The issue of what this might mean to us became more important.”From the beginning, the Trump administration’s attempts to forestall an outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth. Even as the government’s scientists and leading health experts raised the alarm early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance and doubt at the White House — especially from the president — about spooking financial markets and inciting panic.“It’s going to all work out,” Mr. Trump said as recently as Thursday night. “Everybody has to be calm. It’s going to work out.” Health experts say that telling people to remain calm is an effective message in an epidemic, and it is appropriate that it come from the president. Clear, honest communication is also crucial, and the United States has at times criticized China and other governments for being less than transparent.
But from Mr. Trump’s first comments on the virus in January to rambling remarks at the C.D.C. on Friday, health experts say the administration has struggled to strike an effective balance between encouraging calm, providing key information and leading an assertive response. The confused signals from the Trump administration, they say, left Americans unprepared for a public health crisis and delayed their understanding of a virus that has reached at least 28 states, infected more than 300 people and killed at least 17.A Very Big Deal Mr. Azar was at his home in suburban Washington, on Friday, Jan. 3, when Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C.’s director, called to tell him China had potentially discovered a new coronavirus. Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive who helped manage the response to earlier SARS and anthrax outbreaks, told his chief of staff to make sure that the National Security Council was aware.This is a very big deal, Mr. Azar told him.The Trump administration had eliminated the global health unit that had been part of the National Security Council, but within days, a team was meeting daily in the basement of the West Wing, pleading with Chinese officials to allow doctors from the C.D.C. into their country.For weeks, the Chinese refused offers of public health cooperation. “China nice-talked it for a month,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security who was working on the coronavirus effort. “‘Oh, well, thank you for the offer. Blah, blah.’”On Saturday, Jan. 18, a day after the C.D.C. dispatched 100 people to three American airports to screen travelers coming from Wuhan, China, Mr. Azar made his first call to Mr. Trump about the virus, dialing him directly at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. The president insisted on talking about e-cigarettes first, but Mr. Azar steered him to the virus. Mr. Azar was at his home in suburban Washington, on Friday, Jan. 3, when Dr. Robert R.

Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.“We have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.“We have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” On the evening of Jan. 28, a new kind of crisis broke out in the skies.The State Department had ordered the evacuation of the American Consulate in Wuhan and a 747 was in the air. But as it headed for the United States with hundreds of passengers who possibly carried the virus, administration officials in Washington were in a frantic scramble about where it should land.Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, tried to secure some kind of military base in California, but was struggling to cut through Pentagon red tape. In a panic, his staff started booking hundreds of rooms at three hotels in the Los Angeles area, asking for full floors so they could separate potentially infected evacuees from other guests.One idea was to land the plane at the Ontario airport outside Los Angeles, and officials went so far as to schedule, then cancel, a briefing for some members of the California congressional delegation. After hours of wrangling, and with the plane still in the air, Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, said the plane could land at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, which had space to house all of the passengers.Inside the White House, a debate broke out, centered on concerns that had become ever-present since the virus first emerged: How would the government’s actions be perceived by the public? And what would the president think?At issue was whether to impose a federal quarantine order on the evacuees to prevent them from leaving for 14 days. Such authority had not been used since a smallpox outbreak in 1969. But officials had to find some way to make sure the passengers did not leave the base until it was clear they were not infected.

By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day. Any one of them could be the trigger for a new and undetected American outbreak.Over four days in the White House Situation Room, the nation’s top public health and national security officials engaged in a fierce debate over whether to take the extraordinary step of banning travel from China.Public health officials were initially wary. Experts have long recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it is often ineffective and can stymie the response by limiting the movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain the disease. A ban would anger China, they worried, ending any hope of cooperation with American medical teams.Officials at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security argued that China had already proved unwilling to cooperate. A third group inside the White House was worried that the move would incite panic and could roil the financial markets.By Thursday, Jan. 30, the public health officials had come around. Mr. Azar, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic’s center could buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. “There was so much we didn’t know about this virus,” Dr. Redfield said in an interview. “We were rapidly understanding it was much more transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.” By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day.

Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?The president sided with his more aggressive aides, and announced the ban next day.Still, Mr. Trump was publicly upbeat about the effects of the virus. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, “By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government’s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation’s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the administration that it was quickly being resolved.Americans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States.

As Mr. Biden now attempts to leverage his Super Tuesday success and build momentum, Mr. Sanders may face even longer odds in Michigan than he did in 2016. The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state.

Recognizing the stakes here, Mr. Sanders is assailing Mr. Biden for his support of what he called “disastrous trade agreements like Nafta.” And his campaign is airing a commercial in the manufacturing-heavy state that features a former autoworker highlighting the former vice president’s lack of regret for supporting the pact while pointing out that Mr. Sanders has opposed free trade deals.As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.

Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said former Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.” Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary.

In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.

Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest. In suburban Oakland County, for example, Mrs. Clinton won by about five points in 2016. But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state. He said, “everybody in my circle is coalescing around Joe Biden.”At first, he said, black and white voters alike were “looking for President Obama — but instead we went with the one we’ve always felt comfortable with.”Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Dearborn, Mich.

"MADISON, Wis. — Debt has dogged Brian Michelz his entire adult life.It started with an ambulance ride when he was 18 and two hospital stays. Then came college loans. By the time Mr. Michelz made it out into the world, his credit score was so low he could not even get a credit card. He has paid for everything he has ever bought — televisions, furniture, cars — up front. After grocery shopping on Wednesday, his bank account had three dollars in it.Mr. Michelz, 29, has never worn a political T-shirt or been to a campaign rally. But when he voted for the first time in his life, in the primary of 2016, it was for Bernie Sanders.“I wouldn’t say I’m on the left, or a liberal progressive,” Mr. Michelz said in his apartment one morning last week, sitting next to his wife, Sarah Michelz, who had just come home from her work as a nurse. “I feel like Sanders understood — there’s too much medical debt and college debt. I was like, ‘OK, he’s speaking the truth.’”Mr. Sanders has staked his campaign on the promise that he can draw in voters who have felt left out of politics — in particular the young and the working class, especially in regions like the Midwest where Democrats lost to Donald J.

Now, as the fight for the Democratic nomination approaches what could be a final, critical stage with primaries in Michigan and Wisconsin, the future of his candidacy rests on these voters and whether they will turn out in larger numbers than they have so far. The Democratic Party also faces a risk: Should Mr. Sanders lose the nomination, some of his supporters — tired of being offered conventional solutions — could sit out the general election, or vote for Mr. Trump or a third-party candidate.For voters like Mr. Michelz (pronounced Michaels), Mr. Sanders has inspired loyalty because he is the rare political leader who has both diagnosed the source of their problems and tried to offer solutions.

After borrowing more money for their education than their parents did, many are treading water in jobs that do not pay enough and delaying marriage and children.Mr. Sanders’s message has resonated deeply with these voters.

He is radical. His programs cost too much. He knows the senator is not perfect. But he likes his direction.He plans on voting for Mr. Sanders in the Wisconsin primary next month. But he is not sure what he will do in November if Mr. Sanders is not the nominee.Mr. Sanders is certainly a better choice than Mr. Biden, he said, who looks like “an ordinary, run-of-the-mill politician,” who is influenced by money and power in the same old ways.“When I look at him, I don’t see real change or anything like that,” he said.Early SkepticismMr. Michelz grew up in a large house with a pond at the end of a long driveway a few miles from Yale, a tiny town in rural Eastern Michigan known for its annual bologna festival. His grandparents lived nearby and owned an apple orchard. He spent summers clearing it of brush and weeds.His grandfather was political — an avid Rush Limbaugh listener who always voted Republican. But his parents, absorbed with their own troubles, were not. His father, who worked on telephone lines, abused his mother, sometimes violently. He could be loving, playing catch with Mr. Michelz and his brother after work. But he could also be frightening, once shoving Mr. Michelz across the living room when he misbehaved. When Mr. Michelz was 13, his father killed himself.The experience turned Mr. Michelz into a skeptical person who did not trust easily. He developed a keen sense for when adults were being sincere — and when they were not.“I sought out anything that was real,” he said.News and popular culture — and by extension politics — felt fake. One day something was true, and the next day it was not. He remembers seeing something on TV that said chocolate was bad for you.

News was lumped in with that.”In 2008, the financial crisis tore through his family. His mother lost their house that she had fought to keep after his father’s suicide, and she and her two sons had to move in with Mr. Michelz’s grandparents.That year, when Mr. Michelz was 18, he took a part-time job cleaning out houses after they had been foreclosed on. He saw closets stuffed with cherished possessions — photographs, prom dresses, watches — and threw these things into dumpsters. Once, a man begged him to open the door so he could retrieve his belongings.It was a searing experience and the beginning of his political education.“When I hear Bernie’s forgiving debt and people say, ‘It’s way too expensive,’ I think, you did the craziest thing for the banks,” he said of the bailouts. “Yet normal families were thrown in the street, literally.”He continued: “The middle finger was given to our family, while the rich guys got off scot-free.” “It was like everything was for sale,” he said. “I always thought reality TV shows were really embarrassing.

He started paying more attention to the news. He was spending a lot of time online and started looking up things he had heard, like the line from the protesters at Occupy Wall Street that the top 1 percent of Americans had more wealth than close to half of the rest of the country.“At first I thought it couldn’t be true,” he said. “It just didn’t make sense.”It was around this time he first saw Mr. Sanders — on his grandparents’ TV talking about health care. Mr. Michelz looked him up and saw that he had been saying the same thing for years. He liked what he heard. He thought about his $24,000 in medical debt and how arbitrary it seemed.

As for the economy, nothing made sense. He spent years in college classes learning teaching, but ended up working in a tire store because it paid better. He went to college, just like everybody said he should, but is now working in a job that does not require a degree.Mr. Sanders seemed to be telling him why his life looked and felt the way it did. His financial instability was not some individual failure, but a function of a broader economic system that had become so unequal that fixing it was a moral calling.What Mr. Sanders proposed “was creating the conditions to make people’s lives less stressful,” he said.And as for the arguments against Mr. Sanders — all these things he wanted would cost too much and would cause economic chaos and people to suffer — that was already happening, he thought. Domestic violence, families breaking apart, children not getting the care they needed — the common thread was the economic system.The fact that Mr. Sanders was rejected by the establishment merely proved his worth for Mr. Michelz.“I knew it was OK to be hated by the mainstream,” he said.So on March 8, 2016, he rode to the polling station in Yale with his grandfather. Rush Limbaugh was on the radio. When they walked inside, he voted for Mr. Sanders and his grandfather voted for Mr. Trump. It was his first time voting, but he does not remember feeling much of anything.“I just thought, I’m going to at least put my voice in a direction, even if no one hears it,” he said.

Mr. Michelz never considered voting for Mr. Trump, finding him unappealing and bothered by his stance on climate change. But he does not hate him. Some of the people he loves most voted for him. He understands why.“The truth is, they are speaking to a frustrated America,” Mr. Michelz said of political candidates. “That’s why someone who is as ridiculous as Trump got elected. People wanted to see someone who wasn’t proper, who wasn’t afraid of the establishment. He appealed to people who thought it was all becoming a sham.”He added: “It’s the same thing with Bernie.”A few months later, Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee.In November, he did not vote. Looking back, he does not regret it.This NovemberFour years later, he has even more at stake.Mr. Michelz is now married. After years of blocking out his ruined credit score, he cares a lot about it. He still cannot get a loan, which means leasing a new car is out of the question. He wants badly to buy one with heated seats for Sarah. Instead they are stuck with their old models. He recently poured $3,000 in bonuses from his job at the tire shop into his car.Sometimes Mr. Michelz worries about not providing enough for his family.“I think about Sarah,” he said. “She’s around doctors every day. Does she ever have a thought, ‘I could be with someone who makes way more money?’ I know that’s irrational. On the one hand I’m bothered by it. But on the other, I know I’m giving 110 percent.”So, he tries to show her every day that he loves her. He often buys her flowers. Last Thursday, a small vase in the kitchen held two carnations and a rose. Mr. Michelz never considered voting for Mr. Trump, finding him unappealing and bothered by his stance on climate change.

This year he found that he loved Andrew Yang.“To me, he made Bernie seem outdated,” he said. When Mr. Yang dropped out, “I was bummed, but I was happy, too. His message got out there.”He feels wiser now. He no longer believes the American story that everyone should be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.“That’s a big lie that benefits the rich and keeps the system the same,” he said.He will still vote for Mr. Sanders, though he knows it is a long shot.“Even if it doesn’t work, I’m going to throw my vote that way,” Mr. Michelz said. “I have nothing to lose.” All of this has brought him back to politics, which he now knows is the thread that runs through many of these problems.

"WASHINGTON — Erik Prince, the security contractor with close ties to the Trump administration, has in recent years helped recruit former American and British spies for secretive intelligence-gathering operations that included infiltrating Democratic congressional campaigns, labor organizations and other groups considered hostile to the Trump agenda, according to interviews and documents.One of the former spies, an ex-MI6 officer named Richard Seddon, helped run a 2017 operation to copy files and record conversations in a Michigan office of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers’ unions in the nation. Mr. Seddon directed an undercover operative to secretly tape the union’s local leaders and try to gather information that could be made public to damage the organization, documents show.Using a different alias the next year, the same undercover operative infiltrated the congressional campaign of Abigail Spanberger, then a former C.I.A. officer who went on to win an important House seat in Virginia as a Democrat. The campaign discovered the operative and fired her.Both operations were run by Project Veritas, a conservative group that has gained attention using hidden cameras and microphones for sting operations on news organizations, Democratic politicians and liberal advocacy groups. Mr. Seddon’s role in the teachers’ union operation — detailed in internal Project Veritas emails that have emerged from the discovery process of a court battle between the group and the union — has not previously been reported, nor has Mr. Prince’s role in recruiting Mr. Seddon for the group’s activities.

Both Project Veritas and Mr. Prince have ties to President Trump’s aides and family. Whether any Trump administration officials or advisers to the president were involved in the operations, even tacitly, is unclear. But the effort is a glimpse of a vigorous private campaign to try to undermine political groups or individuals perceived to be in opposition to Mr. Trump’s agenda.Mr. Prince, the former head of Blackwater Worldwide and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has at times served as an informal adviser to Trump administration officials. He worked with the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn during the presidential transition. In 2017, he met with White House and Pentagon officials to pitch a plan to privatize the Afghan war using contractors in lieu of American troops. Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, rejected the idea.Mr. Prince appears to have become interested in using former spies to train Project Veritas operatives in espionage tactics sometime during the 2016 presidential campaign. Reaching out to several intelligence veterans — and occasionally using Mr. Seddon to make the pitch — Mr. Prince said he wanted the Project Veritas employees to learn skills like how to recruit sources and how to conduct clandestine recordings, among other surveillance techniques.James O’Keefe, the head of Project Veritas, declined to answer detailed questions about Mr. Prince, Mr. Seddon and other topics, but he called his group a “proud independent news organization” that is involved in dozens of investigations. He said that numerous sources were coming to the group “providing confidential documents, insights into internal processes and wearing hidden cameras to expose corruption and misconduct.” Both Project Veritas and Mr. Prince have ties to President Trump’s aides and family.

A spokesman for Mr. Prince declined to comment. Emails sent to Mr. Seddon went unanswered.Mr. Prince is under investigation by the Justice Department over whether he lied to a congressional committee examining Russian interference in the 2016 election, and for possible violations of American export laws. Last year, the House Intelligence Committee made a criminal referral to the Justice Department about Mr. Prince, saying he lied about the circumstances of his meeting with a Russian banker in the Seychelles in January 2017.Once a small operation running on a shoestring budget, Project Veritas in recent years has had a surge in donations from both private donors and conservative foundations. According to its latest publicly available tax filing, Project Veritas received $8.6 million in contributions and grants in 2018. Mr. O’Keefe earned about $387,000.Last year, the group received a $1 million contribution made through the law firm Alston & Bird, a financial document obtained by The New York Times showed. A spokesman for the firm said that Alston & Bird “has never contributed to Project Veritas on its own behalf, nor is it a client of ours.” The spokesman declined to say on whose behalf the contribution was made.The financial document also listed the names of others who gave much smaller amounts to Project Veritas last year. Several of them confirmed their donations.The group has also become intertwined with the political activities of Mr. Trump and his family. The Trump Foundation gave $20,000 to Project Veritas in 2015, the year that Mr. Trump began his bid for the presidency. The next year, during a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump claimed without substantiation that videos released by Mr. O’Keefe showed that Mrs. Clinton and President Barack Obama had paid people to incite violence at rallies for Mr. Trump.In a book published in 2018, Mr. O’Keefe wrote that Mr. Trump years earlier had encouraged him to infiltrate Columbia University and obtain Mr. Obama’s records.Last month, Project Veritas made public secretly recorded video of a longtime ABC News correspondent who was critical of the network’s political coverage and its emphasis on business considerations over journalism. Many conservatives have gleefully pounced on Project Veritas’s disclosures, including one particularly influential voice: Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son. A spokesman for Mr. Prince declined to comment. Emails sent to Mr. Seddon went unanswered.Mr. Prince is under investigation by the Justice Department over whether he lied to a congressional committee examining Russian interference in the 2016 election, and for possible violations of American export laws. Last year, the House Intelligence Committee made a criminal referral to the Justice Department about Mr. Prince, saying he lied about the circumstances of his meeting with a Russian banker in the Seychelles in January 2017.Once a small operation running on a shoestring budget, Project Veritas in recent years has had a surge in donations from both private donors and conservative foundations. According to its latest publicly available tax filing, Project Veritas received $8.6 million in contributions and grants in 2018. Mr. O’Keefe earned about $387,000.Last year, the group received a $1 million contribution made through the law firm Alston & Bird, a financial document obtained by The New York Times showed.

The website for Mr. O’Keefe’s coming wedding listed Donald Trump Jr. as an invited guest.Mr. Prince invited Project Veritas operatives — including Mr. O’Keefe — to his family’s Wyoming ranch for training in 2017, The Intercept reported last year. Mr. O’Keefe and others shared social media photos of taking target practice with guns at the ranch, including one post from Mr. O’Keefe saying that with the training, Project Veritas will be “the next great intelligence agency.” Mr. Prince had hired a former MI6 officer to help train the Project Veritas operatives, The Intercept wrote, but it did not identify the officer.Mr. Seddon regularly updated Mr. O’Keefe about the operation against the Michigan teachers’ union, according to internal Project Veritas emails, where the language of the group’s leaders is marbled with spy jargon.They used a code name — LibertyU — for their operative inside the organization, Marisa Jorge, who graduated from Liberty University in Virginia, one of the nation’s largest Christian colleges. Mr. Seddon wrote that Ms. Jorge “copied a great many documents from the file room,” and Mr. O’Keefe bragged that the group would be able to get “a ton more access agents inside the educational establishment.”The emails refer to other operations, including weekly case updates, along with training activities that involved “operational targeting.” Project Veritas redacted specifics about those operations from the messages.In August 2017, Ms. Jorge wrote to Mr. Seddon that she had managed to record a local union leader talking about Ms. DeVos and other topics.“Good stuff,” Mr. Seddon wrote back. “Did you receive the spare camera yet?”As education secretary, Ms. DeVos has been a vocal critic of teachers’ unions, saying in 2018 that they have a “stranglehold” over politicians at the federal and state levels. She and Mr. Prince grew up in Michigan, where their father made a fortune in the auto parts business.AFT Michigan sued Project Veritas in federal court, alleging trespassing, eavesdropping and other offenses. The teachers’ union is asking for more than $3 million in damages, accusing the group of being a “vigilante organization which claims to be dedicated to exposing corruption.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — One day last month, Mark Meadows went on Fox News to defend President Trump’s decision to begin purging the government of officials perceived to be disloyal to him. “Part of his administration is trying to defeat the Trump agenda,” Mr. Meadows declared.Two days later, he was back on Fox defending Mr. Trump’s attacks on prosecutors seeking a long prison sentence for his convicted friend Roger J. Stone Jr. “The president was right to call it out,” Mr. Meadows said. A week after that, Mr. Meadows was on Fox again, offering commentary on a Democratic debate. “The clear winner tonight,” he concluded, “was Donald Trump.”For three years, Mr. Trump could reliably count on tuning into his favorite television network and finding his favorite congressman carrying his flag in one political battle after another. Now Mr. Meadows, a retiring Republican representative from North Carolina and onetime leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, will transform himself from outside ally to inside consigliere as he takes over as Mr. Trump’s fourth White House chief of staff in 38 months.Whether he can be any more successful than his predecessors in managing a White House that defies management remains to be seen, but Mr. Meadows takes over at a moment of singular challenges for the president.

Mr. Meadows has an advantage none of them did in that he has been a political confidant and ardent champion for much longer before taking the job and many in Mr. Trump’s circle were encouraged by his ascension. But he has never been tested like this before.“The president hasn’t gone through four chiefs of staff in three and a half years because he’s trying to figure out how to govern,” said Chris Whipple, the author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of those who served in the role. “He’s gone through four chiefs because he’s not interested in governing. He lives to campaign — to divide, demonize and disrupt — not to get things done.” Reince Priebus, John F.

Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded. He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor, on the floor during a contentious vote. In that sense, then, Mr. Meadows may make sense.

Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.“It’s a great move by the president,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows’s appointment. “Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he’s a great wartime consigliere and we’re heading into election season. Mark understands the president’s electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.”While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump’s racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings’s memorial service that talked about the value of the “unexpected friendship.”“I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,” Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. “We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he’s someone who makes things about policy and not people.”Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows’s policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. “I don’t see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,” she said. “I don’t think that’s possible. And if he thinks that’s possible, he’s probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.”Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described “fat nerd” and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate.

Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. “2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,” he said that year. He later called it “probably a poor choice of words on my part,” and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in “American Carnage.”Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the “Access Hollywood” tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta’s book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman — so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. “Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,” former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. “They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.”Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.

The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work. But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president. At one point early last year, during testimony by Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump’s.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to “actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.” Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows “one of my best friends,” and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president’s defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump’s camp. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney’s corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.“Mark is always up for the challenge,” Mr. Gaetz said. “We all knew when Mark wasn’t running for re-election that he didn’t lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it’s no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.” But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president.

"WASHINGTON — A manipulated video featuring Joseph R.

Biden Jr. and spread by President Trump over the weekend has ratcheted up an online war that has put Twitter and Facebook in the middle of a debate over political speech.The campaigns have fought for months over misinformation targeting Mr. Biden, and the latest salvo has taken on greater import with his surge in the Democratic primaries. In response to such misinformation, the tech platforms have written new and diverging rules on political speech. On Sunday, Twitter tagged the video in question as manipulated content, while Facebook left the video intact without any flags about the false content.The video came from a stump speech by Mr. Biden on Saturday in Kansas City, Mo., where he appeared to struggle through a sentence and with halting words said, “We can only re-elect Donald Trump.” But the rest of Mr. Biden’s sentence was selectively edited out. In full, Mr. Biden was stressing the need for Democrats to unite against Mr. Trump. “We can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It’s got to be a positive campaign,” he said. Through Saturday, manipulated video of Mr. Biden’s words caught fire.Dan Scavino, Mr. Trump’s assistant and the White House director of social media, shared a version of the video on Saturday on Twitter and Facebook.“Sleepy Joe in St. Louis, Missouri today: ‘We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump. #KAG2020LandslideVictory,” Mr. Scavino wrote with a link to the video.Mr. Trump then retweeted Mr. Scavino’s post late Saturday.

After users flagged the video to Twitter on Sunday, the company said it had determined the video violated its rules against synthetic and manipulated video and labeled the video as manipulated content. By that point, it had been viewed more than five million times and retweeted more than 20,000 times. It was the first time Twitter had applied a policy announced in February against fake and misleading videos. Facebook, however, did not remove or flag the video as misinformation, angering the Biden campaign.“Facebook’s malfeasance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false information is a national crisis in this respect,” Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “It is also an unconscionable act of putting profit above not just our country, but every country,” he added. “Facebook won’t say it, but it is apparent to all who have examined their conduct and policies: They care first and foremost about money and, to that end, are willing to serve as one of the world’s most effective mediums for the spread of vile lies.”Mr. Biden’s campaign has complained about false online ads by Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign before, beginning last October with an ad that ran on Facebook and other social media outlets that asserted that Mr. Biden had bribed the Ukrainian government to stop an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.Facebook refused to remove that video, saying false speech by politicians and their campaigns was permitted as an important facet to political discourse. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, reinforced that view with a speech on free expression at Georgetown University last October where he explained that political speech was one of the most vetted forms of discourse and that it was important for the public to hear from politicians, including lies.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump will skip the annual bipartisan St. Patrick’s Day luncheon hosted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill this week, White House officials said Sunday, the latest in a series of tit-for-tat snubs between the two most powerful leaders in the nation’s capital.In rejecting Ms. Pelosi’s invitation, Mr. Trump becomes the first president to miss the event since George W. Bush when he was on the verge of war with Iraq in 2003. But Mr. Trump’s aides made no effort to disguise the reason behind the decision, openly attributing it to the president’s unhappiness with the speaker, who led the drive that resulted in his impeachment in the House in December.“Since the speaker has chosen to tear this nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the president will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.Instead, Mr. Trump will host Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland at the White House on Thursday for his own celebration of the holiday and friendship. PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump will skip the annual bipartisan St. Patrick’s Day luncheon hosted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill this week, White House officials said Sunday, the latest in a series of tit-for-tat snubs between the two most powerful leaders in the nation’s capital.In rejecting Ms. Pelosi’s invitation, Mr. Trump becomes the first president to miss the event since George W.

When he arrived at the Capitol for his State of the Union address last month, near the end of his Senate trial, Mr. Trump refused to shake Ms. Pelosi’s hand, as was customary, and she ripped up her copy of his speech after he delivered it.The day after the Senate acquitted him, also largely along party lines, Mr. Trump attended the National Prayer Breakfast with Ms. Pelosi. As she sat only a few feet away, he made a barely veiled attack on her faith, branding her as hypocritical for saying she prays for him. He told the clerics in the audience that he did not “like people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that’s not so.”The St. Patrick’s Day lunch traces its history to 1983, when President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, and Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill, a Democrat from Massachusetts, both of Irish descent, established the tradition. It became an annual affair in 1987, and only four times since then have presidents missed it.

"The State Department on Sunday advised Americans against traveling on cruise ships, warning that they presented a higher risk of coronavirus infection and made U.S. citizens vulnerable to possible international travel restrictions, including quarantines.The decision came after President Trump resisted requests from administration officials to publicly urge older travelers to avoid cruise ships and plane travel, saying he thought it would harm those industries, according to two people familiar with the discussions.“U.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship,” the State Department wrote in an alert posted to its website Sunday.Americans should not rely on being evacuated if other countries subject them to quarantine, the department said.

The guidance signaled another escalation in the Trump administration’s efforts to ward off the fast-growing spread of the virus, and another instance of what appeared to be separation between health officials and the president, who has repeatedly registered skepticism over making statements he believes are alarmist.
It came as federal and state officials scrambled to contain a cluster of cases on the 3,500-passenger Grand Princess, which has idled off the coast of California. Twenty-one people onboard tested positive for the coronavirus, and it was on its way to dock on Monday at the Port of Oakland, the vessel’s operator said.The decision to caution Americans capped weeks of discussions on the Trump administration’s interagency task force about how to communicate alarm about cruise ships after hundreds of Americans, including some who tested positive for the virus, were evacuated from the Diamond Princess off the coast of Japan, a process rife with confusion and disorder.It was Vice President Mike Pence, who is overseeing the federal government’s coronavirus efforts, who signed off on the State Department’s announcement and Stephen E. Biegun, the deputy secretary of state and another task force member, who formalized it, a senior official familiar with the decision said. The final call on Sunday did not reach Mr. Trump’s level, the official said.The White House did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The State Department guidance came a day after Mr. Pence held a meeting with cruise ship industry officials about what, if anything, the federal government might do. Some executives were surprised to see the department’s warning after it emerged. One senior administration official familiar with what was said at the meeting said industry officials seemed to be looking for the federal government to take action as opposed to cruise ship companies instituting their own more rigorous policies. According to an official with knowledge of the task force talks, at least four members of the group pushed for the State Department to caution Americans against cruises: Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert P. Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response; and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the new coronavirus response coordinator.The talks picked up last week as the Grand Princess waited for a confirmation of possible infections on the ship. A 71-year-old man died after traveling on a previous leg of the cruise, a round trip from San Francisco to Mexico. Another passenger from that leg of the trip also tested positive for the virus and is being treated in California.After the Grand Princess docks, those aboard will be taken to military facilities around the country to be tested and quarantined for 14 days, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.About 1,000 passengers who are California residents will go to Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., or the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. Residents of other states will be taken to Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas or Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Ga.More than 500 coronavirus infections have been confirmed by lab tests in the United States as of Sunday, and 22 people have died so far from them.“This is a fluid situation,” the State Department notice said, adding that the C.D.C. recommends that older adults, in addition to those with underlying health problems, should avoid any setting that makes them more vulnerable to disease.“This entails avoiding crowded places, avoiding nonessential travel such as long plane trips, and especially avoiding embarking on cruise ships,” the alert said.

In response to the State Department, Carnival Corporation said in a statement on Sunday that its brands, which include Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Cunard, enhanced its health screening protocols to include thermal scans and temperature checks before boarding and onboard.“We are currently in discussions with the C.D.C., World Health Organization and other health officials,” the statement said, noting that the cruise industry committed to an aggressive response plan when it met with Mr. Pence on Saturday. “The health and safety of our guests and crew is our highest priority, and cruising remains one of the most attractive vacation options available.”On Sunday morning, Dr. Fauci appeared to preview the State Department’s announcement, saying on “Fox News Sunday” that older Americans in poor health need to avoid large crowds and plane travel.“Absolutely don’t get on a cruise ship,” he said.Tariro Mzezewa contributed reporting from New York.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Defending against criticism of his handling of the coronavirus, President Trump suggested the other day that he could hardly have been expected to be ready for such an unexpected crisis.“Who would have thought?” he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nerve center for the government’s response to the outbreak. “Who would have thought we would even be having the subject?”Actually, quite a few people would have thought, and did — including the officials in his own White House who were in charge of preparing for just such a pandemic only to have their office shut down in a reorganization in 2018. “The threat of pandemic flu is the No. 1 health security concern,” one of the officials said the day before that happened two years ago. “Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.”For a president who lives in the moment, rarely planning too far ahead, the coronavirus has proved to be a leadership challenge he was not prepared for either. The outbreak that has rattled the nation does not respond to Mr. Trump’s favorite instruments of power: It cannot be cowed by Twitter posts, it cannot be shot down by drones, it cannot be overcome by party solidarity, it cannot be overpowered by campaign rally chants.

The outbreak that has rattled the nation does not respond to Mr. Trump’s favorite instruments of power: It cannot be cowed by Twitter posts, it cannot be shot down by drones, it cannot be overcome by party solidarity, it cannot be overpowered by campaign rally chants. Mr. Trump, who is at his strongest politically when he has a human enemy to attack, has seemed less certain of how to take on an invisible killer. The role of calming natural leader is not one that has come easily as he struggles to find the balance between public reassurance and Panglossian dismissiveness. He has predicted that the virus will “miraculously” disappear on its own with warmer weather, suggested a vaccine will be available soon and insisted anyone who wants to be tested can be — all overstated or inaccurate.He has expressed an astonishing lack of knowledge while at the same time claiming to be a medical savant. He has treated the crisis as a partisan battle, wearing his red Keep America Great campaign cap to the C.D.C. and calling the governor presiding over the state with the highest death toll a “snake.” He even admitted that he wanted to leave passengers stranded on a cruise ship rather than see statistics for the number of cases on American soil go up because it would look bad.“If we really want to talk about what is going to potentially create panic in this country, it’s an administration that’s just not being straight with the American public about the extent of this epidemic and the real-life consequences that could be put upon Americans,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Sunday on “Face the Nation” on CBS.
Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a prominent cardiologist who treated former Vice President Dick Cheney and wrote a book with him, said he was convinced that the Trump administration failed to move more quickly to test for the virus after it emerged in China because the White House did not want to admit the scope of the threat.“When the story is finally written,” he said on Sunday, “we’ll come to understand that tens of thousands of lives were placed at risk because of a political decision made by the president.” Mr. Trump, who was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rejected the criticism on Sunday, pointing to the travel restrictions he imposed early on China, later adding limits or warnings to other affected places like Iran and parts of South Korea and Italy.“We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus,” he wrote on Twitter moments after arriving at his golf club in West Palm Beach, where he played with several members of the World Series champion Washington Nationals. “We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!” Mr. Trump, who was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rejected the criticism on Sunday, pointing to the travel restrictions he imposed early on China, later adding limits or warnings to other affected places like Iran and parts of South Korea and Italy.“We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus,” he wrote on Twitter moments after arriving at his golf club in West Palm Beach, where he played with several members of the World Series champion Washington Nationals. “We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!” After initially brushing off warnings by his health secretary as “alarmist,” Mr. Trump in the last two weeks has taken a more assertive public role on the coronavirus, assigning Vice President Mike Pence to lead the government efforts and making multiple appearances to signal that he takes the threat seriously.But he has also taken a business-as-usual approach to the rest of his schedule, refusing to cancel campaign rallies, fund-raisers or social events even as other large gatherings of Americans are scrubbed. Asked by a reporter on Saturday night if he was worried that infections were getting closer to the White House, Mr. Trump said, “No, I’m not concerned at all.”The president then went inside Mar-a-Lago to host a lavish birthday party for the former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump Jr. and turns 51 on Monday, a preview perhaps of the celebration that may be held next month when Melania Trump turns 50. Among those spotted at the revelry were boldface names from Mr. Trump’s circle, including Mr. Pence, Lindsey Graham, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Tucker Carlson and Matt Gaetz.Mr. Trump happily introduced his visitor, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, to Mr. Carlson and other guests in a video shared on social media, boasting that he “gave him a good gift” by not imposing tariffs on Brazil and “that made him much more popular.” Mr. Bolsonaro laughed and agreed.

He has acknowledged that “I didn’t know people died from the flu” — tens of thousands, in fact, each year in the United States — even though, as The Washington Post pointed out, his own grandfather died of influenza during the 1918 epidemic.But he has credited himself with instinctive understanding of the science. “I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said at the C.D.C. on Friday. “People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”Mr. Trump rejected criticism of the slow distribution of test kits, framing it in terms evoking his battle against impeachment. “The tests are all perfect,” he told reporters, “like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right?” — a reference to the rough transcript of his telephone call with Ukraine’s president that led to his own impeachment for abuse of power.The president’s less-than-perfect pronouncements, however, left public health officials straining to reconcile them on the Sunday talk shows. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” about a White House aide’s assertion that the coronavirus had been “contained,” Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, said: “Well, this is a novel virus. It’s a new situation. And the messaging, quite frankly, is hard.” By the president’s own account, the coronavirus has been an education for him.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to walk back the president’s claim that “anyone who wants a test can get a test,” saying on “Fox News Sunday” that it would actually be up to a doctor.Mr. Trump has become such a polarizing figure that even when he is not necessarily wrong, many do not trust him. On Sean Hannity’s Fox News show last week, he called the World Health Organization’s estimated fatality rate of 3.4 percent “a false number,” saying “my hunch” was that it would be under 1 percent. It sounded as if he were substituting his uneducated “hunch” for the judgment of professionals.But in fact, he was reflecting what he had been told by health experts, including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, who have concluded that once the full scope of unreported infections is known, the number of deaths will most likely represent a smaller share, possibly “considerably less than” 1 percent. The W.H.O. has also said the rate may fall.Still, at his appearance at the C.D.C., Mr. Trump had no explanation for why his White House shut down the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense established at the National Security Council in 2016 by President Barack Obama after the 2014 Ebola outbreak, stammering to suggest the coronavirus had been a surprise.“Well, I just don’t think — I just don’t think that somebody is going to — without seeing something, like we saw something happening in China,” Mr. Trump said. “As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially — not from the White House. I mean, you know, we don’t need a lab in the White House. But they saw something happening.”Elizabeth Cameron set up the global health security directorate at the White House for Mr. Obama before turning it over to Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, who ran it for Mr. Trump until May 2018, when he was pushed out and the directorate folded into other parts of the National Security Council. Had it still been around, it would have been charged with preparing for exactly the situation now facing the country.“I think it would have made a difference,” Ms. Cameron said on Sunday. “Monitoring and preparing for every eventuality and having a person and a directorate accountable for that is really important and could have been important in this case.”Chris Cameron contributed reporting from Washington. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to walk back the president’s claim that “anyone who wants a test can get a test,” saying on “Fox News Sunday” that it would actually be up to a doctor.Mr. Trump has become such a polarizing figure that even when he is not necessarily wrong, many do not trust him.

In ordering the evaluation, Judge Collyer relied on a report from Dr. Emily A. Keram, an American psychiatrist who treats U.S. veterans and who examined Mr. Qahtani at Guantánamo and some of his medical records in Saudi Arabia. The report said that Mr. Qahtani spent four or five days in the psychiatric unit of a hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, after an “acute psychotic break” and a suicide attempt in May 2000.Dr. Keram also wrote that Mr. Qahtani suffered a head injury in a car accident when he was a child and was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia. One symptom included hallucinations; he spoke to nonexistent people before he left Saudi Arabia and after his arrival at Guantánamo.Central to Judge Collyer’s order was the contention by Mr. Qahtani’s lawyers that Guantánamo was not equipped to handle his psychiatric illnesses, and that he was entitled to repatriation to culturally appropriate mental health care under the prisoner-of-war provisions in the Army regulations.The provisions give the board members access to both Mr. Qahtani and his clinical records. Recommendations are made by a majority vote, and if repatriation is warranted, it must be done within three months of the decision.Judge Collyer wrote that she agreed with the Justice Department that the use of the mixed medical commission was entering “uncharted territory” and “likely burdensome.”Justice Department and Guantánamo officials did not reply to requests for comment on whether they would appeal or accept the order. The United States could also send Mr. Qahtani to Saudi Arabia for care in lieu of allowing the first-ever mixed medical commission to evaluate him.The need for Mr. Qahtani’s repatriation was “a matter of life and death,” said Ramzi Kassem, one of his lawyers. “We hope he can return to Saudi Arabia, where he will be given the psychiatric care and treatment he needs.” In ordering the evaluation, Judge Collyer relied on a report from Dr. Emily A.

Political contemporaries, the two septuagenarian liberal activists are longtime allies: In 1988, Mr. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vt., was slapped by an “irate citizen” after supporting Mr. Jackson in the state’s caucuses.Michigan’s caucuses that year marked a high point for Mr. Jackson’s campaign.

Biden Jr. in this Midwestern state, he can reclaim ground in the presidential race after losing a majority of states on Super Tuesday largely on the weakness of his support among black voters. Michigan has emerged as a pivotal moment for his campaign, as the race moves into a series of delegate-rich primaries in Southern and Rust Belt states that are expected to be less favorable ground for Mr. Sanders.Yet as he has campaigned across the state, he has drawn overwhelmingly white audiences, raising questions about whether his effort is breaking through with black voters who make up a significant share of the primary electorate. At a Saturday night town-hall-style event in Flint, Mr. Sanders largely ceded the stage to African-American activists who attacked Mr. Biden’s record on criminal justice and on housing policies that they argue devastated communities of color in places like that predominantly black city. “It is one of the honors of my life to be supported by a man who has put his life on the line for the last 50 years fighting for justice,” he told a largely white crowd of thousands gathered for an outdoor rally. “Everything that Jesse Jackson said is what this campaign is about.”Mr. Sanders has cast his two presidential campaigns in the lineage of Mr. Jackson’s 1988 presidential bid, telling advisers in 2015 that he hoped to model his 2016 operation after that effort.

"WASHINGTON — In a secure facility underneath the Capitol, members of Congress stopped by all last week to review two classified annexes to the Afghan peace accord with the Taliban that set the criteria for a critical element of the agreement: What constitutes enough “peace” for the United States to withdraw its forces?The Taliban have read the annexes.

While it may sound odd that the American military is sharing troop locations with its enemy of 18 years, the goal is to give the Taliban information that would allow it to prevent attacks during the withdrawal. Mr. Pompeo described the annexes last week as “military implementation documents.”That is part of it, but they appear to be much more.Because the documents lay out the specific understandings between the United States and the Taliban — including what bases would remain open under Afghan control — the details are critical to judging whether the United States is making good on its promise to leave only if conditions allow, or whether it is just getting out.The State Department has struggled to explain why the criteria for the terms, standards and thresholds for the American withdrawal could be known to the adversary but not to the American people or allies. In response to questions from The New York Times, the State Department issued a statement on Friday saying that the documents remained classified because “the movement of troops and operations against terrorists are sensitive matters.”“We do not want, for example, ISIS to know those details,” the statement added, referring to Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan.But another reason for the secrecy, according to several people familiar with the matter, is that the annexes leave the markers for peace remarkably vague, making it far from certain that the Taliban must convert into a counterterrorism force — as President Trump suggested a week ago — or that they are required to make complete peace with the elected government of President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan.

In fact, as written, they appear to give Mr. Trump, or his successor, enormous latitude to simply declare that the war is over and leave. But many of Mr. Trump’s aides suggest that American counterterrorism forces and a significant C.I.A. presence should remain in the country. How that will be resolved within the U.S. government, with the Taliban and with the Kabul government remains to be seen, and any resolution likely will prove difficult.

How that will be resolved within the U.S. government, with the Taliban and with the Kabul government remains to be seen, and any resolution likely will prove difficult. Many of the Republicans and Democrats who have taken the opportunity to review the documents say they are unimpressed.Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican and one of the sharpest critics of the accord, said before the agreement was signed last week, “Any deal that the United States would contemplate entering into with the Taliban should be made public in its entirety.”After reading the pact, including the classified annexes, Ms. Cheney said that the deal failed to provide mechanisms to verify that the Taliban was keeping the promises that Mr. Pompeo had described at the signing. “My concerns still remain,” she said, declining to describe the contents.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that the thresholds outlined in the annexes were “remarkably fuzzy” and that it was unclear how the United States would measure success.Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a senior State Department official in the Obama administration, posted a blistering message on Twitter last week about the annexes.

And it serves no national security purpose.”Lawmakers have voiced widespread unhappiness about Mr. Pompeo’s outreach on the subject. He called top members on the Senate and House committees dealing with foreign affairs last weekend to give them a cursory heads-up that the documents were coming to Congress, but lawmakers and their aides said they had not heard from him since.Days before the agreement was signed, Mr. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared to not know about — or seemed reluctant to discuss — the secret annexes.“Are you aware of any contemplation of any secret side deals with the Taliban?” Ms. Cheney asked on Feb. 26 during a House Armed Services Committee meeting.“Nothing, nothing comes to mind right now that you’re mentioning,” Mr. Esper replied.“You’re quoting things that I haven’t seen,” General Milley said.The annexes predominantly revolve around a committee to facilitate communication between the two parties to ensure commitments are being adhered to, according to officials who have read them. No details have come to light about the composition of that committee. “Bottom line: the administration is telling a terrorist group the conditions (such as they are) of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, but not telling the American people,” he wrote. “This is wrong.

They describe the parameters for when it would and would not be appropriate to use force, including commitments from the Taliban not to attack American forces during a withdrawal. Over all, the annexes make up no more than a few pages, often with just one to two sentences laying out each component. For example, the Taliban are not to conduct suicide attacks, and the Americans forgo drone strikes — portions of the agreements that thus far have held.

General Milley hinted in congressional testimony last week what scope and scale of attacks were not permitted under the agreement.“There is no attacks in 34 provincial capitals, there is no attacks in Kabul, there is no high-profile attacks, there is no suicide bombers, there is no vehicle-borne suicide, no attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition,” General Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, after reports that the Taliban had carried out attacks against Afghan security forces. “There is a whole laundry list of these things that aren’t happening.”In its statement, the State Department said the secret annexes were consistent with the public agreement. “The arrangements include specific commitments by all parties to efforts to continue to reduce violence until a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire is agreed in intra-Afghan negotiations, while preserving the right of all parties to self-defense,” it said. The United States has “a robust monitoring and verification mechanism” to track and assess the behavior of the Taliban, it added.But those who have seen the agreement said the specifics were so nebulous that they doubted the United States retained much leverage.“The documents provided none of the assurances that I felt like we heard from Secretary Pompeo and others about a rigorous process that was going to make sure we hold the Taliban accountable for their end of the deal,” said Representative Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, who served in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus.“I saw nothing in there that gives me any confidence” that those assurances are in place “beyond trusting the word of the Taliban,” he said. “This vague, thin package of documents is all we could actually get agreed to by the Taliban. I don’t really understand how we can say we have what we need to be able to commit to the troop level agreements that have been articulated.” General Milley hinted in congressional testimony last week what scope and scale of attacks were not permitted under the agreement.“There is no attacks in 34 provincial capitals, there is no attacks in Kabul, there is no high-profile attacks, there is no suicide bombers, there is no vehicle-borne suicide, no attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition,” General Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, after reports that the Taliban had carried out attacks against Afghan security forces. “There is a whole laundry list of these things that aren’t happening.”In its statement, the State Department said the secret annexes were consistent with the public agreement. “The arrangements include specific commitments by all parties to efforts to continue to reduce violence until a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire is agreed in intra-Afghan negotiations, while preserving the right of all parties to self-defense,” it said.

Moderate-leaning Democrats have rapidly coalesced behind Mr. Biden, whose campaign has been rolling out new endorsements seemingly nonstop in recent days.In a written statement about her endorsement, Ms. Harris noted the absence of a top female candidate in the primary. “Like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one,” she said, adding that “we find ourselves without any woman on a path to be the Democratic nominee for president.”“This is something we must reckon with and it is something I will have more to say about in the future,” Ms. Harris said. “But we must rise to unite the party and country behind a candidate who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who can ultimately defeat Donald Trump.”Ms. Harris announced her endorsement five days after Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden captured 10 of 14 states, and ahead of another round of contests on Tuesday in six states, including Michigan.

Mr. Sanders pointed on Sunday to Ms. Klobuchar’s and Mr. Buttigieg’s decisions to drop out as the reason he lost several key states to Mr. Biden on Super Tuesday. “The establishment put a great deal of pressure on Pete Buttigieg, on Amy Klobuchar, who ran really aggressive campaigns,” he told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If they had not withdrawn from the race before Super Tuesday, which is kind of a surprise to a lot of people, I suspect we would have won in Minnesota, we would have won in Maine, we would have won in Massachusetts.” For Ms. Harris, the decision to endorse Mr. Biden is particularly striking, because one of the biggest moments of her campaign was a forceful debate-stage exchange with him.“It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,” she said in June during the first Democratic debate.“And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,” she added. “And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.”The exchange gave her a lift in the polls and a temporary burst of momentum that she was not able to sustain. At a fund-raiser on Friday, Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, described Ms. Harris’s attack at the debate as a “punch to the gut.”Some of Ms. Harris’s advisers were privately frustrated that she endorsed Mr. Biden after California voted on Super Tuesday and when it was already clear that he had become the front-runner. Some were hoping in January that she would rally to Mr. Biden at a point when her endorsement would have been more valuable — and more politically daring.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump moved on Monday to address the economic effects of the widening coronavirus crisis by announcing that he would work with Congress on tax cuts and other measures after the worst stock market drop in more than a decade.The president, who played down the virus threat earlier in the day, made an unscheduled evening appearance in the White House briefing room after two Republican members of Congress who have spent time with him in recent days, including one who just rode with him on Air Force One, put themselves into quarantine following exposure to the virus.Also putting himself into isolation was Mark Meadows, the president’s newly designated White House chief of staff. Mr. Meadows, who was named to the role only on Friday and is stepping down from his House seat representing North Carolina, came into contact with the same infected attendee as the other two congressmen at a recent conservative political conference. While he tested negative for the coronavirus, his office said, he would remain quarantined until Wednesday out of caution.While none of the three men have displayed symptoms, the threat of the virus coming so close to the president represented a new stage of the outbreak even as organizations across the country restricted travel and canceled gatherings.

Mr. Trump made no mention of his own contacts with the affected lawmakers, but his spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, later said the president would not be tested “because he has neither had prolonged close contact” with confirmed patients “nor does he have any symptoms.” But clearly unsettled by the plunging markets and the potential effect on his re-election prospects, Mr. Trump offered an economic response without any new health measures.Speaking with reporters, he said he would meet on Tuesday with Republican congressional leaders to discuss a “very substantial” payroll tax cut and legislation to protect hourly wage earners who miss work because of the virus. He said he would also explore expanding loans by the Small Business Administration. He did not provide any details.“It’s not their fault,” he said of affected workers. “It’s not our country’s fault. This was something that we were thrown into and we’re going to handle it and we have been handling it very well.”He added, “The main thing is that we’re taking care of the American public and we will be taking care of the American public.”The developments came on one of the most jarring days of Mr. Trump’s presidency as markets plummeted, infections rose, schools and universities shut down classes and other nations imposed drastic travel restrictions. With individual lawmakers now heading into isolation, members of Congress contemplated whether it should recess altogether for the foreseeable future to guard against a further spread among the nation’s legislators.

With individual lawmakers now heading into isolation, members of Congress contemplated whether it should recess altogether for the foreseeable future to guard against a further spread among the nation’s legislators. The tension of the day was reflected on Air Force One as it made its way back to Washington from Florida. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, boarded the plane steps behind the president in Orlando, where Mr. Trump held a campaign fund-raiser, only to learn shortly after takeoff that he had been in contact with an infected person at a conservative conference late last month. He then essentially quarantined himself in the air, sitting alone in a compartment of the plane.
As the jet raced toward Washington, its television screens were tuned to Fox News showing the slow-motion progress of a cruise ship with 21 infected passengers heading to a port in Oakland, Calif., followed by overhead cameras under a “Virus Ship Watch” chyron, while a red box in the lower-left-hand corner showed the sinking Dow Jones industrial average, which finished the day down more than 2,000 points, or about 7 percent.Mr. Trump, who regularly invokes the market as an indicator of his success, on Twitter initially blamed the meltdown on falling oil prices and the news media even though most market analysts attributed the bulk of it to concern about the effect of the virus on the global economy. He made no mention of it when he met with reporters in the evening.He did praise his own decision last month to restrict entry to the United States by foreign citizens who had been to China in the previous 14 days.“The big decision was early when we shut down our borders,” he said, overstating the action he took. “We were the first ones ever to do that. We’ve never done that in our country before. We would have a situation that would be a lot more dire.”Mr. Trump has resisted canceling campaign rallies despite other large events being scrubbed, and a campaign aide said he would announce another one on Tuesday. But his campaign on Monday called off a “Women for Trump” bus tour featuring his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, and other top election surrogates, including Mercedes Schlapp, whose husband oversees the Conservative Political Action Conference, after which an attendee tested positive for the virus.That attendee came into contact with Mr. Meadows, Mr. Gaetz and at least three other Republican lawmakers who have now quarantined themselves. Mr. Gaetz, who attended events with Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on Friday and Saturday night, met up with the president again on Monday at the Orlando fund-raiser. Mr. Trump then invited Mr. Gaetz to join him on Air Force One back to Washington.In an interview, Mr. Gaetz said that he received a phone call from his chief of staff as the plane was taking off telling him that a picture had been found of him with the infected conference attendee 11 days earlier, meaning he had potentially been exposed to the virus. He said he told John McEntee, a top White House official, and asked to be separated from the other passengers.“He walked me back to a room toward the rear of Air Force One,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I went in there by myself.” A physician traveling with the president then came back and told him that because he had no symptoms 11 days later, he probably had not contracted the virus. But Mr. Gaetz said he remained apart from the rest of the passengers for the rest of the flight.As Air Force One was landing, Mr. Trump summoned him to the front of the plane. “I would not go into his office,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I stood outside of it. He just wanted to see if I was all right, which I am.”He said the president used humor to lighten the situation. “He asked if I needed to be wrapped in cellophane,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I told him that I was willing to jump out of the plane without a parachute if necessary.” He added that he was tested after landing and expects his results back on Tuesday.Mr. Gaetz drew attention last week when he wore a bulky gas mask in the Capitol for the vote on an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus. Days later, a resident of his Florida district died from the coronavirus, prompting some to suggest that he had made light of the risks. Mr. Gaetz denied that, saying he was making a serious point about the risk to lawmakers who interact with so many people. Mr. Gaetz, who attended events with Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on Friday and Saturday night, met up with the president again on Monday at the Orlando fund-raiser.

He said he told John McEntee, a top White House official, and asked to be separated from the other passengers.“He walked me back to a room toward the rear of Air Force One,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I went in there by myself.” A physician traveling with the president then came back and told him that because he had no symptoms 11 days later, he probably had not contracted the virus. But Mr. Gaetz said he remained apart from the rest of the passengers for the rest of the flight.As Air Force One was landing, Mr. Trump summoned him to the front of the plane. “I would not go into his office,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I stood outside of it. He just wanted to see if I was all right, which I am.”He said the president used humor to lighten the situation. “He asked if I needed to be wrapped in cellophane,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I told him that I was willing to jump out of the plane without a parachute if necessary.” He added that he was tested after landing and expects his results back on Tuesday.Mr. Gaetz drew attention last week when he wore a bulky gas mask in the Capitol for the vote on an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus. Days later, a resident of his Florida district died from the coronavirus, prompting some to suggest that he had made light of the risks. Mr. Gaetz denied that, saying he was making a serious point about the risk to lawmakers who interact with so many people. Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, who toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta with Mr. Trump on Friday, likewise went into isolation on Monday after being told by the C.D.C. that he too had been spotted in a photograph with the infected person at the conference.

Mr. Collins was on the tarmac when Mr. Trump landed in Atlanta on Friday and shook the president’s hand before joining him on the tour of the C.D.C. “While I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution,” Mr. Collins wrote on his Twitter feed.

Mr. Meadows was told over the weekend that he, too, might have come into contact with the infected attendee but tested negative, his congressional office said in a statement. “While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,” the statement said.Mr. Trump started Monday playing down the virus, reminding Americans that tens of thousands of people die of the ordinary flu every year. “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,” he wrote on Twitter. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”He dismissed the effect of the outbreak in fueling Monday’s market meltdown. “Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,” he wrote. “That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!” Mr. Meadows was told over the weekend that he, too, might have come into contact with the infected attendee but tested negative, his congressional office said in a statement. “While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,” the statement said.Mr. Trump started Monday playing down the virus, reminding Americans that tens of thousands of people die of the ordinary flu every year. “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,” he wrote on Twitter. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths.

Senior officials engaged in spirited talks last week about whether to warn older Americans against traveling on cruise ships or to go even further than that.As those discussions intensified, at least eight members of the administration’s coronavirus task force, including those with medical backgrounds as well as cabinet officials like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, recommended sending the cruise notice.But two senior White House officials — Joe Grogan, the head of the Domestic Policy Council, and Larry Kudlow, the president’s national economic adviser — argued that they should consider the effects of such a move on 150,000 jobs in Florida, where the tourism industry could be particularly hard hit, according to two senior administration officials. Ultimately, the proponents of a notice won out and the State Department posted it on its website on Sunday.

"BAY CITY, Mich. — When the United Auto Workers went on strike against General Motors last fall, Robby Lamas and those left at the massive engine plant in this Michigan city walked the picket lines day and night. Mr. Lamas, who, at 30, was the youngest at the plant by a decade, was unsure how the public would react to the walkout, his first strike.After all, employment at the plant is now a fraction of what it once was. And not far from anyone’s mind was the fact that Bay County flipped to Republican in 2016, against the wishes of the U.A.W. The county was one of 12 former Democratic strongholds in Michigan that delivered parts of the once impregnable industrial Midwest to Donald J. Trump.Almost four years later, Bay City, the county seat, still has the feel of a traditional labor town. For the 40 days of the GM strike, nearly every car that passed the strikers honked. A steady stream of residents and businesses kept dropping off food, firewood, tents and other supplies. “People were donating stuff all the way to the end,” Mr. Lamas said.But fissures are never far from the surface. Mr. Lamas and some other workers were infuriated that President Trump did not offer support for the strikers. The union instructed them not to talk politics on the picket line, especially after a scuffle broke out between fellow strikers when one of them showed up carrying a Trump 2020 flag.

The union instructed them not to talk politics on the picket line, especially after a scuffle broke out between fellow strikers when one of them showed up carrying a Trump 2020 flag. The strike, the longest national walkout against GM since 1970, symbolized the contradictions and tensions in places like Bay City as Michigan prepares to vote on Tuesday, one of six states holding primaries or caucuses.Mr. Trump often touts a “blue-collar boom.” But there is a sense that residents in Bay County are barely hanging on. The poverty rate increased to almost 15 percent in 2017 from under 10 percent in 1999. Real median earnings for men working full-time and year-round fell about $7,000 in that time, as an ecosystem of factories that held up the Midwest was hollowed out, said Gabriel Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan’s Research Seminar in Qualitative Economics. The plant where Mr. Lamas works now employs fewer than 400 workers, down from nearly 5,000 at its peak.

Barreling down I-75, the north-south expressway that runs from the northern tip of Michigan to Florida, many drivers barely notice Bay City. Anchoring a flat landscape of factories and farms north of Detroit and Flint, this small, unassuming city is perhaps best known for being Madonna’s hometown.It happens to be my hometown as well.I graduated in 1984 from Garber High School, about three miles from the GM plant. Back then, mid-Michigan was just emerging from a recession so severe that some parents of my high school classmates lost their jobs.

Back then, mid-Michigan was just emerging from a recession so severe that some parents of my high school classmates lost their jobs.  Michigan came back then and, like the auto industry, has a history of booms and busts — and surprises. Political observers thought Michigan was a lock for the Democrats in 2016 because it had leaned that way in six previous presidential cycles and because President Barack Obama defied Republicans and bailed out GM and Chrysler during the financial crisis. Many still profess shock that the state went Republican instead. Even nearby Saginaw County, where more than 42 percent of residents are African-Americans, went for Mr. Trump.As the political stakes rise for Michigan, I found myself drawn to my hometown for signals about how 2020 will unfold.In a polarized nation, places like Bay City do not fall into a neat script. Democrats tend to favor gun rights and oppose abortion, which leaves them feeling out of step with the national party. Though young people like Mr. Lamas tend to be strong supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, others prefer former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., worried that a far-left candidate would not fare well in the general election.“This isn’t Ann Arbor or Lansing,” said Jim Barcia, referring to the state’s most liberal college towns. Mr. Barcia, a Democrat, was pressed back into service as Bay County’s county executive in 2016 after retiring after five terms in the House of Representatives.Not long ago, he watched as more than 100 angry residents crowded a meeting demanding that Bay County be declared a “Second Amendment sanctuary” amid talk of an assault weapons ban. “One 70-year-old lady had tears in her eyes,” recalled Mr. Barcia, an avid hunter who has two bucks mounted on his office wall.Asked how Bay City is doing these days, Mr. Barcia, a lifelong resident, points to the 1993 passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and a most favored nation trade pact with China. He estimates that Bay County has lost 7,500 jobs since 2000, almost a tenth of its population.“Much of what we feared ended up happening. I saw our manufacturers disappear,” said Mr. Barcia, who voted against both while in the House. “When Trump talked about trade, it really did resonate with working families.” Michigan came back then and, like the auto industry, has a history of booms and busts — and surprises.

Of the five most common occupations in Bay County, only one — a registered nurse — averages more than $25,000 a year. Manufacturing does not make the top five.“I don’t know anyone who isn’t working two or three jobs or has a side gig,” said Kim Coonan, the owner of Coonan’s Irish Hub, a neighborhood restaurant and bar down the street from the GM Powertrain plant, a backbone of the city since it began making parts for Chevrolet in 1916. “The middle class is gone.”Recently, there has been talk of more layoffs. Most of the stores in the Bay City mall have shuttered. Downtown is dotted with empty storefronts, between restaurants and condominiums that reflect budding efforts to remake the riverfront city into a destination.There are not a lot of Trump signs or MAGA hats visible here. Yet there is evidence of a quiet support for Mr. Trump for being willing to take on China, even if the results have been mixed. Support for labor runs so deep that what is expressed behind closed doors is often different than what is said in public, making political opinion hard to gauge. “People wear masks here,” said one business executive, who asked not to be identified by name.One exception to this rule: the area’s farmers, who are proudly supportive of the president. “In my group of friends, I don’t know anyone who won’t support Trump,” said Brian Johnson, who this year took over the family farm in Pinconning, north of Bay City. He received $80,000 in federal compensation from lost sales in soybeans to China last year, an amount he said prevented him from a financial disaster.

Uncertain still is which politician gets blamed for that and who benefits. “I don’t know what way it’s going to go this time,” Mr. Bulls said.

Perhaps the biggest one is college.“It’s flipped,” Mr. Harris said.“Until eight to 10 years ago, 60 percent went to a four-year college,” Mr. Harris said. “Now 60 percent go to community college instead.”The biggest reason, he says, is the cost. Michigan has a strong system of state universities. But with tuition and living expenses between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, attending a four-year college is simply not an option for many families.“I get out my phone and start showing them the figures. I tell them, ‘This is the amount of money you will owe,’” Mr. Harris said. “Somebody is going to go into debt. Some of them are shocked.”More than half of the 129 members of the class of 2019 are attending Delta College, a community college where many qualify for aid. Fewer than one-third are attending four-year colleges — and only a small handful are at the state’s top universities. On his bulletin board, Mr. Harris has a sticker touting the University of Michigan’s tuition guarantee for qualified students whose parents make under $60,000.

On a recent day, he called in one of the high school’s high-achieving juniors to talk about possibilities, including the University of Michigan scholarship. “Do you know how much your parents make?” Mr. Harris asked Jessica Albrecht, who is 17. She told him that her father is a truck driver, and her mother works in the school district.“I’m smart here, but I’m not sure I would be there,” Ms. Albrecht said of the possibility of the University of Michigan. Still, she seemed intrigued. If her parents’ combined income is under $60,000, Michigan could be a real option, Mr. Harris told her. If not, he said, pausing, as he tried to balance encouragement with reality, it is tougher.For years, young people in this area did not feel a lot of pressure to go to college. They could graduate and get a job at “the shop.” The U.A.W.-negotiated salary was a gateway to a middle-class life that supported places like Bay County, allowing people to marry, have a family, buy a house and, if they could eke out 20 years of service, even own a home or a boat “up north.”“You could have a very nice life,” Mr. Harris, who grew up in Bay City, recalled.Racing from one job to the nextThere is hardly a better place to watch today’s job shuffle than Coonan’s, where office workers, teachers, mechanics and others come to work extra hours as a second, third, even fourth job.The unemployment rate in Bay City is 4.7 percent, but that masks the fact that many jobs simply pay too little to make ends meet.Erin Sitkowski works as an account manager at the F.P.

He dropped out after a year because he was $40,000 in debt.Like many at the plant, he comes from an auto family. His father works in the same engine plant.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s campaign manager and a circle of allies have seized control of the Republican Party’s voter data and fund-raising apparatus, using a network of private businesses whose operations and ownership are cloaked in secrecy, largely exempt from federal disclosure.Working under the aegis of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, with the cooperation of Trump appointees at the Republican National Committee, the operatives have consolidated power — and made money — in a way not possible in an earlier, more transparent analog era. Since 2017, businesses associated with the group have billed roughly $75 million to the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and a range of other Republican clients.The takeover of the Republican Party’s under-the-hood political machinery parallels the president’s domination of a party that once shunned him, reflected in his speedy impeachment trial and summary acquittal. Elected Republicans have learned the political peril of insufficient fealty. Now, by commanding the party’s repository of voter data and creating a powerful pipeline for small donations, the Trump campaign and key party officials have made it increasingly difficult for Republicans to mount modern, digital campaigns without the president’s support.The process has not been exactly frictionless, shot through with accusations of empire-building and profiteering by the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and his allies. Mr. Parscale’s flagship firm, Parscale Strategy, has billed nearly $35 million to the Trump campaign, the R.N.C. and related entities since 2017 — the vast bulk of it, he says, passed along to advertising and digital firms.

What’s more, the move to consolidate voter data came at the expense of a competing data vehicle developed by the conservative activist Koch brothers, provoking resentment from Koch allies, especially in the Senate. And a fierce pressure campaign to centralize fund-raising on the new platform, a for-profit company that Mr. Trump branded WinRed, brought dissent from candidates initially reluctant to sign on, as well as competitors who believed they were being pushed aside without a fair hearing.For all that, WinRed, created last summer, has given the party an overdue counterweight to ActBlue, the Democrats’ small-donor fund-raising juggernaut. With WinRed, donors could contribute with a few clicks, and candidates could reap windfalls through joint appeals with the president. In its first six months, capitalizing on the Republican base’s outrage over impeachment, WinRed raised $100 million, a fast start, though still well behind the roughly $1 billion raised last year by ActBlue.

The Parscale-led group — including Katie Walsh Shields and her husband, Mike Shields, both former R.N.C. chiefs of staff; and the party’s former digital director, Gerrit Lansing — has also presided over the creation of a number of other political tools, from the president’s affiliated super PACs to a forthcoming party-controlled news app intended to produce cheerleading content.Mr. Parscale declined to comment in detail for this article.

A Data Arms RaceIn the aftermath of Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 presidential run, the Republican Party released a 100-page report that many considered an autopsy. Reince Priebus, then the R.N.C. chairman, offered this blunt assessment: “Our message was weak. Our ground game was insufficient. We weren’t inclusive.

Reince Priebus, then the R.N.C. chairman, offered this blunt assessment: “Our message was weak. Our ground game was insufficient. We weren’t inclusive. We were behind in both data and digital.” While Mr. Trump’s team shredded its core recommendation — a tolerant immigration policy and outreach to women and minorities — it embraced the call for technological change.Previously, parties had spent heavily on television advertising, but now the R.N.C. moved to rebuild around Data Trust, which it had recently helped establish. The idea was compelling: If state and national party committees and campaigns fed information into one place, it could create a deeper understanding of voters. If that place were outside the party, fund-raising limits would not apply. Contractors were fired, and much of the R.N.C.’s data staff was moved into Data Trust, which effectively became an off-campus arm of the party.“Naturally we faced opposition from a lot of the entrenched interests who had business models that benefited from the old way of doing things,” said Mr. Shields, the R.N.C. chief of staff in 2013 and 2014.That included the Koch brothers and their data vehicle, i360, which built personality profiles of millions of voters and was used by a number of campaigns. They weren’t the only skeptics who worried that the committee was steering business to its pet company. Aides to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, believed that Data Trust was inferior to its competitor, and Mr. McConnell gave senators the option of using either.The battle came to a head in mid-2016, when Mr. Priebus and Ms. Walsh-Shields, who had become R.N.C. chief of staff the previous year, visited the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She accused the committee of working against the interests of the party and its presumptive presidential nominee, Mr. Trump. From there, the meeting devolved into shouting, several Republicans with direct knowledge of the clash said.While Ms. Walsh-Shields said in a statement that she did not recall the specific meeting, she added: “I have found that quite often when a woman in a position of power disagrees with a man, it is later referred to as a bad meeting.” While Mr. Trump’s team shredded its core recommendation — a tolerant immigration policy and outreach to women and minorities — it embraced the call for technological change.Previously, parties had spent heavily on television advertising, but now the R.N.C. moved to rebuild around Data Trust, which it had recently helped establish.

Republicans had fund-raising tools, but by coalescing around a single vendor like ActBlue, candidates could raise money jointly and more easily share data on contributors. There were several contenders. But to Mr. Kushner and Mr. Parscale, who by then was the 2020 campaign manager, only one vendor was acceptable, according to several people with knowledge of the deliberations: a company called Revv which had already been processing payments for the campaign.

Revv had been co-founded by Mr. Lansing, who was well regarded as a tech-savvy operator and for raising alarms about ActBlue for years. But in 2017, Politico reported that,  after taking over as the R.N.C.’s digital director the year before, he had encouraged Republican campaigns to use Revv, earning a $909,000 payout from the company. Some party veterans viewed this as self-dealing.By the summer of 2019, WinRed was created atop Revv’s platform, but only after negotiations that ended with the Senate campaign committee, and R.N.C. representatives, imposing restrictions that blocked Mr. Lansing from selling WinRed in the future and tightening control of firms he could hire.Mr. Lansing, in a statement, called WinRed “the work of seven months of lawyering to ensure every major stakeholder would be happy with all data, financial and ownership arrangements.”The new company was a joint venture between Revv and Data Trust, with 60 percent of profits going to Revv. (WinRed charges campaigns 3.8 percent, plus 30 cents per credit card transaction.) Officials involved would not detail Mr. Lansing’s remuneration. Mr. Parscale, Ms. Walsh-Shields and Mr. Shields do not own stakes, according to financial records reviewed by The New York Times.WinRed became ascendant, and this time the Trump team and Senate Republicans joined in a pressure campaign to convert holdouts. Mr. McConnell told colleagues at a lunch in mid-2019 that his personal goal was to “shut down all the competitors,” according to one senator who was surprised at the majority leader’s directness.

With or without a stake in WinRed, key aides have positioned themselves at the center of a formidable political machine.

Mr. Shields’s firm, Convergence Media, represents clients ranging from the National Republican Congressional Committee to Representative Devin Nunes of California, one of the president’s staunchest defenders against impeachment.But it is Mr. Parscale who has most often been the focus of Mr. Trump’s complaints that those around him are making too much money from his name and brand. Mr. Parscale has not always discouraged suspicions. A few weeks before the 2016 election, the campaign staff gathered at the Whiskey Trader, a watering hole near Trump Tower, to play beer pong and brace for near-certain defeat. In walked Mr. Parscale, returning from dinner with a new campaign hire.“I’m making so much money!” Mr. Parscale declared, inserting an expletive, according to two people who were present.Mr. Parscale, in a statement, called their account “untrue and ridiculous,” but since his appointment as campaign manager, he has bought a $2.4 million canalside home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; two condos, owned with his family, together worth $2 million; and a Ferrari. A campaign official attributed the spending to Mr. Parscale’s relocation and divestment from businesses in Texas.But after a rival aide left an underlined copy of a Daily Mail story detailing his spending on the president’s desk, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Parscale for a pointed lecture, according to a senior White House official.Others in his circle have made purchases of their own. Mr. Lansing bought a $1.7 million home in Washington last year, while Ms. Walsh-Shields and Mr. Shields bought a $2 million beach house in the Florida panhandle. Asked about the house, Ms. Walsh-Shields referred a reporter to her mother, who said the down payment and mortgage payments had come mostly from her. Mr. Shields had also recently sold the house he owned before their marriage.That Ms. Walsh-Shields has endured is noteworthy. While Vice President Mike Pence said, in a statement, that “we are grateful for her hard work, loyalty and professionalism,” Mr. Trump has privately referred to her as a ‘leaker,’ blaming her for unflattering media coverage during her brief tenure as White House deputy chief of staff in 2017. He has pressed Ronna McDaniel, the party chairwoman, about Ms. Walsh-Shields’s role in recent days. And during a meeting last summer, after prodding by his longtime security consultant, Keith Schiller, the president asked if Ms. McDaniel trusted her, according to people with knowledge of the exchanges. “I do,” Ms. McDaniel replied. “She works for me.” With or without a stake in WinRed, key aides have positioned themselves at the center of a formidable political machine.

A company called Excelsior Strategies, run by employees at Mr. Shields’s firm, Convergence, was contracted to rent Mr. Trump’s crown jewel, his list of some 20 million donors; Mr. Shields said that only the campaign profited from the arrangement. And Opn Sesame, a start-up run by Gary Coby, a Parscale protégé, is being paid $200,000 to $300,000 a month through the R.N.C., according to campaign filings.When the Trump campaign’s digital operation recently moved to its own floor at the campaign’s Northern Virginia headquarters, much of it was being run by Mr. Coby, who recently merged his operations with the R.N.C.’s data team. Opn Sesame’s specialty is texting voters, a burgeoning and lightly regulated field that is expected to be a factor in the 2020 campaign.To allay Mr. Trump’s concerns, tens of millions of dollars worth of campaign advertising that once ran through Parscale Strategy has been redirected to a new company, American Made Media, which is run by a Parscale lieutenant. There are no public records detailing the company’s financial structure; Mr. Parscale and other advisers said they did not profit from it. Mr. Parscale has declined to provide detailed accounting of his  network of interlocking businesses, and has told associates he follows Mr. Trump’s directive, relayed through Ms. McDaniel, that he make no more than $700,000 or $800,000 for his campaign work.Even to insiders, the campaign’s activities can seem opaque.Last fall, Mr. Pence’s office scheduled his first visit to the headquarters, to get a firsthand look. But when the day came, Mr. Parscale canceled, even though the visit was already on the vice president’s official schedule. Mr. Parscale, who spends much of his time working from his Florida home — though he recently said he would relocate to Washington — told Mr. Pence’s office that the campaign’s landlord had vetoed the idea, fearing a vice-presidential visit would disrupt other tenants. Mr. Pence was puzzled not to learn sooner, and the visit has not been rescheduled, two officials with knowledge of the episode said.For the moment, such concerns are muted as the Trump campaign, the R.N.C. and other affiliated committees raised $155 million in the final three months of 2019, a 23 percent increase over the previous quarter that was buoyed by the impeachment proceedings. The digital operation overseen by Mr. Coby and Mr. Parscale has been developing a series of new products, including a news app for volunteers to dole out Trump-friendly content, republish Trump-world tweets and raffle MAGA hats. An arm of the campaign has also hired a company called Phunware, which specializes in tracking cellphone locations; a senior campaign official said the company was hired to develop an app, not track people.The Democrats are trying to regroup, but their efforts have been scattershot. A year ago, the party installed its former chairman, Howard Dean, to create a Data Trust for the left, but the momentum around the venture has lagged. A company called Excelsior Strategies, run by employees at Mr. Shields’s firm, Convergence, was contracted to rent Mr. Trump’s crown jewel, his list of some 20 million donors; Mr. Shields said that only the campaign profited from the arrangement. And Opn Sesame, a start-up run by Gary Coby, a Parscale protégé, is being paid $200,000 to $300,000 a month through the R.N.C., according to campaign filings.When the Trump campaign’s digital operation recently moved to its own floor at the campaign’s Northern Virginia headquarters, much of it was being run by Mr. Coby, who recently merged his operations with the R.N.C.’s data team.

"DEARBORN, Mich. — The second highest, hardest glass ceiling is pretty good too, right?With the Democratic presidential nominee all but certain to be a man, party activists, elected officials and voters are setting their sights on the biggest consolation prize in American politics: the vice presidency.Within hours of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the race, a departure that left the party facing a primary battle between two septuagenarian white men, prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.At least one women’s organization, Supermajority, circulated a petition asking both Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to “affirm their commitment to gender equity” by choosing a woman as their running mate. On Sunday, as he endorsed Mr. Sanders before thousands at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., the Rev. Jesse Jackson called for the next president to pick a black woman as vice president.“There must be a woman on this ticket,” said Cecile Richards, a longtime abortion rights activist and a founder of Supermajority. “What is really important to see is representation, a commitment to the issues that women care about and a commitment to do something about it.” DEARBORN, Mich. — The second highest, hardest glass ceiling is pretty good too, right?With the Democratic presidential nominee all but certain to be a man, party activists, elected officials and voters are setting their sights on the biggest consolation prize in American politics: the vice presidency.Within hours of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the race, a departure that left the party facing a primary battle between two septuagenarian white men, prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.At least one women’s organization, Supermajority, circulated a petition asking both Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R.

They’re unlikely to face much opposition from the candidates: Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say they are considering multiple women for the position.The calls for a female vice president have intensified as the primary has essentially narrowed to a two-man race. Hillary Clinton said she would “love” to see a woman on the ticket but, in an interview with CNN, urged the future nominee to “take a really hard look at the Electoral College for what will help him.”On Sunday, Ms. Harris of California endorsed Mr. Biden, heightening speculation that she could be selected as his running mate. Despite a bitter competition, Mr. Biden remains fond of Ms. Harris, in part because she was friends with his late son Beau Biden when they both served as state attorneys general.“I believe in Joe,” she said in a video posted on Twitter. “I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time.” The selection of a female vice president, particularly one of color, would offer a fitting coda to a presidential primary where racial and gender representation has taken second place to concerns about defeating President Trump.Even when the female candidates were still in the race, people at town hall meetings and campaign rallies often suggested Ms. Warren or Senator Kamala Harris as possible No. 2s on a ticket, as a way of providing a dose of history-making enthusiasm without what many voters viewed as the risk of having a woman lead the ticket.

The former second lady described Ms. Harris’s debate-stage attacks on Mr. Biden’s record on race as a “punch to the gut.” She offered more praise for Senator Amy Klobuchar, who endorsed Mr. Biden last week, calling her “an incredible woman.” His wife expressed a slightly less glowing view of the California senator.At a Friday fund-raiser in the Chicago suburbs, a largely female audience shouted suggestions for vice-presidential nominees to Jill Biden, with many arguing the pick should be a woman.

While academics, activists and officials seeking to promote women in politics embrace the idea that a qualified woman could become vice president, some also cringe at being encouraged to settle for silver after spending a year competing hard for the gold.“In the current political environment, it looks tone deaf to have an all-white, all-male ticket,” said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on women in politics. “There’s no question that the notion of a female V.P. is used as a strategy and I think that’s a little bit sexist. It’s sort of like an ‘insert woman here’ kind of conversation.”People close to both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say their campaigns see strong political arguments for putting a woman on the ticket, believing such a choice could generate enthusiasm from female voters who make up the backbone of the party and sharpen their contrast with Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen women.Women remain Mr. Trump’s staunchest opponents, with large majorities consistently giving him some of the lowest marks in polling. His presidency has inspired the largest gender gap in history and supercharged turnout among female Democrats.

Only two have been nominated: Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska by the Republican Party in 2008 and Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro by Democrats in 1984.Putting a woman on the ticket could also move the country closer to electing a first female president. If elected, the female vice president could later find herself in a stronger position to win the presidency than any woman in American history.A vocal segment of the party argues that the vice-presidential slot must go not just to any woman but specifically to a black woman, given the crucial support African-American women have given to the Democrats in recent elections. Over the past three years, the overwhelming backing of black women helped the party recapture control of the House and flip Senate and governor’s seats in deep-red states like Louisiana and Alabama.“African-American women have been the most loyal supporters of Democratic candidates,” said Representative Barbara Lee of California, a former chairwoman of Ms. Harris’s campaign. “It’s time we have an African-American woman as vice president.”Nikema Williams, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Georgia, put it simply: “A black woman on the ticket is the margin of victory.”Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic Senate leader, is particularly focused on the idea, arguing that such a pick could help unite the party after a divisive primary, according to people who have spoken with Mr. Schumer.

Mr. Schumer isn’t the only party official intrigued by the idea of putting a black woman on the ticket.

Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan as a national co-chair of his campaign. Other names that have been floated by Mr. Biden or those around him include Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader who narrowly lost a race for governor last year; Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general who became a Democratic icon after being fired by Mr. Trump early in his term; Ms. Klobuchar; and Senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, is seeking a woman who agrees with his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.” With many of his top female surrogates, including Representatives Ilhan Omar, Pramila Jayapal and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, disqualified from seeking the presidency because of their age or foreign birthplace, Ms. Warren is one of a few elected officials who fit the criteria, according to some close to the Sanders campaign.Following in the long tradition of possible vice-presidential picks, the women in the midst of all the chatter have largely declined to comment on whether they’ve been approached about the job. Ms. Whitmer said that she raised the issue of representation with Mr. Biden and planned to participate in all aspects of the campaign — including vetting possible running mates.

While little academic research has been done on female vice presidents, there’s plenty of data from business and economics that suggests women are more likely to be overlooked for chief executive positions and other top jobs. As in politics, it’s harder for assertive, ambitious women to be seen as likable, and easier to conclude they lack some intangible, ill-defined quality of leadership, the data shows.Yet there’s also little evidence that vice presidents — male or female — have a significant impact on converting undecided voters, despite all the thought campaigns put into selecting presidential running mates. Studies of the 2008 race found that while Ms. Palin shored up her party’s evangelical base, she did little to help John McCain, the Republican nominee, win over independent or Democratic-leaning women.“The research on the importance of the vice president is pretty compelling in that there’s a lot of strategy that goes into the pick and not a lot of evidence that it matters,” Dr. Lawless said.For months, both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have indicated that they are likely to select a female candidate. In February, Mr. Sanders said his campaign would select someone “maybe not of the same gender that I am.”During a town hall event in November, Mr. Biden floated four possible vice-presidential picks. All were women. He has also said both Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris would be on his list of potential picks.Last spring, weeks before Mr. Biden announced his bid, his advisers discussed naming either Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris to the ticket early, perhaps even before he captured the nomination. The unusual move was considered as a way to build enthusiasm and reassure voters about his age.A few weeks later, Ms. Harris pushed back, noting that Mr. Biden, in turn, would be an asset as the No. 2 on the ticket: “As vice president, he’s shown he can do the job.”Lisa Lerer reported from Dearborn, Mich., and Reid J.

His sudden, steep cut to the price of oil has rocked a global economy already at risk of falling into recession, threatened to burn through Saudi Arabia’s cash reserves and undermined his grandiose promises of new investments to lessen the kingdom’s dependence on oil.

The next day he plunged Saudi Arabia into a price war with Russia that sent energy and stock markets around the world into free fall.For a while, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia had appeared to be living down his reputation for dangerous aggression.Perhaps chastened by the blowback over his connection with the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the 34-year-old crown prince had kept a low profile for more than a year.Now his new power plays are reviving debates in Western capitals about whether he is too rash to trust as a partner. His sudden, steep cut to the price of oil has rocked a global economy already at risk of falling into recession, threatened to burn through Saudi Arabia’s cash reserves and undermined his grandiose promises of new investments to lessen the kingdom’s dependence on oil. “It is mutually assured destruction for any oil exporting economy, certainly including Saudi Arabia and Russia and probably the United States as well,” said Greg Brew, a scholar of the region and a fellow at Southern Methodist University.“But this is typical MBS, right?” he added, referring to the crown prince by his initials. “He is a risk taker, and he is prone to impulsive decisions.”The detention of the senior royals, which began to leak out on Friday, has not been acknowledged or explained by the Saudi officials.Two of the detained princes — Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of the crown prince’s aging father, King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister — had once been seen as possible rivals for power. Their arrests stirred anxious speculation among cowed members of the royal family that Crown Prince Mohammed might be sidelining opponents in preparation for taking the throne from his father, who is 84 and has sometimes appeared forgetful or disoriented. “It is mutually assured destruction for any oil exporting economy, certainly including Saudi Arabia and Russia and probably the United States as well,” said Greg Brew, a scholar of the region and a fellow at Southern Methodist University.“But this is typical MBS, right?” he added, referring to the crown prince by his initials. “He is a risk taker, and he is prone to impulsive decisions.”The detention of the senior royals, which began to leak out on Friday, has not been acknowledged or explained by the Saudi officials.Two of the detained princes — Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of the crown prince’s aging father, King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister — had once been seen as possible rivals for power.

He wanted to teach the rest of the family a lesson. “It was quiet for a while and people were wondering if MBS had mellowed,” Steffen Hertog, a scholar at the London School of Economics, said. “But clearly his character is pretty persistent.”Prince Mohammed slashed the oil price to punish Russia, which he faulted for failing to cooperate in cutting production and propping up prices. The slowdown caused by the coronavirus was already reducing demand for oil.“The Russians called their bluff, and now the Saudis are trying to demonstrate to the Russians what the cost is of a lack of cooperation,” Professor Hertog said. But for Saudi Arabia, “it is a risky game of chicken.”Saudi Arabia has much more to lose than Russia. Russia has more diverse sources of revenue and it has built up its reserves since the last oil price downturn.Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, remains overwhelmingly dependent on oil. What’s more, its cash reserves have remained flat for about four years at around $500 billion, down from a peak of about $740 billion in the summer of 2014.Analysts say that the kingdom needs a so-called break-even price of about $80 a barrel to meet its budget without either further drawing down those reserves or adopting painful austerity measures. But the price on Monday fell to about $35 a barrel, less than half the break-even price. “It was quiet for a while and people were wondering if MBS had mellowed,” Steffen Hertog, a scholar at the London School of Economics, said. “But clearly his character is pretty persistent.”Prince Mohammed slashed the oil price to punish Russia, which he faulted for failing to cooperate in cutting production and propping up prices.

But the price on Monday fell to about $35 a barrel, less than half the break-even price. A downturn of as much as two years could cut into those reserves severely enough to put pressure on the Saudi exchange rate as well as the plans to diversify the economy, Professor Hertog said.The crown prince’s economic plan for the country centered on a public offering of shares in the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, to raise money to invest in other sectors. But plans for a debut on a major international market were pulled in favor of the more lax Saudi domestic exchange, and over the last two days the oil price cut has sent shares tumbling by 20 percent, shaving $320 billion off the value of the company.The timing of the price war so soon after the roundup of his royal relatives on Friday has aroused speculation that the crown prince sought to contain potential opponents in anticipation of trouble. Perhaps he wanted to pre-empt any foes before economic pain from the downturn made him politically vulnerable, some suggested.“The threat to MBS is not coming from his royal rivals,” argued Kristin Smith Diwan, a scholar at the Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It is coming from the collapse in oil revenues and what that does to his ambitious economic plans.”But other analysts, former diplomats and officials with experience in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis close to the royal court said that Prince Mohammed had consolidated power so thoroughly that he had little left to fear.With a level of ruthlessness unprecedented in modern Saudi history, the crown prince has seized more direct power over the kingdom than any monarch in decades, largely by intimidating into submission his own sprawling ruling family. Even in a severe downturn, the members of the royal family he detained had little hope of challenging him.

He had already put the same royals under tight surveillance, limiting their ability to plot against him, according to people close to the royal court.A spokesman for the Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.The most senior figure detained, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, more than 70 years old, had once been recorded in London making comments distancing himself from the crown prince’s policies but had since appeared submissive, at least in public.The other prominent royal detained, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, had already been under house arrest since 2017, when he was removed from his posts as crown prince and interior minister by the current crown prince.Previous Saudi rulers might have provided some advance warning to Washington and London before such high profile detentions, former diplomats said. Crown Prince Mohammed had met in Riyadh last week with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab of Britain and last month with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Yet the crown prince gave no indication that the arrests were imminent, according to diplomats and other officials with knowledge of the matter.

He even temporarily kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and forced him to announce a resignation (which the prime minister later retracted).American intelligence agencies concluded that in 2018 Prince Mohammed ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist who lived in Virginia.Since then, some analysts have seen signs of maturation, in particular his pulling back from a potential armed clash with his nemesis, Iran, last year.

Even as Mr. Biden is heading a bandwagon with former 2020 rivals and moderate Democratic voters clambering aboard, Mr. Sanders has a loyal base that is emotionally bound to him, an attachment rooted in their own economic struggles and lived experiences, rather than triangulating the most electable candidate.Tuesday’s primary contests, in six states including Missouri and Washington, are unfolding against a backdrop of high anxiety over the economic and health consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. For most Sanders voters, plummeting stock prices matter less than the broader injustices he champions around wage inequality, health care and student loan debt.If Mr. Sanders defies expectations in Michigan, a state he won in the 2016 primary, it will be because his all-out efforts here over the last four days succeeded in broadening his support, reversing the demographic trends that broke against him on Super Tuesday.

Jesse Jackson, the two-time presidential candidate, endorsed him, and over 10,000 in Ann Arbor, where he was introduced by America’s second most popular democratic socialist, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.“In order for us to win we have to grow, we must be inclusive, we must bring more people into this movement,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.One possible sign of progress in widening his coalition is that former supporters of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week but has yet to make an endorsement, were not hard to find in the Sanders multitudes.

Winning those voters again not just in Michigan but in Ohio and Illinois, which vote on March 17, undergirds Mr. Sanders’s hope for a comeback.His TV ads and his speeches hammer Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement, reviled by many factory workers, and for past statements suggesting an openness to cutting Social Security.

And as the race moves to Michigan, Florida, Illinois and other delegate-rich, diverse states, it’s becoming even clearer that Mr. Sanders’s failure to win significant support with black voters could end up dooming his second primary bid.As I traveled with the Sanders campaign across Michigan this past weekend, he drew huge crowds, as he often does. But they were overwhelmingly white.Those demographics were stark in a state where black voters are expected to make up nearly a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate on Tuesday.Clearly, the Sanders campaign wants to expand beyond its base. At seven rallies over three days, it showcased a diverse array of supporters, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the celebrity academic Cornel West.In Grand Rapids, Mr. Sanders accepted the endorsement of a man he called “one of the true heroes of modern America,” the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Like Mr. Sanders hopes to do, Mr. Jackson used a surprise victory in Michigan to buoy his 1988 presidential bid.

But they were overwhelmingly white.Those demographics were stark in a state where black voters are expected to make up nearly a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate on Tuesday.Clearly, the Sanders campaign wants to expand beyond its base. At seven rallies over three days, it showcased a diverse array of supporters, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the celebrity academic Cornel West.In Grand Rapids, Mr. Sanders accepted the endorsement of a man he called “one of the true heroes of modern America,” the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Like Mr. Sanders hopes to do, Mr. Jackson used a surprise victory in Michigan to buoy his 1988 presidential bid. (Fun deep cut: In the Vermont caucuses that year, Mr. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was “slapped by an irate citizen after casting his vote” for Mr. Jackson.)Yet, at a town-hall meeting in Flint, billed as an opportunity for Mr. Sanders to make a case directly to black voters, the Vermont senator refused to discuss issues of particular concern to black Americans. Instead, before yet another overwhelmingly white audience, he ceded the stage to African-American surrogates who delivered a series of searing attacks on Mr. Biden’s record.His campaign said Mr. Sanders had scrapped his speech in order to “lift up” the voices of the black panelists.“Bernie does not have those experiences,” a campaign spokesman said. “He’s a white Jewish man.”Presidents, of course, have to talk about all kinds of issues affecting all kinds of people — whether they have direct experience with them or not. No president, for example, has ever given birth.Mr. Sanders has shown little hesitation in expressing his opinions on issues impacting Latinos, women or L.G.B.T.Q. Americans. (And he has found success with Latino voters, who make up just a sliver of the Michigan electorate.) Yet, while Mr. Sanders rattles off policy positions on issues like criminal justice, housing and education, he seems less comfortable driving a message around racial justice and the lived experiences of African-Americans.Part of the problem Mr. Sanders may face is fundamental: His campaign is deeply rooted in his democratic socialism, focused heavily on class as the root of all the country’s ills. Racial discrimination is a byproduct of economic inequality, rather than the cause, in Mr. Sanders’s telling.From Flint to Ann Arbor, Mr. Sanders cast his campaign as a unifying cause for working-class Americans, focused heavily on economic issues like the cost of college, unions, health care and low wages. He talks far less and in far less explicit terms about racial injustice.

The next morning, Mr. Jackson delivered a message focused on racial injustice, even calling for Mr. Sanders to put a black woman on the ticket.As I watched Mr. Jackson address thousands gathered in downtown Grand Rapids, I couldn’t help but think about what a fascinating political moment this must be for him. His dream of a “rainbow coalition” has been realized in today’s Democratic Party. As the Republican base grows ever whiter, Democrats have turned their diversity into their calling card.But with that more diverse base comes a desire not to be taken for granted.

In the majority of states, those people have not yet been elected by the party. That’s a process that typically happens at state party conventions well after the initial primaries or caucuses. When that happens, the delegates that are allocated based on statewide results — about 25 percent of the total — will just be reallocated to candidates still remaining in the race.The remaining 75 percent, which are allocated based on congressional district results, are technically still the property of the candidate who won them. But the actual delegates — meaning the humans — are not legally bound, so they’re likely to just vote for someone still in the race, probably the person whom their original candidate endorsed. That process typically happens with some behind-the-scenes coordination between the two campaigns (the one still operating and the one that ended).This reshuffling is a standard process in Democratic presidential politics and is part of the reason Democrats haven’t had a contested convention in decades. In 2016, some states unanimously announced that they backed Hillary Clinton at the party convention, even though she didn’t win all the delegates from those states. Then, like now, the delegates coalesced behind the winner.

"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preparing to unveil a sweeping plan to lower the cost of health care, moving to address the top concern of voters while giving moderate Democrats who face tough re-election races a way to distance themselves from the Medicare for All plan embraced by the progressive left and derided by Republicans as socialism.The legislation, timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, is part of a major push by Democrats to position themselves as the party of health care before the 2020 elections. Former President Barack Obama will support the effort, appearing with Ms. Pelosi at American University in Washington on March 23, 10 years to the day he signed the Affordable Care Act into law.While the measure has little chance of survival in the Republican-controlled Senate, it is the latest evidence that Democratic leaders, determined to protect their House majority and the moderate lawmakers who helped them to power, are looking for ways to distinguish their rank and file from the party’s presidential nominees.The plan bears no resemblance to Medicare for All, the national health insurance system championed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the self-described democratic socialist. And it omits a “public option” to create a government-run health insurer, an idea embraced by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner.

In steering clear of the ideas promoted by both leading presidential candidates, Ms. Pelosi is hoping to protect the so-called front-liners who flipped Republican seats in 2018 and delivered Democrats the majority.The speaker’s new proposal is aimed at reducing costs under the current health bill, according to people familiar with it, who insisted on anonymity to describe a plan that was not yet public. Details are still being finalized, and Ms. Pelosi — who was to meet Monday evening with Democratic committee chairs to discuss a response to the coronavirus epidemic — has not yet shared them with her rank and file. The speaker’s office declined to comment.The plan could be unveiled as early as this week, though coronavirus could upend that timeline. In eschewing Medicare for All, Ms. Pelosi is turning away from a proposal that does not have the votes to pass the House and has divided Democrats on Capitol Hill.Instead, the speaker is expected to propose a series of steps to make health care more cost-effective under the Affordable Care Act, including expanding tax credits and subsidies to help people buy insurance and creating a national program to help cover expenses for those with medical conditions. The plan is expected to spotlight ideas put forth by vulnerable freshmen like Representatives Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Angie Craig of Minnesota.But Ms. Pelosi’s reluctance to embrace Mr. Sanders’s bold vision may draw the ire of her caucus’ left wing, which is pushing for a vote on Medicare for All. Her decision to shy away from the public option is especially notable, given that the House included such a system when it passed its version of the Affordable Care Act in 2019.

That unifies the country and unifies the party,” Mr. Dach said. “What we have had is a debate with tremendous missed opportunities. Democrats should have been up there reminding people what Donald Trump has been doing to their health care, not arguing as much about where they want to go.”Polls show the public is deeply concerned about the high cost of health care but divided over what to do about it. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a slight majority of respondents — 53 percent — favored a Medicare for All approach that would cover everyone on a single government plan. A much larger majority, 65 percent, favored a public option.Republicans have latched onto Mr. Sanders and Medicare for All as a way to paint Democrats as socialists, a strategy that is unlikely to change no matter what proposal Ms. Pelosi puts forth or who becomes the Democratic nominee. “No one is opposed to a pragmatic step that’s feasible,” he said. “What we’re opposed to is a lack of imagination and boldness in not giving a vote on policies that economics and health experts are saying is what the country needs.”But Leslie Dach, a Democratic strategist and the chairman of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group, said it was important for Democrats to spotlight what they could agree on, especially after a string of presidential primary debates where Democrats beat up one another over their health care plans instead of going after President Trump.“If you do the polling, 80 percent of the people want to lower costs, and they want to protect critical things like pre-existing conditions.

Such positions, he said, “make the argument that Democrats have become socialists a particularly effective one, no matter how much they now try to run away from it.”The Affordable Care Act anniversary comes as the law itself is in fresh peril. It has survived numerous Republican attempts and a vow by Mr. Trump to repeal it, as well as a string of court challenges.But the Supreme Court, which has twice ruled to leave most of the provisions intact, recently agreed to hear a third case, which could wipe out the Affordable Care Act entirely. When Democrats took over the House in January 2019, they voted to intervene in the case, Texas v. U.S., which was brought by conservative state attorneys general seeking to overturn the law.Democrats campaigned aggressively in 2018 on lowering costs and protecting health coverage, and they have already taken some steps to make good on those promises.In May, they passed legislation to reverse Trump administration rules that allowed the expansion of health care plans that did not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act’s mandated coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. And in December, the House voted to lower the rising cost of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers.But like most legislation passed by House Democrats, the two health bills are languishing in the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, refuses to take them up. “Voters have watched as the Democratic Party has moved further and further left, to the point where now a majority of their members support canceling private health care entirely for BernieCare,” said Dan Conston, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee affiliated with House Republicans.

That bill aims to lower health insurance premiums by expanding eligibility for premium tax credits beyond 400 percent of the federal poverty line. It also increases the size of tax credits for people in all income brackets. It would create a so-called reinsurance program, which would provide government funds to help insurers offset the cost of patients with expensive medical conditions. And it would make subsidies more generous for people with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty line.Other Democrats, including Ms. Underwood and Ms. Craig, have put forth similar ideas. Ms. Underwood is the chief sponsor of a stand-alone plan to expand tax credits. Ms. Craig is promoting federal funding for states to run their own programs to reduce insurance premiums.It is measures like Ms. Pelosi’s — not the kind of systemwide overhaul advocated by Mr. Sanders — that House Democrats want to focus on as they seek to maintain their majority.“Our front-liners have been very focused on their message, which has been strengthening the A.C.A., making sure we’re continuing to cover pre-existing conditions, and making sure that we resist the constant cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and even Social Security that have been proposed,” said Representative Katherine M.

"PHOENIX — “This is a campaign of the working class, by the working class and for the working class!”Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont nearly shouted those words to a raucously supportive crowd here last week. The line received thunderous applause, as it always does.At campaign events over the past year, Mr. Sanders has spoken to tens of thousands of people who come to hear his message of political revolution — who come to imagine a country with universal health care, no student debt and a $15 minimum wage. Almost every line he says onstage rises to a crescendo, inviting cheers of appreciation. With every promise and policy proposal, the crowd becomes a sea of waving blue and white signs with the “Bernie” logo.The Sanders campaign has exposed a class divide within the Democratic Party: His promises of a leg up are most alluring to those who need it, and most confounding to those who do not.

Six more states go to the polls on Tuesday in what is now a head-to-head matchup in the Democratic presidential race between Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The path for Mr. Sanders to retake a delegate lead is much narrower than it was a week ago, but no matter how the primaries turn out for Mr. Sanders, he has built a fierce following of voters who want and expect more from their party, from their government, from their country.

That’s how Audrey Yanos views Mr. Sanders and this political moment. Ms. Yanos, a 39-year-old medical administrator, has voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election in her adult life. But Ms. Yanos has misgivings: Those Democrats, she believes, have never done all that much to deliver the promise of the American dream. She has begun to feel that the country has betrayed people like her.Mr. Sanders, she says, is different. Ms. Yanos voted for him in 2016, and did so again last Tuesday in the Colorado primary, which he won easily over Mr. Biden.“We are struggling all the time, and what we have is not working,” she said one evening last week during a brief break between dinner and her son’s basketball practice. “We’re all scraping by, one disaster away from real catastrophe, and we need someone who understands that.” That’s how Audrey Yanos views Mr. Sanders and this political moment.

If the Democratic Party wants to keep such voters engaged and committed to showing up in the fall, leaders will have to speak more directly to them and better address their needs.Many of his supporters know what it’s like to struggle in one way or another. They need prescription drugs but can’t afford them. They are buried under relentless student debt. They juggle jobs with caring for ailing parents or young children, or both. They want better lives, more stable lives, and need some help.When Mr. Sanders has asked people at his town halls to tell their stories — often by prodding them to share their insurance premiums or deductibles — their voices have sometimes shaken.

But Mr. Sanders also enjoys plenty of support in these states, particularly from white working-class voters. In both of his bids for the White House, Mr. Sanders has shown that his populist message resonates in some corners, even as it repels much of the Democratic establishment, which has steadily lined up behind Mr. Biden. Rallies for Mr. Sanders often resemble rock concerts, drawing tens of thousands of people who come decked out in campaign gear, with T-shirts that proclaim “Unidos con Bernie” and signs that say “Not me, Us.”Polling throughout the campaign has shown Mr. Sanders drawing some of his strongest support from voters with household incomes under $50,000; his numbers taper off as incomes rise. A month ago, when he was leading in the polls, people with household incomes of $50,000 and under supported Mr. Sanders twice as much as any other candidate. At that time, he commanded the support of most Democratic voters making $100,000 and under.Exit polls on Super Tuesday did not ask respondents directly about their income. But in the three states where he won and exit polls were conducted — Colorado, Vermont and California — Mr. Sanders performed five to eight percentage points better among those without a college degree than those with one. In Massachusetts and Minnesota, both states he had hoped to win but ended up losing decisively to Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders’s numbers among college graduates lagged his showing among those without degrees by double digits.“Bernie is the only candidate I’ve ever felt a connection to, in a sense that he genuinely cares about the working class in a way that no other candidate has ever shown support to us,” said Andrew Hilbert, 26, who came to see Mr. Sanders in Phoenix.Mr. Sanders’s support this year has proved particularly enduring in the West, where many communities remain visibly scarred by the Great Recession. And his focus on the working class helps explain part of his appeal to Latino voters, who are disproportionately young and are more likely to come from a working-class background. Many such voters point to the illusion of an “up by your bootstraps” mentality and strongly believe that the only way to create a fair economy is to drastically change the way the current one works.“We’ve had decades of policies fail to meet our needs, and we’ve got to break that cycle,” said Antonio Arellano, the executive director of Jolt, a group in Texas that focuses on turning out young Latino voters and that endorsed Mr. Sanders. “What we’re seeing for the first time ever is the courage to break from the past and radically build the future.

"WASHINGTON — North Korea has evaded United Nations sanctions for many months by exporting coal, sand and petroleum, and importing luxury goods including armored sedans, alcohol and robotic machinery. The findings are based on an upcoming U.N. report, other assessments using satellite images and shipping data, and interviews with analysts.The exports provide North Korea with money to continue developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, analysts say. And the imports of luxury goods show techniques that North Korea might also be using to procure dual-use technology for those programs, they say. The efforts to raise money are aided by the country’s sophisticated cybercrime operations that target financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges.The upcoming annual report from the United Nations Panel of Experts gives more detail on the smuggling of two armored Mercedes sedans that were shipped from the Netherlands to East Asia in 2018 and that were the subject of an investigation by The New York Times and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in July.The U.N. panel did its own investigation after the article and video appeared, and concluded that the cars were shipped from Europe after they were in the possession of two Italian companies — apparently the start of the supply chain, according to a draft of the report seen by The Times.

They’ve got to stop the ship-to-ship transfers,” Robert C. O’Brien, President Trump’s national security adviser, said last month. “We need the Chinese to assist us as we pressure the North Koreans to come to the table,” he added.

That came after the failure of the second summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February 2019.The porous sanctions mean the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against North Korea is far from effective, and American officials are losing what they say is their only real leverage. That could help explain Pyongyang’s recent cold shoulder toward Washington, experts say.

Mr. Kim surprised American officials this winter by not sending what North Korean officials had called a potential “Christmas gift” to Mr. Trump — possibly a test of a nuclear weapon or an intercontinental ballistic missile. In early 2019, Mr. Kim had given Mr. Trump a year-end deadline to lift sanctions.The successful evasion of sanctions might mean less urgency on Mr. Kim’s part in getting the penalties lifted. He continues to get revenue while building up his stockpile of fissile material, adding to the amount he already has for about 38 nuclear warheads, according to a recent estimate by Siegfried S. Hecker, the former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.North Korea has continued to carry out tests of short-range ballistic missiles and rocket systems, with no admonishment from Mr. Trump. On Monday, North Korea launched multiple projectiles off its east coast in the country’s second weapons test in a week. Before Monday’s tests, it fired two short-range projectiles off its east coast on March 2, its first weapons test in three months.

(Reuters first reported on parts of the U.N. study last month.)It is unclear how the global crisis over the new coronavirus, which began in China, will affect North Korea. The country has not reported any cases, but experts say there most likely are some. North Korea has closed almost all border entry points and put foreigners in the country under quarantine, but is now asking them to leave. Last month, the United States approved the transfer of humanitarian aid, and the United Nations has allowed some exemptions to sanctions for aid.“On the North Korean side, they have asked for assistance and will need to coordinate points of entry for the urgent supplies with the aid organizations,” said Kee Park, a Korean-American doctor who regularly leads medical delegations to North Korea.North Korean leaders might have to use some of the revenue accrued from smuggling for social welfare needs, if they are not doing so already.Some analysts say the visit to North Korea in June by President Xi Jinping of China might have marked a turning point in sanctions enforcement.“Given the deterioration of U.S.-China ties, Beijing’s leaders are in no mood to cooperate with Washington on North Korea issues,” said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst on North Korea who is now at the Brookings Institution. “And judging from the opening of new resort and tourism areas and robust department store offerings, the regime and the elite are successfully finding loopholes.” The draft of the U.N. report says North Korea conducted 13 missile tests and launched 25 missiles in 2019.

North Korea is raising millions of dollars through the smuggling of commodities, the U.N. report says.Last October, Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, a member of the United Nations Panel of Experts from 2014 to 2019, wrote on the 38 North website that the “maximum pressure” campaign on North Korea was “on its last legs.”“The Trump administration bears special responsibility for this situation,” she wrote. “It has been its own worst enemy in the maximum-pressure campaign.”She asserted that Mr. Trump “remains unwilling to admit fault or failure for the lack of progress on denuclearization or to change the U.S. approach to negotiations with the North.”North Korea has been creative in its sources of revenue. Both the upcoming U.N. report and a separate post this month by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies noted an increase in sand-dredging activity by North Korean ships in 2019. A center of the operation was in Haeju Bay, North Korea, from March to August. Chinese companies are the main buyer of the sand, an important material in construction projects and in making silicon chips. The holes in sanctions go well beyond the importing of luxury goods.

"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether judges must determine that juvenile offenders are incorrigible before sentencing them to die in prison. The case, involving a teenager who killed his grandfather, is the latest in a series of cases on the constitutionality of harsh punishments for youths who commit crimes before they turn 18.The case, Jones v. Mississippi, No. 18-1259, concerns Brett Jones, who had recently turned 15 in 2004 when his grandfather discovered his girlfriend in his room. The two men argued and fought, and the youth, who had been making a sandwich, stabbed his grandfather eight times, killing him.In 2005, Mr. Jones was convicted of murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, the mandatory penalty under state law.In 2012, in Miller v. Alabama, the Supreme Court ruled that automatic life sentences for juvenile offenders violated the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The decision repeatedly criticized mandatory sentences, suggesting that only ones in which judges could take account of the defendant’s age were permissible.

Alabama, the Supreme Court ruled that automatic life sentences for juvenile offenders violated the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The decision repeatedly criticized mandatory sentences, suggesting that only ones in which judges could take account of the defendant’s age were permissible. In Montgomery v. Louisiana in 2016, the court made the Miller decision retroactive. In the process, it seemed to read the Miller decision to bar life without parole not only for defendants who received mandatory sentences but also “for all but the rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility.After the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Miller, the Mississippi Supreme Court granted Mr. Jones a new sentencing hearing.After the hearing, the trial judge resentenced Mr. Jones to life without parole. “The court did not find that Brett was permanently incorrigible, nor did it acknowledge that only permanently incorrigible juvenile homicide offenders may be sentenced to life without parole,” Mr. Jones’s lawyers told the U.S. Supreme Court in their petition seeking review. “In fact, it did not address Brett’s capacity for rehabilitation at all.”The question of whether judges must find that juvenile offenders are incorrigible before sentencing them to die in prison has divided state supreme courts.In his response to Mr. Jones’s petition, Jim Hood, Alabama’s attorney general, wrote that Mr. Jones had received an adequate hearing and that no specific finding of incorrigibility was required. In Montgomery v. Louisiana in 2016, the court made the Miller decision retroactive.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump has spent the past several weeks dismissing concerns about any economic effects from the coronavirus and insisting that American companies and consumers are in no danger.On Monday, after stock markets suffered their worst single-day decline in more than a decade, Treasury yields reached new lows and oil prices plummeted, Mr. Trump said he was ready to act.The president said the White House would unveil “very dramatic” proposals to help protect the American economy from the coronavirus, including financial help for workers who don’t get paid sick leave, tax cuts and targeted relief for industries battered by the virus, including cruise lines, airlines and hotels.The overture sets up tense negotiations with Congress, just weeks after the president was impeached by House Democrats and less than a year from Election Day. Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump’s efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president’s handling of the crisis.

Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump’s efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president’s handling of the crisis. Democrats have expressed openness to certain measures of stimulus — like paid sick leave and increased spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps — that could provide the building blocks for a deal with the president. And Mr. Trump’s efforts could be aided by the fact that federal borrowing costs have fallen to rock-bottom rates as skittish investors in recent days have piled into safe U.S. government debt.Mr. Trump’s decision to seek fiscal help amounts to concession by a White House that has ignored increasingly ominous predictions of the virus’s economic effects, which have ranged from dramatically slowing growth in the United States to plunging the economy into recession.That threat was compounded over the weekend by Saudi Arabia’s announcement that it would ramp up oil production, sending prices into a downward spiral and raising the threat of layoffs and shelved investments in the American oil industry.Mr. Trump and his aides had played down the economic threats as recently as Monday morning, when the president celebrated falling gas prices as “good for the consumer” while blaming the stock plunge on a combination of Saudi Arabia, Russia and “fake news.” He also suggested fears about the virus were overblown, saying more people have died from the flu than the new coronavirus. “Life & the economy go on,” he tweeted.

“We have a very strong economy,” he said. “This blindsided the world.”White House officials have known for more than a month that the virus posed a threat to public health and economic growth in the United States, but they have consistently said the economy would not need additional support to weather it. When asked about any economic fallout, Mr. Trump has put the onus on the Federal Reserve, saying it should cut interest rates and do more to stimulate growth.But investors have largely shrugged off the Fed’s efforts. An emergency rate cut announced last Tuesday did little to mitigate the damage, as investors digested the economic ramifications of a virus that has shuttered factories, canceled travel and quarantined workers.A growing chorus of economists, many of them veterans of President Barack Obama’s administration, have called for Mr. Trump and Congress to further support growth by injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into the consumer economy. Mr. Trump’s team initially rejected such calls.Any large spending increases or tax cuts will require a deal with the Democrats who control the House and can block most legislation in the Senate. Leading Democrats gave Mr. Trump’s new proposals a cool reception on Monday evening.A Democratic official on Capitol Hill said that party leaders did not like the idea of bailing out individual industries, like airlines, with targeted tax cuts. A spokeswoman for House Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee said they had not heard directly from the White House about the proposals before the news conference. “What was glaringly missing from President Trump’s news conference was how he is actually going to combat the spread of the coronavirus and keep the American people safe,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. “It seems President Trump is more focused on the stock market than addressing this pandemic.“Mr. Schumer called on Mr. Trump to propose a package that included “ensuring tests and treatment are both available and affordable to all who need it and paid sick leave for all Americans workers, among other people-focused initiatives.”After Speaker Nancy Pelosi convened a meeting Monday evening with her top committee chairman to discuss the Democrats’ response, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, emerged to throw cold water on Mr. Trump’s payroll tax cut, saying it was not “what we need right now.”“What the economy needs right now is some stability and confidence that we’re addressing the issue that is undermining the economy,” he said. “The president’s answer for almost everything is a tax cut. We think we need to make sure that people, and health facilities and insurance companies and others, have confidence that they’re not going to be bankrupted by this.”Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday that the relief measures proposed by the White House would ensure that Americans do not have to worry about losing their jobs or missing paychecks because of the coronavirus.Mr. Trump’s comments came after he met with his economic advisers on Monday afternoon. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, are expected to present the stimulus proposals to Republican lawmakers on Tuesday.Mr. Mnuchin said at the briefing that he had been having daily conversations with Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He insisted that the administration would use all tools at its disposal to ensure that the United States economy was in good shape a year from now. “What was glaringly missing from President Trump’s news conference was how he is actually going to combat the spread of the coronavirus and keep the American people safe,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. “It seems President Trump is more focused on the stock market than addressing this pandemic.“Mr. Schumer called on Mr. Trump to propose a package that included “ensuring tests and treatment are both available and affordable to all who need it and paid sick leave for all Americans workers, among other people-focused initiatives.”After Speaker Nancy Pelosi convened a meeting Monday evening with her top committee chairman to discuss the Democrats’ response, Representative Steny H.

But warning signs abound. Credit markets are beginning to show signs of strain, investors are fleeing indexes that track risky bonds, and some economists are questioning whether the coronavirus could spark a corporate debt crisis. “If the virus triggers a sharper drop in profits or a bigger rise in borrowing costs than we envisage, then these pockets of vulnerability could blow up,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note last week. “Although the global banking system appears to be better placed to deal with such turbulence now than at the time of the global financial crisis, at the very least this could exacerbate any virus-related global downturn.”The White House has invited top Wall Street executives to a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout, according to an official.As recently as January, Federal Reserve officials expressed worry that “financial imbalances — including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness — could amplify an adverse shock to the economy.”Corporate debt has skyrocketed over the past decade, and more than half of investment-grade company debt is just one notch above a “junk” rating, with BBB debt in the United States now totaling more than $3 trillion. Such bonds are vulnerable to status downgrades in tough times — Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners estimates that as much as $1 trillion of investment-grade debt could soon head to junk.That is of particular concern because mutual funds are holding big chunks of BBB debt. Funds could be forced to dump those holdings quickly in the face of downgrades because many are not allowed to invest in junk bonds. “If the virus triggers a sharper drop in profits or a bigger rise in borrowing costs than we envisage, then these pockets of vulnerability could blow up,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note last week. “Although the global banking system appears to be better placed to deal with such turbulence now than at the time of the global financial crisis, at the very least this could exacerbate any virus-related global downturn.”The White House has invited top Wall Street executives to a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout, according to an official.As recently as January, Federal Reserve officials expressed worry that “financial imbalances — including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness — could amplify an adverse shock to the economy.”Corporate debt has skyrocketed over the past decade, and more than half of investment-grade company debt is just one notch above a “junk” rating, with BBB debt in the United States now totaling more than $3 trillion.

Funds could be forced to dump those holdings quickly in the face of downgrades because many are not allowed to invest in junk bonds. “We arrive at this moment with the overleveraged corporate sector about to face the prospect that new-issue bond markets may seize up, as they did last week, and that even seemingly sound companies will find credit expensive or difficult to obtain,” Mr. Minerd wrote in a note on Sunday.
Leveraged loans, which banks and other financial institutions extend to already indebted companies, have also ballooned. Outstanding leveraged loans now total about $1.2 trillion, roughly twice pre-crisis levels. The loans are often funded by investment vehicles that bundle, slice and sell them off to investors — and because banks do not end up holding many of them on their balance sheets, regulators have limited ability to oversee them.To put the size of those vulnerable debt and loan piles in perspective, Americans had $1.3 trillion in outstanding subprime mortgages headed into the 2008 crisis, based on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates. When those debts went bad, it helped knock the financial system to its knees.Investors are already spooked about risky credit in a time of coronavirus. Indexes that track high-yield debt and leveraged loans have had record outflows over the past two weeks, as people take their money and run, seeking safer investments.“We are concerned about potential cracks in the U.S. credit cycle in an environment of dwindling corporate cash flows, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions that feeds back into the real economy,” Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at Pimco, wrote in a research note Sunday.While banks have limited direct exposures to the riskiest loans — which could keep any messiness in that sector from turning into a full-blown financial meltdown — they and the broader economy would still be affected if things soured quickly.“In the event of corporate debt distress, firms may reduce investment and cut payrolls to continue servicing their debt,” according to one 2019 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report. That could make it harder for households and businesses — bank customers — to pay back their own debt, and “banks could incur losses.” And the financial crisis was painful, in part, because banks stopped lending, leaving consumers without access to cash. They could do that fairly abruptly in 2020 in part because of a new accounting standard, called current expected credit losses methodology.The rule took hold for big banks this year, and forces them to value loans over their lifetime — a measure meant to more accurately gauge risk, but one that could also make projected losses look more drastic when the economy is worsening. The change is expected to dissuade lenders from extending new mortgages and lines of credit during times of stress.“To avoid huge accounting losses, which cut into capital, the effect would be to not lend, or to lend less,” said Joshua Ronen, an accounting professor at New York University. That could “paradoxically” hit the most strapped borrowers, he said, since they are often the worst credit risk.Strains to the financial system could come at a particularly bad time. Big financial firms outside the banking sector remain largely out of regulatory oversight, including asset managers, hedge funds, private equity firms and big insurers.And the rules governing regulated institutions have become gradually less stringent. The Fed made a regulatory change last week, which one official — the Fed governor Lael Brainard, an Obama administration pick — warned could significantly reduce capital at the biggest banks.Fed officials had already expressed concern in January that banks might be returning too much of their profits to shareholders, leaving them exposed if there is another big downturn. “Planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in capital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks,” according to minutes of the meeting.Banking regulators have also been working to relax the Volcker Rule, which prohibited banks from making risky bets with their customers’ deposits. Banks took major losses on their derivatives holdings in the 2008 crisis, helping to exacerbate financial system strains. Proposed changes would allow banks to invest in some credit funds and sponsor or take ownership stakes in venture capital funds, which pool ultrarich investors’ money to bet on start-ups.

Under the Obama administration, the council determined that four large non-bank companies, including American International Group, were “systemically important,” meaning those firms would be subject to Fed oversight.Under Mr. Mnuchin’s leadership, the council has released those firms from federal oversight and abandoned efforts to designate any other firm as “systemic.” It has opted instead to assess whether any financial “activities” pose risks to the system. None have been identified.And the Office of Financial Research, an independent agency created in 2010 to serve as an early warning system for emerging risks, has been gutted and marginalized over the past three years, with Mr. Mnuchin recommending that the agency become a “functional part of Treasury,” with its director chosen by the Treasury secretary rather than the president. “We are in a much more fragile situation than we should be because the regulators haven’t been on the job,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform. “This is a real economic crisis we’re facing.”Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, warned in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week that the country faced a potential “economic calamity.” He called on Mr. Mnuchin to work with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which he chairs, to come up with a plan.“I am concerned that you and your fellow regulators on the council have repeatedly failed to take action to make the financial system more resilient, putting our economy at risk as we experience the first period of financial stress under your watch,” Mr. Brown wrote.Mr. Mnuchin has been criticized for weakening safeguards put in place to prevent a repeat of 2008, when regulators were largely caught off guard by the severity of losses at financial firms, including those outside the banking sector.Congress created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify risks to the financial system and respond to emerging threats.

The agency’s staff has been slashed by more than 50 percent since 2017 to 96 employees, and its role has been relegated to largely assisting the Financial Stability Oversight Council, rather than collecting and analyzing data to identify emerging economic threats across financial sectors, according to current and former officials.“Once Trump took office, every day they have been finding ways to deregulate and weaken the financial regulatory structure,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “They clearly are not prepared for a financial crisis, no matter what precipitates it.”Mr. Mnuchin tried to calm markets at a congressional hearing last week by arguing that this would not be 2008 all over again and that any economic slowdown caused by the virus would quickly abate.“This is very different than the financial crisis,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “There will be an end in sight.”Bank lobbyists have seized on the coronavirus as a reason to usher in even more deregulation.The Bank Policy Institute published a memorandum this month suggesting several measures that regulators could take to help financial institutions expand lending during trying times — including carrying out the streamlined capital rules, which the Fed did just days later.Gregg Gelzinis, senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said the ideas represented a longstanding wish list for big banks.“In their eyes, when the economy is booming it’s as good a time to deregulate as when the economy is experiencing some stress,” Mr. Gelzinis said. “It’s always a good time to roll back rules on Wall Street.” The agency’s staff has been slashed by more than 50 percent since 2017 to 96 employees, and its role has been relegated to largely assisting the Financial Stability Oversight Council, rather than collecting and analyzing data to identify emerging economic threats across financial sectors, according to current and former officials.“Once Trump took office, every day they have been finding ways to deregulate and weaken the financial regulatory structure,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “They clearly are not prepared for a financial crisis, no matter what precipitates it.”Mr. Mnuchin tried to calm markets at a congressional hearing last week by arguing that this would not be 2008 all over again and that any economic slowdown caused by the virus would quickly abate.“This is very different than the financial crisis,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “There will be an end in sight.”Bank lobbyists have seized on the coronavirus as a reason to usher in even more deregulation.The Bank Policy Institute published a memorandum this month suggesting several measures that regulators could take to help financial institutions expand lending during trying times — including carrying out the streamlined capital rules, which the Fed did just days later.Gregg Gelzinis, senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said the ideas represented a longstanding wish list for big banks.“In their eyes, when the economy is booming it’s as good a time to deregulate as when the economy is experiencing some stress,” Mr. Gelzinis said. “It’s always a good time to roll back rules on Wall Street.”","Financial System Faces Biggest Test Since 2008 as Coronavirus SpreadsThe Trump administration has chipped away at the post-crisis regulatory system, moves that could expose financial system vulnerabilities if the economic threat from the virus intensifies.By Alan Rappeport and Jeanna Smialek",2020-03-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/us/politics/financial-regulations-coronavirus.html,new_york_times

The package also ensures 14 days of paid sick leave, as well as tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses fulfill that mandate. Language was still being drafted for provisions related to family and medical leave, according to a Democratic aide, as staff members worked through the night to prepare the bill.Ms. Pelosi, in her letter to lawmakers, also said that the House would soon pursue another package “that will take further effective action that protects the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.” WASHINGTON — Financial markets plunged on Thursday in the biggest one-day drop since the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987, and Congress neared a deal with the White House on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the colossal effect of the coronavirus pandemic.After a day of intense negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that “we’ve resolved most of our differences” and the House would vote on Friday on the measure “one way or another.” It would then go to the Senate, which called off a recess that had been scheduled for next week in anticipation of a compromise.The legislation, according to a letter Ms. Pelosi sent to her members, will include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, aid for food assistance programs and federal funds for Medicaid.

The Federal Reserve, in a drastic attempt to ensure Wall Street remained functional as volatility roiled even normally staid bond markets, said it would promptly inject as much as $1.5 trillion in loans into the banking system and broaden its purchases of Treasury securities. But neither the Fed’s actions, nor a plan by the European Central Bank to offer cheap loans to banks and step up its bond-buying campaign, were enough to assuage investors, who sent the S&P 500 down 9.5 percent.President Trump, for his part, appeared to be scrambling to persuade the public that things were going smoothly, while suggesting he could further restrict travel. Speaking at the White House, Mr. Trump said he could conceivably ban domestic travel to regions of the United States where the coronavirus becomes “too hot.”His comments came on the heels of his abrupt decision Wednesday night to impose sweeping travel restrictions on non-American citizens from nearly all of continental Europe, a step that angered his foreign counterparts and contributed to the global stock sell-off.

As Washington raced to mount a quick response, local governments, sports franchises, schools and cultural institutions moved to try to quell the spread of a virus that has sickened at least 132,300 people worldwide, including more than 1,500 in the United States. So far, at least 39 people have died from the virus in the country.

So much was being shut down so fast that it promised to change life as most Americans know it and bring about a spring unlike any before.
In an extraordinary step, governors in Connecticut, New Jersey, California, Ohio, Washington State and New York moved to ban large gatherings and restrict smaller ones. Broadway announced it would be turning off the lights. The Metropolitan Museum of Art said that it would temporarily close its three locations, including its Fifth Avenue flagship. The two biggest concert promoters suspended all their current tours until at least April, and Disneyland, the happiest place on earth, closed its doors for only the fourth time in history.Schools across the country, including in Ohio and Maryland, announced they would shut for several weeks, while students at dozens of colleges and universities packed up and headed home for the foreseeable future. The N.C.A.A. announced there would be no March Madness this year as Major League Baseball postponed the start of its regular season by at least two weeks, canceling spring training games effective immediately. The N.H.L., N.B.A. and Major League Soccer also said they would pause or suspend their seasons.“It’s the right thing to do but obviously it stinks,” the Florida Panthers center Aleksander Barkov said in a telephone interview.European leaders were struggling with how to respond, both to the outbreak on their shores and to Mr. Trump, who did not consult them before blocking most visitors from continental Europe to the United States for 30 days.

In a strongly worded statement, the European Union said it “disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.” It said that it was “taking strong action to limit the spread” of the coronavirus, but that it “is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.’’Asked on Thursday why he had not consulted foreign leaders beforehand, Mr. Trump said, “We had to make a decision, and I didn’t want to take time.”The administration’s approach has sown confusion at home, with conflicting messages emanating from the White House and health officials as well as from individual government agencies.In a meeting at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Trump sought to play down the pandemic and its effects on the financial markets, saying, “It’s going to work out fine.” He insisted, “Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth,” even as the government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, was on Capitol Hill acknowledging to lawmakers that “it is a failing — I mean, let’s admit it.” In a strongly worded statement, the European Union said it “disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.” It said that it was “taking strong action to limit the spread” of the coronavirus, but that it “is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.’’Asked on Thursday why he had not consulted foreign leaders beforehand, Mr. Trump said, “We had to make a decision, and I didn’t want to take time.”The administration’s approach has sown confusion at home, with conflicting messages emanating from the White House and health officials as well as from individual government agencies.In a meeting at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Trump sought to play down the pandemic and its effects on the financial markets, saying, “It’s going to work out fine.” He insisted, “Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth,” even as the government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, was on Capitol Hill acknowledging to lawmakers that “it is a failing — I mean, let’s admit it.” The president claimed that anyone who wanted to board a flight to the United States must first test negative for the virus, although there is no such policy. And he said a rally that he had been planning in Tampa, Fla., was “all sold out,” even though the idea of scheduling it was scrapped before it was ever announced.Mr. Trump himself may have been exposed to the virus after coming into contact with a Brazilian official who tested positive just days after participating in meetings with him in Florida.

Cabinet officials have been waiting for the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to send out official guidance addressing changes to telework policies, when to impose mandatory telecommuting, whether to reconsider hosting meetings and gatherings, and whether to cancel travel — guidance that would allow them to change their own policies.The lack of a clear, consistent response in the United States has only fueled the market sell-off, and this week the messiness extended to even the safest bonds, putting financial functioning at risk and prompting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to take significant steps on Thursday to show markets that it has their backs. The New York Fed increased the size of its repurchase operations — basically short-term loans to banks — by $1.5 trillion through Friday, added to its weekly repurchase offerings, and shifted its Treasury purchases so that they extend across durations instead of focusing on shorter-term bills.The package was meant to calm Treasury markets, where conditions had deteriorated in recent days, in part by making sure that as banks take bonds onto their balance sheets, they can have access to the funding they need to cover those positions. That the Fed is now buying across a range of maturities could help relieve pressures across the market.But investors, along with the public, appeared inconsolable and desperate for Congress to unleash aid that could help either stop the spread of the virus or at least buffet an economic hit that is threatening to tip the United States into recession.

House Democrats had initially scheduled a Thursday vote on their own package, signaling that they were ready to push it through even over Republican objections, and Senate Republicans who denounced the plan faced the prospect of leaving Washington having taken no action to address the widening crisis. “Until there are details on the steps that leadership intends to pursue to remedy the economic effects of the viral outbreak, equity markets will be vulnerable,” said Carl Tannenbaum, the chief economist at Northern Trust.Progress toward a compromise between Democrats and the Trump administration was a remarkable turnaround after a day of doubts — on Wall Street and in Washington — about whether a deal would be possible.

The negotiations hit snags as Republicans balked at the sweeping proposal to provide paid sick leave, something Senate Republicans had already blocked when Democrats sought earlier in the week to bring up a separate bill. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, started the day criticizing Ms. Pelosi’s plan as an “ideological wish list” and indicating that the Senate had no intention of moving ahead with it. But as negotiations proceeded, he faced mounting complaints from Republican senators — including those facing challenging re-election races — who opposed the House Democrats’ plan but were reluctant to leave Washington without voting on something to address the crisis.“A haphazard bill thrown together overnight?” Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, told reporters on Thursday. “We need to be thorough about it.”“The Senate has no business leaving,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said in a speech on the floor. “We shouldn’t leave town until we pass the House package to help workers and support our communities, and President Trump needs to sign it. We need to do our jobs.”Senators did leave Washington on Thursday afternoon, but they planned to return on Monday, even as the coronavirus took its toll on the Capitol, prompting more lawmakers to quarantine themselves and close their offices.

"WASHINGTON — As he confronts the most serious crisis of his tenure, President Trump has been assertive in closing borders to many outsiders, one of his favorite policies.

Mr. Trump had no hesitance to kibbitz from the side before he became president, assailing President Barack Obama for not doing enough to stop Ebola, for instance. But his own White House has separated into camps of those who think the administration needs to be doing more and those who share — and reinforce — Mr. Trump’s own view that the news media is overreacting to and creating a panic around the coronavirus.After feeling besieged by enemies for three years, Mr. Trump and some of his advisers view so many issues through the lens of political warfare — assuming that criticism is all about point scoring — that it has become hard to see what is real and what is not, according to people around the president. Even when others with Mr. Trump’s best interests at heart disagree, they find it hard to penetrate what they see as the bubble around him.

Bossert, a former homeland security adviser to Mr. Trump, has tried repeatedly in recent days to be patched through to the president or Vice President Mike Pence to warn them just how dire the coronavirus pandemic really is, only to be blocked by White House officials, according to two people familiar with the events. It left him to try to get the president’s — and the public’s — attention through newspaper op-ed articles, television appearances and Twitter messages like the one that panned Mr. Trump’s Europe travel ban as “poor use of time & energy.” Thomas P.

Some officials there also denied that he had made extensive efforts to speak with Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence.Among the advisers who share the president’s more jaundiced view is his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who considers the problem more about public psychology than a health reality, according to people who have spoken with him. Mr. Kushner has gotten more involved in the response in recent days, according to three White House advisers. A person close to Mr. Kushner said his views were being misinterpreted, and that he was focused on trying to find answers to the most immediate measures to mitigate the virus’s spread.
Marc Short, Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, approached Mr. Kushner on Monday about integrating the White House teams working on the issue, as the vice president’s communications shop is overrun with media requests and the White House is changing the chief of staff. After that, Mr. Kushner seized more of a role, spending Wednesday with Mr. Trump, the officials said. One administration official said on Thursday that Mr. Kushner, his wife, Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser who has just returned to the White House, favored Mr. Trump giving Wednesday night’s prime-time address to calm the waters amid rampaging uncertainty and fear.

Ms. Trump, the president’s elder daughter, in particular favored the address, according to three administration officials. But the subject quickly became contentious internally, according to several administration officials. Drafts were written and rewritten, beginning around 5 p.m., with Mr. Kushner seen as in charge as the president’s chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, wrote, and the communications office of the West Wing left out of the discussions.By early evening, only two hours before the camera was to go on, it was still not entirely clear what Mr. Trump was going to say. In a meeting in the Cabinet Room, a number of top officials told the president the speech was a good idea, with a notable exception being the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who said that Mr. Trump ought to wait at least a day or two so as to provide officials with more information. The president told aides gathered in the room, who disagreed on exactly how far he should go in terms of a travel ban from Europe, to come up with something and bring it to him, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events.The health experts were either supportive of or neutral about a proposed ban on some European travelers, even as Mr. Mnuchin disagreed, and so the plan moved forward, with other items — like more specific recommendations for schools and crowds — left unmentioned.When the camera turned on, the president appeared uncomfortable, reading words from the teleprompter in a stiff manner that made no emotional connection to a television audience of millions scared about a virus they cannot see and uncertain about a society rapidly transforming around them.Even with the text on the screen, the president mischaracterized his own policies in a way that required his administration to correct him afterward. Administration officials said there were two errors in the teleprompter text, and one that Mr. Trump garbled as he read it, adding the word “only” in a sentence that was intended to say the ban did not apply to trade and cargo, a line that spooked markets.He referred to the pandemic as a “foreign virus” that “will not have a chance against us” as if it were a hostile nation to be defeated on the battlefield. But while he talked about measures to prop up the economy, he did not discuss the troubles with the availability of testing kits or express understanding of the changes in everyday life affecting so many Americans.

Some close aides did not think the errors in the speech were particularly significant. By Thursday morning, it was clear that the speech had not assuaged the financial markets, which plummeted another 10 percent, the worst single day since Black Monday in 1987. Together with the losses of recent weeks, the markets have now erased about 85 percent of the gains of the entire Trump presidency, gains that were the foundation of his argument for re-election.

Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, which had just harshly criticized the president’s “failures of leadership” in handling the outbreak, saw some progress in the speech even as he expressed concern that it would not last.“The speech represents a marked, welcome improvement in the president’s rhetoric,” he wrote, “but that won’t matter if he goes out and undercuts it tomorrow, and the ultimate verdict on his response will be rendered based on the results.”The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page likewise called the speech “a step toward more realism” but added that Mr. Trump was not forthcoming enough about the scope of the problem.Republicans close to the White House privately laid blame at the feet of Mr. Kushner. A person close to Mr. Kushner described that as unfair, saying that he was merely helping out and that it becomes easier to blame him when things are difficult. And in any case, a partial travel ban on Europe was a bold move that may have been bound to rattle the markets rather than calm them no matter what.The White House insisted that the president’s actions have had the support of health officials, and that local communities should make decisions based on their own conditions.

Aides said the speech demonstrated to Americans that Mr. Trump understands the situation and is determined to react strongly to guard their well-being. “The reaction has been very favorable across the country,” Mr. Pence said Thursday on Fox News.

"Elections officials in the next four Democratic primary states are taking extra precautions before voters head to the polls on Tuesday, as the coronavirus upends the 2020 race and people worry about gatherings and places where they might become infected.There are no plans to cancel primaries in the four states — Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona — and officials are expressing confidence that ballots can be safely cast.

In all four states, the counties run the elections, but state officials have been trying to underscore the new basics of voting, like keeping hand sanitizer at polling locations and making sure local officials properly clean machines. At this point, none of the states are considering expanding polling hours or mail-in-ballot deadlines. Some elected officials in states voting after Tuesday, however, have expressed concern about the safety of an election during the outbreak. In New York City, a city council member called on the city to postpone the special election for the Queens Borough President, which is scheduled for March 24th. “We cannot put our students, voters, and poll workers at risk,” Donovan Richards, the city councilmember and chair of the council committee on public safety, said in a statement.And on Wednesday, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a bill that would “require all states to offer an option for voters to mail in or drop-off a hand-marked, paper ballot” if more than a quarter of states declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus.Yet for the states voting on Tuesday, the preparations for voting in the age of a pandemic have not led to far-reaching changes. Perhaps the most significant shift will be the relocation of polling stations away from areas where older people live, like assisted living facilities.
Here’s a look at what is happening in each state.OhioFrank LaRose, the Ohio secretary of state, has directed all county election boards to relocate voting locations that are near places where a high concentration of older people live, and county officials have been working to find new polling sites.On Wednesday, the county boards reported to the secretary of state’s office that they had identified 128 locations around the state that would need to be changed. In Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, 26 polling locations have been moved. Ohio, which has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus, has also expanded curbside drop-off of absentee ballots in response to the outbreak, to help keep those who are vulnerable away from crowds. As of Wednesday, the state had received roughly 336,000 absentee ballot requests. compared with about 328,000 at the same point in 2016.Another worry is the availability of poll workers, a volunteer group that skews older, and whose absence on Election Day could lead to longer lines and bigger crowds. In Ohio, the secretary of state’s office said it had been “proactively requesting additional recruitment from state and local government employees, outside organizations and even college students to step up and serve Ohio as poll workers.”“In fact, as of early this afternoon, we’ve had 582 Ohioans sign up to be poll workers just since Tuesday,” said Jon Keeling, the communications director for Mr. LaRose. “We’ve been thrilled with how many have stepped up.”IllinoisTwo of the largest voting jurisdictions in Illinois, Cook County and Chicago, obtained a court order on Thursday that will allow the counties to issue vote-by-mail ballots to all nursing home residents in their jurisdictions. The order also removes the requirement to send election judges into nursing homes to conduct voting.“Nursing homes around the state are withdrawing as polling places, so local election authorities are relocating polling places and sending out statutorily required notifications to affected voters,” said Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections. He said that included more than 100 locations in the Chicago area.FloridaIn Florida, which has also declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has urged county elections supervisors to move polling places out of assisted living facilities.“That’s problematic,” he told reporters on Wednesday in Tallahassee, the state capital, adding that residents should still be able to vote there, but not the general public.

Those locations asked for the change, but not all senior facilities have, in part because they want residents to have the convenience of voting there, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for Supervisor Peter Antonacci.The department has bought “oodles” of soap, paper towels, rubbing alcohol and wipes, he added. It already had a supply of gloves.“We’re putting signs at every precinct encouraging everybody approaching to wash their hands,” Mr. Vancore said. “We have plenty of Purell hand sanitizer available. The poll workers are being asked and encouraged to wear gloves.”Poll workers will be wiping down voting booths “as they can,” he said.“We’re doing this in real time,” he said of the last-minute changes to cope with the virus. “We’re doing everything we can, and everybody’s working together to make sure the facilities are clean and people are aware.”ArizonaThe Arizona secretary of state’s office has recommended that voters either cast ballots by mail, which should have been postmarked by Wednesday to be safe, or drop off a vote-by-mail ballot at a designated location before polls close on Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office also urged people to cast ballots in person at early-voting sites, which are open until Friday.In a news release on Wednesday, Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state in Arizona, said she wanted to “remind voters to make a plan for participating in this election.” “I think there’s a way to do that,” he said. “That’s a prudent step to take.”The state has temporarily restricted visits to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult family-care homes, long-term care facilities and adult group homes to keep out international and cruise ship travelers and other people who might have been exposed to the coronavirus.In Broward County, where a small cluster of coronavirus cases has been tied to the Port Everglades seaport, the elections department plans to move six polling places out of assisted living facilities.

And while the virus may depress in-person turnout, he said, his county has already seen a surge in mail-in votes.“Of course turnout will suffer a little bit, but we’ve already got more ballots cast by Democrats in this Democratic presidential preference election than we had cast by Democrats in 2016,” he said. “And it is going to go even higher, and we haven’t hit Election Day.”Reid J.

Two-thirds of Democratic voters said the opposite. All together, a slight majority of Americans expressed serious concern.

Two-thirds of Democratic voters said the opposite. All together, a slight majority of Americans expressed serious concern. And Democratic voters were about twice as likely as Republicans to worry that they or someone they knew could catch the virus, the poll found. Sixty-three percent of Republican voters said they were relatively unconcerned.
Geography could play a role, as Democrats are more likely to live in cities, which are the sites of the worst outbreaks. But this partisan divide may well be linked to the kind of media people consume: While most newspapers and TV networks are treating the crisis as a dire threat and covering local governments’ efforts to contain it, many right-wing pundits are casting doubt on the virus’s risks and even its very existence — following a precedent set by President Trump, who has played down the danger of the virus.On his nationally syndicated radio show, Sean Hannity wondered aloud on Wednesday if the coronavirus might be a “fraud” — just hours before Mr. Trump delivered a televised address about the virus. During that speech, Mr. Trump announced a temporary partial ban on travel to the United States from Europe, but he stopped short of instituting nationwide limits on public gatherings or the kind of other federal guidance that some world leaders have given to their countries. During that speech, Mr. Trump announced a temporary partial ban on travel to the United States from Europe, but he stopped short of instituting nationwide limits on public gatherings or the kind of other federal guidance that some world leaders have given to their countries. Over all, Americans are skeptical of Mr. Trump’s ability to confront the crisis. Last month, before the virus had spread throughout the United States, 62 percent of voters nationwide said they were not very confident in the federal government’s ability to deal with it effectively, according to a Fox News poll. Democratic voters were more than twice as likely as Republicans to say that they had no confidence at all.For weeks, Mr. Trump oscillated between reassurances that he had the situation under control and suggestions that the whole issue was vastly overblown. Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party’s leading presidential candidate, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have called the situation grave and pushed for an aggressive response.Mr. Biden and his leading rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, canceled in-person rallies this week and announced online campaign events in their stead. On Thursday, both candidates strongly criticized Mr. Trump’s address to the nation.“Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president,” Mr. Biden said. He offered his own plan to combat the crisis while condemning what he called Mr. Trump’s “colossal” failure to guarantee citizens access to coronavirus testing.For Mr. Trump, the perception that he is a strong leader has been central to his appeal since the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign. Gallup regularly asks Americans about their feelings about the president on a range of personal qualities. Out of the seven qualities Gallup tests, only one applies to Mr. Trump in the eyes of a majority of Americans: being a strong and decisive leader. When Mr. Biden attacks him over the coronavirus, he is taking a cut at Americans’ view of Mr. Trump as a forceful leader.But the virus may have an effect on Mr. Trump’s public approval in ways that ripple far beyond his direct response to the crisis — particularly as the economy absorbs the severe impact of the virus.Before the outbreak, Americans were more likely to describe themselves as satisfied with the way things were going in the country than at any point in the past 15 years, according to Gallup polling. Mr. Trump’s approval ratings have been in the mid- to high 40s in recent months — among the highest numbers of his presidency — lifted by the thriving economy.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Friday to drastically speed up coronavirus testing, approving a commercial test that will allow many labs around the country to begin processing as many as 4,000 samples a day, and introducing an emergency hotline for laboratories.The administration also announced new partnerships with companies developing tests that can detect the virus within an hour.The Food and Drug Administration enlisted Roche, a Swiss health care giant, in the testing effort, giving the global drug manufacturer emergency permission to sell to labs the first commercially approved test for the coronavirus in the United States.

That should help expand the scope and speed of coronavirus screening. Combined, the moves signaled the federal government was rushing to catch up with overwhelming demand for more testing capacity, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbed and hospitals began to be stretched thin by surges in patients. As of Friday morning, there were at least 1,660 cases of coronavirus confirmed by lab tests and 41 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The global death toll topped 5,000. Combined, the moves signaled the federal government was rushing to catch up with overwhelming demand for more testing capacity, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbed and hospitals began to be stretched thin by surges in patients. As of Friday morning, there were at least 1,660 cases of coronavirus confirmed by lab tests and 41 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The global death toll topped 5,000. The approval of the Roche test means that labs that already have the company’s high-capacity testing equipment — which are widely available in the United States and around the world — will quickly be able to test for the virus. Roche said its commercial test will provide results in three and a half hours. One of its systems, the cobas 8800 System, will be able to test 4,128 samples in 24 hours. Another system, the cobas 6800 System, can run 1,440 tests in 24 hours.The F.D.A. has been criticized by lab directors and public health officials for moving too slowly to allow outside companies and academic labs to develop their own tests for the virus, even as other countries, such as South Korea, have quickly ramped up their testing.
“These actions today show our commitment to working around the clock to help expedite the availability of tests,” said Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, in a statement.Roche said it was ramping up its manufacturing to meet what it expects will be global demand. Several other testing companies, including Hologic and Cepheid, have also said they were developing commercial tests for the virus. “Providing quality, high-volume testing capabilities will allow us to respond effectively to what the World Health Organization has characterized as a pandemic. It is important to quickly and reliably detect whether a patient is infected with SARS-CoV-2,” Dr. Thomas Schinecker, chief executive of Roche Diagnostics, said in a statement, using the scientific name for the novel coronavirus.Under pressure from Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the F.D.A. also on Friday granted New York State’s public health department the authority to allow other labs in the state to conduct tests, without having to go through the federal agency.The F.D.A. said a 24-hour emergency hotline would be created to help private and academic labs process and validate tests, and President Trump announced that he would hold a 3 p.m. news conference to discuss his administration’s response to the virus.The news of Roche’s participation came as the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would award over a million dollars to two other companies, DiaSorin Molecular and Qiagen, to speed up the development of one-hour tests. The tests mark a potentially significant overhaul of the current federal diagnostic model, which requires swabs from patients be sent to laboratories for testing. That takes hours at a minimum.Doctors have been clamoring for “point-of-care” coronavirus tests allowing results to be produced where patients are received, similar to how people are tested for the flu or strep throat.“We are working with the private sector at an urgent pace to make these tests available on as many diagnostic platforms as we can in the coming weeks,” Rick A. Bright, the director of the biomedical research unit at Health and Human Services, said in a statement.The agency also made drastic changes to the team overseeing the distribution of tests to public and private labs, installing Adm.

"BEIJING — China is pushing a new theory about the origins of the coronavirus: It is an American disease that might have been introduced by members of the United States Army who visited Wuhan in October.There is not a shred of evidence to support that, but the notion received an official endorsement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose spokesman accused American officials of not coming clean about what they know about the disease.The intentional spreading of an unfounded conspiracy theory — which recirculated on China’s tightly controlled internet on Friday — punctuated a downward spiral in relations between the two countries that has been fueled by the basest instinct of officials on both sides.The insinuation came in a series of posts on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman who has made good use of the platform, which is blocked in China, to push a newly aggressive, and hawkish, diplomatic strategy.

Trump School of Diplomacy,” added Mr. Gewirtz, who recently published a paper on China’s handling of the AIDS epidemic, after a similar disinformation campaign. “This small cadre of high-volume Chinese officials don’t seem to realize that peddling conspiracy theories is totally self-defeating for China, at a moment when it wants to be seen as a positive contributor around the world.” “There are a few Chinese officials who appear to have gone to the Donald J.

Last year, Beijing explicitly accused the American government of supporting public protests in Hong Kong in an effort to weaken the party’s rule. The old tactic has been amplified by more combative public diplomacy and a new embrace of a social media platform that is blocked in China to spread a message abroad.
Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California at San Diego who studies Chinese politics, said that while the campaign was very likely an attempt to distract and deflect blame, a more worrisome possibility was that some officials fabricated the idea and persuaded top leaders to believe it.“If the leadership really believes in the culpability of the U.S. government,” he warned, “it may behave in a way that dramatically worsens the bilateral relationship.”China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has faced sharp criticism for the government’s initial handling of the outbreak, even at home. Public anger erupted in February when a doctor who was punished for warning his colleagues about the coronavirus died, prompting censors to redouble their efforts to stifle public criticism. Chinese officials have repeatedly urged officials in other countries not to politicize what is a public health emergency. Conservatives in the United States, in particular, have latched on to loaded terms that have been criticized for stigmatizing the Chinese people. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the “Wuhan virus,” while Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, called it the “Chinese coronavirus.” Chinese officials have repeatedly urged officials in other countries not to politicize what is a public health emergency.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the “Wuhan virus,” while Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, called it the “Chinese coronavirus.” In response, Chinese officials and state news media have stepped up their criticism of American officials’ comments.Only days before Mr. Zhao’s latest post, the Xinhua news agency published a commentary denouncing “Washington’s poisonous coronavirus politics” and warning that spreading rumors simply encouraged “fear, division and hate.”“Their dangerously irresponsible statements are highly counterproductive at this drastic hour that demands solidarity and cooperation,” the commentary, written by Gao Wencheng, said, “and could be much more menacing than the virus itself.”The coronavirus, according to all evidence, emanated from Wuhan, China, in late December. Scientists have not yet identified a “patient zero” or a precise source of the virus, though preliminary studies have linked it to a virus in bats that passed through another mammal before infecting humans.A senior official of China’s National Health Commission, Liang Wannian, said at a briefing in Beijing last month that the likely carrier was a pangolin, an endangered species that is trafficked almost exclusively to China for its meat and for its scales, which are prized for use in traditional medicine.The first cluster of patients was reported at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and studies have since suggested that the virus could have been introduced there by someone already infected. Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei account for the overwhelming amount of cases and deaths, so there is no scientific reason to believe the virus began elsewhere.Mr. Zhao’s assertion began with a post linking to a video of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert R. Redfield, testifying before the House on Wednesday and suggesting that some flu deaths might have been caused by the coronavirus.

Sanders declared that the crisis “is on a scale of a major war” and argued that “we must act accordingly.” Biden faulted the president’s “adversarial relationship with the truth” and outlined his own multipronged plan for confronting the crisis. He proposed expanding access to free virus testing, helping to increase hospital capacity and speeding up the push for a vaccine.The pandemic has the potential to damage Trump in more than one way. First of all, even as his approval ratings have remained underwater, perceptions that Trump is a strong leader have offered him some safe harbor. Gallup regularly asks Americans for their opinions of the president on a range of personal qualities; the strength of his leadership is the only one on which he consistently receives positive marks.And with the virus sending the stock market into free fall, the country’s thriving economy could soon find itself in a recession. Trump generally gets a positive review from most Americans for his handling of the economy; if the economic picture were to go dark, he could be deprived of one of his major talking points as the 2020 campaign revs up.Trump is working with Congress to craft legislation that will confront both the virus’s economic fallout and national health concerns. As of Thursday night, those negotiations hadn’t yet been resolved. For more on where things stand, scroll down for a dispatch from our Washington correspondent Emily Cochrane.The Democratic presidential debate scheduled for this Sunday has been moved from Arizona to Washington amid concerns over — you guessed it —  the coronavirus. The debate, which will be hosted by CNN, will take place without a live audience.For the president, the coronavirus is starting to hit close to home. A Brazilian official tested positive soon after meeting last week at Mar-a-Lago with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. That official was part of a delegation led by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was subsequently tested and is awaiting his results. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Trump and Pence had no plans to get tested, adding that they “had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive.”Biden needs to scale up his operation, and to do so, he has hired a new campaign manager: Jennifer O’Malley Dillon. She was the manager of Beto O’Rourke’s short-lived presidential campaign last year; before that, she was a senior aide on Barack Obama’s re-election team in 2012.

Michigan’s results were great for Biden — and maybe ominous signs for Trump. No state serves as a better metaphor for the 2016 election than Michigan.Long considered a safe Democratic stronghold, it broke for Trump by just 10,000 votes, contributing to Hillary Clinton’s Electoral College defeat. Clinton underperformed in a range of crucial areas, including with rural voters — who broke for Trump — and African-Americans, who went heavily for Clinton, as expected, but turned out in relatively low numbers. Biden’s win in the Michigan primary this week suggests that something quite different could be in store come November. In what ended up being a warning sign of things to come, Clinton narrowly lost the 2016 Democratic primary there to Sanders. But on Tuesday, Biden trounced Sanders and drew strong support from a broad coalition of voters, including college-educated white women, moderates and those over 45. Just as significant, the primary crushed past Democratic turnout records in the state by more than 30 percent.In a new article, our reporters Trip Gabriel and Stephanie Saul examined what the results could mean for the general election if Biden were to become the nominee. “In a state like Michigan, when you have a record turnout coming — and I think we do in November — that is a huge benefit to the Democratic nominee,” Richard Czuba, a nonpartisan Michigan pollster, told Trip and Stephanie. “There just aren’t enough Republicans in Michigan.” Just as significant, the primary crushed past Democratic turnout records in the state by more than 30 percent.In a new article, our reporters Trip Gabriel and Stephanie Saul examined what the results could mean for the general election if Biden were to become the nominee. “In a state like Michigan, when you have a record turnout coming — and I think we do in November — that is a huge benefit to the Democratic nominee,” Richard Czuba, a nonpartisan Michigan pollster, told Trip and Stephanie. “There just aren’t enough Republicans in Michigan.” On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

"WASHINGTON — As thousands of Americans flee from Europe and other centers of the coronavirus outbreak, many travelers are reporting no health screenings upon departure and few impediments at U.S. airports beyond a welcome home greeting.Since January, officers from Customs and Border Protection have been on heightened alert for travelers who could potentially spread the virus. The Department of Homeland Security has told employees to look for visible physical symptoms and search through their travel documents and a federal database that tracks where they came from. Those customs officers will soon have to spot symptoms among a flood of more Americans funneled to designated airports from multiple countries in Europe, an administration official said, after President Trump announced new travel restrictions on the region this week.But travelers, including some who say they showed visible signs of illness, say screening has been lax. Members of Congress this week grilled senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security over what some described as a porous screening process. And customs officers at airports question how accurately they can pinpoint people with symptoms and what safeguards are being taken to protect their health.Even top officials at the department acknowledge the task of sealing the United States from the virus is impossible. WASHINGTON — As thousands of Americans flee from Europe and other centers of the coronavirus outbreak, many travelers are reporting no health screenings upon departure and few impediments at U.S. airports beyond a welcome home greeting.Since January, officers from Customs and Border Protection have been on heightened alert for travelers who could potentially spread the virus.

And customs officers at airports question how accurately they can pinpoint people with symptoms and what safeguards are being taken to protect their health.Even top officials at the department acknowledge the task of sealing the United States from the virus is impossible. “This has never been from Day 1 intended to be a hermetically sealed process,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security. “We are trying to reduce and delay the biggest peak in the virus wave hitting on the United States of America. And all of these steps reduce and delay. They do not stop of the virus.”“Viruses do not care about boundaries,” he said.Maggie McDow, 46, said she had swollen glands when she landed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, one of 11 airports where travelers who have recently been in China or Iran are being funneled. Ms. McDow had flown from London, but before that, she had stopped in South Korea, a coronavirus hot spot.Ms. McDow said she heard plenty of instructions from airport officials for those feeling ill in airports abroad. But when she reached the United States, she said, “There was none of that.” A customs officer stamped her passport, and she was on her way.
“No one asked where I had traveled. I guess they just assumed we all were just coming from London and so no big deal,” Ms. McDow wrote in an email because she was too sick to speak on the phone and has yet to be tested for the coronavirus. “I could have been coughing and feverish, and it seemed no one would have batted an eye.” The Trump administration has barred entry to foreigners who in the past 14 days have visited China, Iran, and beginning at 11:59 p.m. Friday, 26 countries in the European Union. The administration has also told customs officers to use the federal travel database, documents and interviews with travelers to determine who to refer to a health screening at the airport. Officers are also required to refer those with symptoms coming from South Korea or Italy to be screened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Stephanie Malin, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection.

Officers are also required to refer those with symptoms coming from South Korea or Italy to be screened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Stephanie Malin, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection. Ms. Malin said that as of March 4, more than 63,000 travelers at airports, seaports and the land border had been referred by a Customs and Border Protection officer for a health screening. Mr. Cuccinelli said last week at a Senate homeland security hearing that the screenings had been successful at slowing the outbreak.“It bought us time,” Mr. Cuccinelli said.The crush of Americans returning from Europe will make those screenings that much harder.Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents officers from the section of Customs and Border Protection that conducts screening at airports in the United States, said officers were concerned about travelers not being truthful, or not knowing, about their symptoms.“They are worried about the imprecise distinctions on when travelers may be contagious,” Mr. Reardon said. “They are also worried about whether all passengers who are at risk based on their travel history are being properly flagged for screening.”“C.B.P.’s highest priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families and we are taking every available precaution to protect our work force,” said Nathan Peeters, a spokesman for the agency.Three security screeners with the Transportation Security Administration at a Northern California airport have tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said this week. Two medical contractors employed by the Homeland Security Department also learned last week that they had the virus. The department closed a field office in Washington State for two weeks this month after an employee contracted the disease.

Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, sent a letter to the C.D.C. demanding it clarify what airport screening was being given to travelers coming from South Korea and Italy.

It was unclear whether she was referring to Mr. Pompeo. Ms. Tice declined through a spokesman to comment.Critics have accused the Trump administration of missing opportunities to win Mr. Tice’s release. It has made concessions to the Assad government without demanding Mr. Tice’s release or anything else in return, including when administration officials announced in 2017 that they would no longer pursue Mr. Assad’s ouster, and again last year when Mr. Trump abruptly pulled back American forces fighting the Islamic State, essentially giving up much of the land in Syria that the military had seized from the group back to Mr. Assad’s government.Mr. Frerichs’s case is similarly caught up in delicate geopolitical negotiations.

Some officials expressed concern that if Mr. Frerichs is not found quickly, he could be smuggled into Pakistan, making a rescue by American commandos more difficult because of the political sensitivities and potentially treacherous terrain.

"SAN FRANCISCO — The Defense Department said on Thursday that it would re-evaluate the awarding of a $10 billion cloud computing contract to Microsoft after sustained protest from Amazon, which had contended that it lost the deal because of potential interference from President Trump.In a legal brief filed to the Court of Federal Claims, the Justice Department requested the reconsideration after Amazon argued in federal court that its offerings and pricing had been incorrectly assessed by the Pentagon. The Defense Department requested 120 days to reassess the award. The judge in the case, Patricia E. Campbell-Smith, is expected to allow the re-evaluation to go forward, though she has not yet made an official ruling.The reconsideration is the latest twist in the enormous contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, which was considered to be a prize for technology companies.Amazon, a cloud computing giant, had widely been considered the front-runner to win the contract before it was awarded to Microsoft in October. Amazon then pushed to overturn the decision, arguing that President Trump interfered because of his dispute with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post.

Amazon then pushed to overturn the decision, arguing that President Trump interfered because of his dispute with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post. The Washington Post has aggressively covered the Trump administration. Doug Stone, an Amazon spokesman, said in a statement on Thursday that the company was “pleased that the D.O.D. has acknowledged ‘substantial and legitimate’ issues that affected the JEDI award decision, and that corrective action is necessary.” He added that Amazon looked forward to action “that fully insulates the re-evaluation from political influence and corrects the many issues affecting the initial flawed award.”Still, the decision does not represent a full victory for Amazon, and the Justice Department said in a court filing that the company would oppose the motion to reconsider the contract award. The motion was based on the issue of pricing, and not whether Mr. Trump interfered with the process.A spokesman for the Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We believe the Department of Defense made the correct decision when they awarded the contract,” said Frank X. Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, adding that the company remains confident that its proposal “is the right choice for the D.O.D.”The Pentagon’s rapid change of position raises the question of whether it suddenly found merit in Amazon’s objections, or whether officials feared that the court action challenging the award would inevitably surface emails or memorandums suggesting Mr. Trump interfered in the selection.But a Defense Department official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the filing would force Amazon to prove the allegations of bias it has leveled against Mr. Trump — a difficult legal challenge.

Although Amazon has sought to depose Mr. Trump and senior Defense Department officials to fight against the award to Microsoft, its legal arguments challenging the way the contract was awarded have focused on how the Defense Department did not accurately assess the way that it would be charged for certain services.In February, Judge Campbell-Smith sided with Amazon on the pricing issue, issuing a temporary injunction that prevented Microsoft from continuing to work with the Defense Department on the contract.The back-and-forth has put the Pentagon in an awkward spot. Last month, speaking to reporters at the Munich Security Conference, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper argued that it was time to abandon challenges and move ahead with building the cloud. Time was of the essence, he said, and American national security was on the line.“It’s important to the war-fighters that we move forward on this contract,” he said. “We have to move forward. It’s gone on too long.”When asked whether he was pressured on who could receive the $10 billion contract, Mr. Esper said, “Look, I’m not going to get into that part, because I don’t talk about my discussions with the president and White House officials.”He said he educated himself about the Pentagon’s transition to the cloud when he took office last year and said he “heard a lot” about the competition to build it, particularly on Capitol Hill, before ultimately recusing himself from the decision over the award because his son works at IBM, one of the companies that bid on the contract.But when a reporter pointed out he had left open the possibility of pressure from Mr. Trump or other aides, he said: “I never felt pressure from the White House.”Kate Conger reported from San Francisco and David E.

But now, instead of watching the president create drama on cable television from a faraway capital, millions are living it themselves. Like me, they’re facing school closures, travel limitations and an economy gyrating with uncertainty. And, in the midst of it all, there is a presidential election, one in which the ability of the candidates to engage with the public — the most fundamental aspect of politicking — is being thrown into question.Candidates like to talk about that 3 a.m. phone call, that split second when their resolve would be tested.That moment is now. The campaign we’ve all followed for months is over; something very different and deeply unpredictable is beginning.“We are in a time and place where uncertainty is the norm and uncertain events can change the direction of the race on a dime,” said Robby Mook, who ran Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. “The tables can turn quickly.”Over the past 18 hours, we’ve gotten a preview of our new politics. Last night, the country watched President Trump deliver a monotone Oval Office address, only to have various administration officials quickly step in to correct several policies that he had announced.

Last night, the country watched President Trump deliver a monotone Oval Office address, only to have various administration officials quickly step in to correct several policies that he had announced. Today brought addresses from former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, who offered their prescriptions for the pandemic as they tried to exude somber leadership. But even their speeches underscored the extraordinary situation.
While their words echoed the tone of presidents in moments of crisis, they delivered their remarks before small groups of reporters in drab hotel ballrooms — not at the kinds of large rallies that typically happen at this stage of a campaign.The missing rallies are far from the only unusual political dynamic. At least nine members of Congress have self-quarantined after exposure to the virus, including several who had interactions with the president. State party conventions, where delegates to the national convention are selected, have been canceled. The Democratic debate on Sunday will take place without an audience in Washington, as Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders close campaign offices and instruct staffers to work from home. And state officials are scrambling to move voting places out of nursing homes before next Tuesday’s primaries.Even the candidates’ personal health is an issue: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified Americans over age 60 as a high-risk group, recommending they “avoid crowds as much as possible” during an outbreak. All three men running for president are in their 70s. Despite it all, someone must still win the election and Democrats see the politics as trending in their favor. Mr. Trump has yoked the success of his presidency to the economy and, more specifically, the stock market, which has plummeted with alarming speed over the past week or so.It’s impossible to know if their instinct is correct. When it comes to the administration’s response, the relative consensus that might usually accompany a national crisis is nowhere to be found. Nearly nine in 10 Republican voters approved of the president’s response to the virus, according to a Quinnipiac poll released this week. Just one in 10 Democratic voters agreed.

As I’ve watched the spread of the virus, I’ve struggled to think of an analogous political moment in recent American history.A war, perhaps? Not quite, since schools were open and social contact was allowed. Or maybe the period after 9/11? Except then, the enemy was more clear — not invisibly lurking on dirty hands and airline trays.The political questions we face today have similar life-or-death stakes but the impact is so much more intimate for so many of us, even when it comes to the basic mechanisms of modern campaigning. How do you knock on doors? Organize staff in a war room? Can you elbow-bump a baby?Like the politicians themselves, we’re all stumbling our way through a scary new coronavirus-infected world.

Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com.From Opinion: What will Bernie Sanders do? With his Tuesday night loss in Michigan — a primary he won in 2016 — Senator Bernie Sanders faces pressure to drop out of the race and support the Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.Yet there aren’t many signs Mr. Sanders plans to do so just yet. “It’s not my style to give up,” he told Elizabeth Bruenig this week in Michigan. “I was born with a lot of endurance.” But supporters of Mr. Sanders are taking stock of their candidate, who performed well in the early contests but has since fizzled.“Instead of the Bernie Sanders Revolution,” Michelle Cottle says that Democrats “are opting for the Joe Biden Cuddle, embracing a candidate who is peddling reassurance, unity, moderation, empathy and civility.” And now that Mr. Sanders is most likely on his way out, writes Cottle, “many Democrats are understandably nervous. Mr. Sanders has never been an especially gracious competitor.”The nomination of Mr. Biden would feel as though “the Democratic establishment has successfully marginalized the progressive left,” writes Jamelle Bouie.

"WASHINGTON — As fears mounted this week about the rapid spread of the coronavirus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi swatted away the suggestion of shuttering Congress with a stoic declaration: “We are the captains of the ship. We are the last to leave.”But by Thursday, as the captains of the ship and their crew saw warning signs blinking from the lighthouse — constituents sickened, colleagues quarantining themselves, grim reports about the virulence of the disease — they began to worry that they were in a different kind of vessel.“Members of Congress,” Representative Matt Gaetz said on the House floor, wearing a gas mask for emphasis, “are human petri dishes.”In a cement and marble Capitol complex teeming with tourists, lawmakers and staff members, anxiety around the coronavirus outbreak — the grim, shuddering after realizing you just touched that constituent’s folder and then touched your face type of anxiety — has at last arrived.

Days after his gas-mask-donning stunt, Mr. Gaetz, Republican of Florida, quarantined himself as he traveled with President Trump on Air Force One, after learning that he had had contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus at a conservative political conference outside Washington.Thursday was the day the dam appeared to break. Two Senate aides tested positive for the virus. Offices began to close in waves. And two more Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rick Scott of Florida, chose to go into quarantine. The sergeant-at-arms announced that the Capitol and surrounding office buildings would shut down to visitors. A Democratic congressman’s spokesman announced that his boss, who was exposed to someone who tested positive for the virus, was unable to get a test. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, directed her aides to work from home.“We’re all having a real conversation about the realness of the situation,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, before assuring a reporter, almost as an afterthought: “But don’t panic!” Days after his gas-mask-donning stunt, Mr. Gaetz, Republican of Florida, quarantined himself as he traveled with President Trump on Air Force One, after learning that he had had contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus at a conservative political conference outside Washington.Thursday was the day the dam appeared to break.

On Capitol Hill, while members of Congress have taken pains to present a calm front, a newfound sense of dread has quietly set in — as much among senior lawmakers as among low-ranking staff aides — manifesting alternately as manic denial and gallows humor. The temptation to do so, however, has only increased as the outbreak continues to spread and more and more institutions take proactive measures to contain it. On Capitol Hill, while members of Congress have taken pains to present a calm front, a newfound sense of dread has quietly set in — as much among senior lawmakers as among low-ranking staff aides — manifesting alternately as manic denial and gallows humor. “Don’t touch me!” Senator Pat Roberts, an 83-year-old Republican from Kansas, ordered when he was approached by a reporter off the Senate floor.

Many college-age interns in the House were recalled home by their universities this week, leaving offices stranded during appropriations season, a time when they are normally dispatched to visit hundreds of offices to collect lawmakers’ signatures on official funding requests. In the case of one House office, instead of interns, lower-level aides wearing masks and gloves were sent to collect the signatures.Lawmakers up for re-election privately discussed how they would handle campaigning. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said he had planned to knock on doors on Saturday, but canceled the outing after consulting with his campaign staff.“We were debating, do people want me knocking on their door?” Mr. Coons said.Ms. Pelosi discouraged reporters from bumping elbows as a greeting.“Forget any physical contact,” she said.That is easier said than done in the Capitol, where the coronavirus has created something of a perfect storm. Congress is home to dozens of elderly lawmakers whose sheer age puts them at higher risk, not to mention the fact that they routinely work long hours; crisscross the country by plane; meet with a constantly rotating cast of constituents, lobbyists, donors and experts from around the world; and are by nature eager to shake every hand they see.Then there are their aides, who work on their committees and in their offices and meet with even more people than their bosses do, running reports and memos back and forth to other aides in other offices. It is an entire network of thousands of Type A personalities guided by a belief that they can reason, spin, flatter or glad-hand their way out of any and all problems. And it is all best done face to face, not at a distance.On Thursday, Senate pages could be seen wiping down desks and chairs on the floor, and behind the scenes, enterprising aides bartered their offices’ snacks for hand sanitizer. House administrators have ordered 1,500 new laptops before what could be a crush of demands for technology products as congressional offices begin urging staff members to work from home, according to one Democratic aide familiar with the order. There were islands of nonchalance — perhaps alarming under the circumstances — amid the worrying. A reporter standing in a hallway just off the Senate floor coughed openly into the air just as a member of the Senate leadership walked by unawares. Hordes of reporters swarmed septuagenarian senators with gusto to grab quotes, standing in sprawling scrums just inches away from one another and the lawmakers they sought out.

He said his plan would speed the ability of Americans to be tested for the virus. It includes private partnerships to speed tests to the market and a website designed by Google, where Mr. Trump said potential patients could enter their symptoms and be directed to a drive-through testing center. The president said the site would be available starting on Sunday, with the goal of allowing all Americans who needed a test to get one “very safely, quickly and conveniently.” He said his plan would speed the ability of Americans to be tested for the virus.

The president said the site would be available starting on Sunday, with the goal of allowing all Americans who needed a test to get one “very safely, quickly and conveniently.” But later, Google appeared to cast doubt on when or even whether that would be possible. A spokeswoman said that the initiative was in its “early stages” and would first be introduced as a prototype in the Bay Area.The president, who has claimed that anyone who wanted a test could get one, also deflected any blame for the testing delays that have hampered the government’s response.“I don’t take responsibility at all,” Mr. Trump said.He brushed off questions about his own possible exposure to the virus. A Brazilian official who visited him last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has since tested positive, but Mr. Trump said he had no symptoms and did not need to be tested. When repeatedly pressed on the matter, he said he was likely to be screened. “Fairly soon,” he said. “We’re working out a schedule.” But later, Google appeared to cast doubt on when or even whether that would be possible.

Conley, said testing was “not currently indicated.”The relief deal, whose cost is unclear, would allow for two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave for those affected by the crisis.It provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit. It does not include the payroll tax suspension that Mr. Trump wants. Any such suspension could cost more than $800 billion and would not provide help to workers who lose their jobs or stop drawing salaries in the outbreak.
“We could have passed our bill yesterday,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “But we thought it would be important to show the American people — to assure the American people — that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them.”The announcements came as the pandemic’s ripple effects further slowed critical sectors of the American economy and interfered with daily life.Schools across the country, including in Los Angeles and the entire state of Virginia, shut down. Delta Air Lines announced it would ground 300 aircraft and reduce capacity by 40 percent, the sharpest cutback in its history. Grocery store shelves were picked clean, and restaurants and retail stores braced for fall-offs in customer traffic as more Americans began to follow “social distancing” orders to avoid crowds and possible virus transmission.The House voted overwhelmingly to approve the aid bill, which was unveiled minutes before midnight and passed 363 to 40 at 12:53 a.m. Saturday. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, the chamber’s lone independent, voted present.The bill includes enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing and additional funds for food assistance and Medicaid. Senators, who left Washington for the weekend on Thursday, are expected to take up the measure when they return next week. Mr. Trump has signed off on it. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in a statement after the vote that “senators will need to carefully review” the bill passed by the House.“But I believe the vast majority of senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers, families and small businesses,” he said.

The shape of the paid leave benefit — and how many workers could have access to it — proved to be a sticking point in negotiations on Friday between Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Democrats agreed to drop a provision that would have created a permanent paid sick leave entitlement in case of a public health emergency. Republicans sought to confine it only to people who were sick or caring for ill family or children kept out of school.Ms. Pelosi characterized the bill on Friday evening as an intermediate step.“As the Senate works to pass this bill,” she wrote in a letter to colleagues, “the House will begin work on a third emergency response package to protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.”In Europe, officials announced a series of aggressive measures to support their economies and try to contain the virus’s spread.

Mr. Trump’s moves and the aid bill was considered progress in the effort to slow the virus’s spread and minimize damage to the economy.But they still fell far short of the steps that many economists say lawmakers must take to confront a crisis with little precedent in American history — one that is likely to require Mr. Trump to marshal a rapid bipartisan response.His difficulty in doing so was evident on Friday. Shortly after stock trading closed for the day, the president cast doubt on the aid package that had been negotiated painstakingly by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin.

Shortly after stock trading closed for the day, the president cast doubt on the aid package that had been negotiated painstakingly by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin. “We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough” in negotiations, he said.

Still, talks continued as the afternoon progressed. As Mr. Trump was criticizing Democrats, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin were speaking for the 10th time of the day about the legislation. Ms. Pelosi announced the deal after they concluded their 13th call, and shortly after Mr. Mnuchin met privately with the president to urge him to accept it.In the hours after that, the deal seemed in peril as White House officials insisted they were still reviewing text and aides rushed to make technical changes.“Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” Mr. Trump tweeted just before 9 p.m., giving the first indication that he backed the measure and wanted Republicans to vote for it.Any delay could further imperil an economy that many forecasters are persuaded is entering a recession, caused by the damage the virus has already inflicted on global supply chains and the growing chill from homebound consumers pulling back on their spending.

Some economists say that to contain the spread of the virus, the country must effectively hit pause on entire sectors of commerce, like entertainment and dining, that bring Americans together in large crowds. Those economists say Congress and Mr. Trump must help workers and small-business owners weather that shock — and give them enough cash to help kick-start spending and hiring again once the virus is contained and daily routines begin to return to normal.“The approach has to be, let’s make this as short and sharp as we can,” said Steven Hamilton, an economist at George Washington University who has recently called for policymakers to rethink traditional government stimulus efforts that focus largely on tax cuts or spending programs, and instead supply hundreds of billions of dollars in direct assistance to workers and small business owners.

The United States economy is going to need to shut — I mean, shut everything — for two to six weeks.”That sort of abrupt halt in activity will particularly hurt small-business owners who lack the cash reserves or access to credit that larger companies enjoy. It will also slam lower-income workers, many of whom do not have paid leave, or work in industries like hospitality that are suffering acutely from the pandemic — or both.By limiting the number of people gathering in common spaces, traveling by public transit systems, and coming into direct contact with one another, it may be possible to substantially slow the spread of the virus, experts say.Studies of cities and states that have required employers to offer paid sick leave show substantially lower rates of influenza during flu season, a sign that the provision does reduce the spread of illness. Many economists, including conservatives and liberals, applauded the inclusion of a paid leave provision in the House bill.“Good economic policy starts by ensuring that the humans in the economy stay well — and alive — so they can participate in the economy as both producers and consumers,” said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality and growth. “We need to focus on this basic first principle right now.” “It’s the worst public health crisis in a century,” Mr. Hamilton said. “The world has never faced anything like this.

Mr. Trump sent mixed messages in his news conference about the size of the economic impact he was expecting, and about the steps Americans should take to avoid contracting or transmitting the virus.He called upon Americans to make “short-term sacrifices” like avoiding large gatherings and postponing business travel, and he warned that the next eight weeks would be critical for slowing the spread of the virus.“This will pass through,” Mr. Trump said, “and we’re going to be even stronger for it.”Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Nicholas Fandos, Maggie Haberman, Margot Sanger-Katz, Jeanna Smialek, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Alan Rappeport.

"As he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump attempted to deflect criticisms of his administration’s response to the virus with inaccurate claims. Here’s a fact-check.what the facts areMr. Trump wrongly blamed the Obama administration for coronavirus testing shortages and falsely said it “didn’t do testing” during the swine flu epidemic of 2009.What Mr. Trump Said“I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time.”False. The Food and Drug Administration issued a “draft guidance” in 2014 in which it sought to extend its authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests. But it’s wrong to blame that effort for the scattered and insufficient delivery of coronavirus tests as the guidance was not particularly relevant to emergency situations and was never finalized or generally enforced.A law enacted in 2004 created the process and requirements for the use of unapproved products in public health emergencies. Under the law and guidance set by the Trump administration itself, the Food and Drug Administration requires developers of laboratory-developed tests to submit information and to comply with certain procedures.

Under the law and guidance set by the Trump administration itself, the Food and Drug Administration requires developers of laboratory-developed tests to submit information and to comply with certain procedures. The agency said in early March that it would permit unapproved tests for the coronavirus for 15 days while developers are preparing their emergency authorization request. Neither the 2004 law nor subsequent amendments restricted the Trump administration from doing so, nor did it hamper previous administrations in fast-tracking testing for other health crises.What Mr. Trump Said“If you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t do testing like this, and actually they lost approximately 14,000 people, and they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late.”False. This is blatantly wrong. Diagnostic tests for the swine flu were approved and shipped out less than two weeks after the H1N1 virus was identified and a day before the first death in the United States.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the first case of the virus on April 14, 2009. The Obama administration declared swine flu a public health emergency on April 26. The Food and Drug Administration approved a rapid test for the virus two days later. At the time, the C.D.C. had reported 64 cases and zero deaths. The C.D.C. began shipping test kits to public health laboratories on May 1 (at 141 cases and one death) and a second test was approved in July. From May to September 2009, the agency shipped more than 1,000 kits, each one able to test 1,000 specimens.To be sure, researchers found flaws and limitations in the tests but testing was conducted. A vaccine became available in early October but, amid reports of shortages, President Obama declared the outbreak a national emergency later that month. The estimated death toll in the United States from the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010. What the Facts AreMr. Trump inaccurately described a website in development to mitigate the outbreak.What Mr. Trump Said“I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website, it’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”This is misleading. Mr. Trump misstated the company developing the website and exaggerated its scope. After Mr. Trump spoke, Google issued a statement on Twitter from Verily, a separate subsidiary of Google’s parent company.“We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,” the statement read.A spokeswoman for Verily said it had originally intended for the website to be used only by health care workers. Mr. Trump’s statement prompted the company to make it available to the public. The site will direct people to “pilot sites” for testing in the Bay Area, the spokeswoman said. If the pilot goes well, Verily aims to deploy the project nationwide, but there is no timetable for a national rollout.what the facts areMr. Trump again mischaracterized travel restrictions imposed on certain European countries.What Mr. Trump Said“As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now and we closed that border a while ago.”This is misleading. Mr. Trump imposed some travel restrictions on 26 European countries on Wednesday night, but those restrictions do not go into effect until midnight on Friday and do not amount to a total shutting down of the border.The restrictions bar the entry of foreign nationals who have been to any of the 26 countries that make up Europe’s Schengen Area of open borders within 14 days. That area does not include more than 20 other European countries, including Britain. The proclamation also does not apply to American citizens, permanent residents, their immediate families, or those who are members of air or sea crews.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded access to telehealth services — for example, virtual check-ins and telephone consultations with doctors — for Medicare beneficiaries this week. But these technologies have been in use since the 1960s.The University of Nebraska used video links to provide exams and diagnoses with a state hospital 112 miles in 1964. Three years later, the University of Miami and a local fire department transmitted cardiac rhythms using radio channels. Federal agencies initiated a host of other services in the 1970s and 1980s.A 1997 government report noted a severely injured sailor aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln was able to be treated by a doctor in San Diego 6,000 miles away through telemedicine. By 2014, “more than 20 federal agencies were engaged in some aspect of telehealth,” according to the Congressional Research Service, with the Department of Veterans Affairs providing more than 2.1 million telehealth consultations in the 2015 fiscal year.what the facts areMr. Trump said he was not responsible for disbanding the White House’s pandemic team.what Mr. Trump said“When you say me, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could ask — perhaps my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it.”This is misleading. The top White House official tasked with leading the country’s response to a pandemic left the administration in May 2018 and his team was disbanded by Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at the time, John R. Bolton, The Washington Post has reported.While there is no evidence that Mr. Trump personally directed the ousting of these officials, he also did not replace them in the nearly two years since, despite repeated bipartisan urgings from lawmakers and experts. what the facts areMr. Trump described telemedicine technology as “fairly new,” though it’s been used for decades.What Mr. Trump Said“This includes the following critical authorities — the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that has happened in the not-so-distant past.”This is exaggerated.

Interest rates will be temporarily waived for borrowers, but their monthly payments will not actually decrease, according to a Department of Education spokeswoman. Instead, borrowers’ full payments will go toward the principal on their loans.The waiver also does not cover student loans issued through state agencies, big private lenders, a majority of Federal Family Education Loans or school-held Perkins loans.Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

"WASHINGTON — There was one big question looming on Friday over the Rose Garden, where President Trump held an afternoon news conference and announced new emergency measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.As Mr. Trump introduced a line of chief executives and public health officials, praising their efforts and those of his administration, the mystery was the president’s own health. Would Mr. Trump, 73, be tested after interacting with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after meeting with him in Florida?On an issue that seemed cut and dry, yes or no, Mr. Trump hedged.First he insisted that he did not have any symptoms, and noted that getting tested might set a bad example. “We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test,” he said.Then a reporter questioned whether Mr. Trump was disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S.

WASHINGTON — There was one big question looming on Friday over the Rose Garden, where President Trump held an afternoon news conference and announced new emergency measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.As Mr. Trump introduced a line of chief executives and public health officials, praising their efforts and those of his administration, the mystery was the president’s own health. Would Mr. Trump, 73, be tested after interacting with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after meeting with him in Florida?On an issue that seemed cut and dry, yes or no, Mr. Trump hedged.First he insisted that he did not have any symptoms, and noted that getting tested might set a bad example. “We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test,” he said.Then a reporter questioned whether Mr. Trump was disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the public health official standing directly to his right, who has recommended tests and self-quarantining for anyone who stood next to someone who had tested positive. “I think they shouldn’t be jumping to get the test unless it’s necessary, but I think they have to listen to their doctors,” the president said.But when pressed again on the issue, Mr. Trump equivocated. In fact, he said, he did plan to get tested “fairly soon,” but not because of his exposure to an infected individual.“Not for that reason,” he said, without providing another reason for the test that until now he appears to have resisted. “I think I will do it anyway. Fairly soon. We’re working out a schedule.”
But hours later, just before midnight, the White House physician released a statement saying Mr. Trump would not be tested — nor would he self-quarantine — even as it became apparent that he had interacted with not one but with at least two infected members of the Brazilian delegation that visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last weekend.Mr. Trump’s interactions with the infected individuals qualified as “LOW risk,” wrote Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, so quarantine was not recommended. He added that because the president continued to show no symptoms of the virus, “testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” Other medical experts have recommended testing for asymptomatic people who could still spread the virus to others. Pressure on Mr. Trump to get tested has been growing since he came into contact with Fabio Wajngarten, a top communications aide to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who tested positive days after a visit last weekend to Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. At Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Wajngarten participated in meetings with the president and posed for a photograph with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Two more Brazilian officials who were pictured at an outdoor table with Mr. Trump said Friday night that they had also tested positive for the virus.Senators Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both announced on Thursday plans to self-quarantine because of potential contact with Mr. Wajngarten, and Mr. Bolsonaro was also tested for the virus. He announced Friday that he had tested negative.But Mr. Trump said he was dubious of Mr. Wajngarten’s condition, and on Friday played down his interactions with him. “There was somebody that they say has it,” he said. “I have no idea who he is. I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds.”In one photograph, which Mr. Wajngarten posted on social media, the Brazilian official is standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Trump, who is clutching a brown “Make Brazil Great Again” baseball cap.ImageThe pictured posted by Fabio Wajngarten.Credit...via Associated PressA video from the event also showed Mr. Wajngarten standing directly behind Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro as they addressed a crowd. Dr. Conley conceded in his letter that Mr. Trump had “spent more time in closer proximity” with one of the other dinner guests who later tested positive.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, declined to say whether any members of the president’s family or his administration would undergo testing. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not respond to questions about whether he would submit himself to a coronavirus test.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not respond to questions about whether he would submit himself to a coronavirus test. Mr. Trump’s news conference took place on a warm, springlike day, with cherry blossoms blooming, a balmy backdrop that belied the anxiety gripping the nation. Governors across the country had ordered schools to close, and people nationwide had been ordered to work from home indefinitely.At the news conference, Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said nursing homes should temporarily restrict all visitors and nonessential personnel from their facilities.But Mr. Trump and the clutch of aides that stood around him seemed like they were beaming in from a less precarious time and place. For all of the recommendations about social distancing and the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to replace handshakes with elbow taps, the president insisted on shaking hands with the chief executives who joined him on the dais.Behind Mr. Trump, the group huddled closely together, not six feet apart, as guidance suggests.When the chief executive of a medical home visit company offered Mr. Trump the recommended elbow bump instead of his hand, the president chuckled. “I like that,” he said, as if it were the first time he was witnessing the gesture.The news conference, which Mr. Trump announced earlier in the day on Twitter, was something of a do-over, after his Oval Office address on Wednesday evening, which was filled with inaccuracies and was generally seen as a failed opportunity to demonstrate leadership or offer guidance during a time of crisis.On Thursday, advisers planned an announcement that new tests for the coronavirus would be available soon, hoping it would put to bed recriminations about the insufficient availability of test kits that has left health officials largely blind to the virus’s domestic spread. But Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Hope Hicks, a top adviser who recently returned to the White House, were still working with the president on the details of his announcement until curtain time.And the tone quickly shifted when Mr. Trump took questions from reporters.“I don’t take responsibility at all,” the president said when pressed about whether he was responsible for delays in testing. He also claimed to have no knowledge of why, in 2018, his administration dismantled a pandemic response team that was once part of the National Security Council.

I don’t know anything about it.”The president’s defensive responses echoed how he began his day, when he blamed President Barack Obama for a severe shortage in test kits — a charge that did little to rebut critics who say that his administration has moved too slowly to ensure a mass national testing ability.“For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.”The president also pointed to the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States that left more than 12,000 people dead, saying that Mr. Obama had mismanaged it.“Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now,” he continued. “The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!”But Mr. Obama’s acting health secretary declared a public health emergency in April 2009, when only 20 known cases of the virus existed and before anyone in the United States had died of it. Mr. Obama declared a national emergency six months later, after hundreds of fatalities.Former Obama officials said that Mr. Trump was making false charges which, even if true, would not account for his failure to act sooner.“This is a typical Trump move to blame the previous administration,” said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a former White House health policy adviser. “We are now more than three years into his administration. He’s had plenty of time to rectify any problems.

"The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s recent primary victories has obscured an important schism within the Democratic Party: between the older voters who carried Mr. Biden to victory and the younger voters who overwhelmingly rejected him.The dividing line is around age 45, and it is as stark as a flipped switch. In some states on Tuesday, Mr. Biden won two-thirds or more of voters older than 45, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won about two-thirds of voters younger than that.Comparatively low turnout among young voters helped save Mr. Biden in the primaries. But in the general election, a similar lack of turnout could become a huge liability — a point Mr. Sanders made explicitly on Wednesday as he announced that he would continue his campaign at least through the next debate on Sunday.“I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,” Mr. Sanders said. “You must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.” The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R.

Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo on Wednesday that winning in November would depend on bringing young voters in. And Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, said at a fund-raiser in Illinois last week that her husband was talking to his staff about “engaging the youth vote and coming up with some youth advocacy.”But Mr. Biden has been campaigning for nearly a year to represent a party that young voters often prefer, and his lack of support among those voters has been evident for a long time.“What I’m a little nervous that we’re in the middle of right now is a repeat of 2016,” said Sarah Audelo, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, who worked on Hillary Clinton’s campaign and said it did not invest enough in outreach to young voters during the primaries. “What that meant was the campaign had to start from scratch in the general, and that is not something Joe Biden can afford to do.”The New York Times spoke with more than 30 young Democrats from 17 states this week, ranging in age from 17 to 34. Most of them said they had voted for Mr. Sanders or planned to do so if he stayed in the race through their state’s primary. Some had voted for Senator Elizabeth Warren before she dropped out. Only two said they wanted Mr. Biden to be the nominee.And while many said they would reluctantly vote for Mr. Biden in November for the sake of beating President Trump, about a third said they would consider staying home or voting for a third-party candidate unless Mr. Biden made significant concessions to the party’s left wing.

They were well aware of his plans to address climate change, student debt and other issues that matter to them — plans that would help Mr. Biden appeal to young voters, his wife said. But those plans, the young Democrats said, were not the solution to the generational gap among the candidates’ supporters; they were a cause.“The plan the Biden campaign put forward for climate change is nowhere near good enough to save our Earth,” said Benjamin Brumer, 28, who lives in California and said he felt hopeless about his future under either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden. “It will be hard, if not impossible, for them to convince me to vote for Biden. But a good first step toward reconciliation would be to make bolder promises for solving climate change.”Lindsay Huber, 29, who lives in Oregon, said that at an “absolute bare minimum,” to win her vote, Mr. Biden needed to stop accepting super PAC money and endorse both “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal.“And it would still be difficult to trust that he’s being truthful, because he has decades of racist, sexist, corporatist, warmongering votes,” Ms. Huber said. “To win us back, the Democratic Party needs to actually listen to us and serve us.

And that is not what many young voters are looking for.“The Republican Party has moved farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, which leaves this huge vacuum, I feel, for younger people who actually want to be a part of a truly progressive movement,” said Hajar Khalid, 20, a student at Columbia University.Ms. Khalid said she supported Medicare for all and would feel somewhat better about voting for Mr. Biden, should he win the nomination, if he had a more comprehensive health care plan or if he chose a truly progressive running mate.“I want to say that despite all of this, I will still vote for the Democratic Party in the general no matter who it is,” she said. “But it’s really hard to say that when the other candidate is Joe Biden, who doesn’t have any real attractive attributes and whose main message seems to be: ‘I won’t change anything to help progressive causes, really, but at least I’m not Trump.’”Beyond the disconnect between young progressives’ ideals and Mr. Biden’s more moderate proposals, there is also a deeper problem: While Mr. Sanders has actively engaged with young people, Mr. Biden has never given much indication that he is seeking their votes at all. At times, he has appeared openly disdainful or condescending toward them.Groups that work with young voters said winning their votes would require speaking more to the policies they want to see enacted, but also considering them in event planning, advertising and communications.

And it could mean enlisting surrogates who have more credibility among young voters than Mr. Biden does. “It’s going to be up to the campaign to craft messages for young people and develop a really good surrogate program,” said Anne Moses, founder and president of Ignite, which encourages young women to enter politics. “I don’t think Biden is the best person to speak directly to young people.”The lack of political attention is a tremendous source of frustration for young people: both those who are considering not voting because they feel they are being ignored, and those who are angry with their peers for not voting because it perpetuates their exclusion.“Biden and other Democrats would be more receptive to young people if they actually voted,” said Ariel Schwartz, 21, a student at SUNY New Paltz. “Would I like a candidate like Bernie Sanders, who puts young people at the forefront? Of course I would. But young voters didn’t turn out in the primaries to support him. That’s our generation’s mistake. We can’t make that same mistake in the general election.”There are many reasons young people are less likely to turn out, ranging from structural obstacles — including voter suppression on college campuses — to disillusionment or distaste for all of the available candidates. But one rationale that came up repeatedly this week was that they did not want to be taken for granted.Democrats assume progressives will vote for them “even as they ignore and dismiss the policy positions most young and progressive voters care about, and yet enough people voted for Jill Stein to lose Hillary the election in multiple key states,” said Sam Anderson, 25, a New Yorker who plans to vote only in down-ballot races unless the party crafts a more progressive platform and Mr. Biden chooses a progressive running mate.“I worry, win or lose, that the party will learn nothing from this election and continue to dismiss the concerns and policy goals of the younger generation they rely upon,” Mr. Anderson said. “The most I can do to influence that at this point is simply not vote and reduce the margin of victory in New York.”Katie Glueck contributed reporting. “It’s going to be up to the campaign to craft messages for young people and develop a really good surrogate program,” said Anne Moses, founder and president of Ignite, which encourages young women to enter politics. “I don’t think Biden is the best person to speak directly to young people.”The lack of political attention is a tremendous source of frustration for young people: both those who are considering not voting because they feel they are being ignored, and those who are angry with their peers for not voting because it perpetuates their exclusion.“Biden and other Democrats would be more receptive to young people if they actually voted,” said Ariel Schwartz, 21, a student at SUNY New Paltz. “Would I like a candidate like Bernie Sanders, who puts young people at the forefront?

"The coronavirus outbreak is inflicting new disruptions on the 2020 presidential campaign by the day, but few compare to Louisiana’s decision on Friday to reschedule its upcoming primary election.It was a highly unusual development in an American political campaign, though not an entirely unprecedented one.So how much disruption can voters expect in the coming months? And how freely can local, state and federal authorities switch up the timing and other details of elections? We took a crack at answering some of the questions that may be on your mind.Why is Louisiana moving its primary election?Louisiana’s secretary of state, R. Kyle Ardoin, a Republican, asked Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, to postpone the state’s April 4 primary by about two months because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. The coronavirus outbreak is inflicting new disruptions on the 2020 presidential campaign by the day, but few compare to Louisiana’s decision on Friday to reschedule its upcoming primary election.It was a highly unusual development in an American political campaign, though not an entirely unprecedented one.So how much disruption can voters expect in the coming months? And how freely can local, state and federal authorities switch up the timing and other details of elections? We took a crack at answering some of the questions that may be on your mind.Why is Louisiana moving its primary election?Louisiana’s secretary of state, R. Kyle Ardoin, a Republican, asked Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, to postpone the state’s April 4 primary by about two months because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. The two men are permitted to do so by a Louisiana law that allows the governor to reschedule an election because of an emergency, so long as the secretary of state has certified that an emergency exists.Have other states changed their primaries in response to the coronavirus?No. Or at least, not yet.The four states with elections coming up on Tuesday — Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois — have taken other precautions to make voting safer without shifting the date of their primaries. It is possible, however, that some later-voting states could follow Louisiana’s example.While a last-minute change like Louisiana’s is highly unusual, states have broad autonomy to define the timing and procedures for primary elections. The exact process for setting primary dates varies from state to state. That is why a number of states changed the dates of their primaries and caucuses between 2016 and 2020, and why Republicans in several states were able to cancel their 2020 primary elections to minimize intraparty competition for President Trump.

But the Democratic Party also has its own rules requiring that all primary elections be completed by June 9, and that all delegates to its national convention in Milwaukee be selected by June 20. Any states that defy that timetable — including Louisiana — could be penalized by the national party with a reduction in their delegate count.Could the general election be postponed or canceled?Only with enormous difficulty.The date of the general election is set by federal law and has been fixed since 1845. It would take a change in federal law to move that date. That would mean legislation enacted by Congress, signed by the president and subject to challenge in the courts. To call that unlikely would be an understatement.And even if all of that happened, there would not be much flexibility in choosing an alternate election date: The Constitution mandates that the new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s term must begin on Jan. 20. Those dates cannot be changed just by the passage of normal legislation.After Louisiana’s announcement on Friday, Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer, knocked down what he described as a wave of queries about whether the November election could be similarly revised.“I am getting a lot of questions about the November election,” Mr. Elias wrote on Twitter. “While states can set their own primary days, the federal general election is set by federal statute as the the [sic] Tuesday following the first Monday in November. This date cannot be changed by a state nor by the President.” To call that unlikely would be an understatement.And even if all of that happened, there would not be much flexibility in choosing an alternate election date: The Constitution mandates that the new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s term must begin on Jan. 20.

This date cannot be changed by a state nor by the President.” Can the president cancel or postpone an election with an executive order?No. The president has a lot of power, but when it comes to elections he is far more constrained than the governor of Louisiana.What about the procedures for voting in the November election?While the date of the presidential election is set by federal law, the procedures for voting are generally controlled at the state level.That’s why we have such a complicated patchwork of voting regulations, with some states allowing early and absentee voting; some permitting voting by mail or same-day voter registration; others requiring certain kinds of identification for voters; and many states doing few or none of those things.

So it is possible that states could revise their voting procedures in response to a public health crisis, perhaps by making it easier to vote by mail or through various absentee procedures that would not require people to cluster together on one particular date.Washington State, a focal point for the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, has conducted elections by mail for years, and its presidential primary on March 10 was able to unfold without disruption.The federal government could also take steps to mandate or encourage different voting procedures, without changing the timing of the election. Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, has proposed that Congress require states to offer “no excuse absentee balloting” for the general election, so that anyone can opt to vote by a method besides in-person voting on Election Day.

Have American elections been moved because of emergencies in the past?Yes, at the state and local level.Perhaps most notably, the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks came on the morning of a municipal primary election in New York City, and the state Legislature passed emergency legislation postponing the election by two weeks. In 2017, some municipal elections in Florida were briefly delayed because of Hurricane Irma.It was reported in 2004 that some Bush administration officials had discussed putting in place a method of postponing a federal election in the event of a terrorist attack. But that idea fizzled quickly, and Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, said that the United States had held “elections in this country when we were at war, even when we were in civil war. And we should have the elections on time.” Have American elections been moved because of emergencies in the past?Yes, at the state and local level.Perhaps most notably, the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks came on the morning of a municipal primary election in New York City, and the state Legislature passed emergency legislation postponing the election by two weeks.

"President Trump made overhauling the federal judiciary one of his top priorities, moving with particular speed to infuse the highly influential appeals courts with reliably conservative judges.Working with his Republican allies in the Senate, he installed 51 judges in just three years — appointing more than a quarter of the appellate bench at a record pace.The New York Times conducted a deep examination of the new judges to obtain a collective portrait of the group. It included interviews with people close to the nomination process, a review of biographical information submitted to the Senate by Mr. Trump’s appointees and those of his last two predecessors, former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and an analysis of published decisions and dissents by the judges.The article on the findings can be found here. These are some of the takeaways about the new judges.They have deeply conservative credentials, and they aren’t shy about themMuch like Mr. Trump himself, many of the new judges break longstanding conventions and have backgrounds that differ significantly from those named by Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.

They were more openly engaged in conservative causes important to Republicans, such as opposition to gay marriage and to government funding for abortion. They often have political experience on their résumés, including posts in the federal government. They also more typically donated money to political candidates and causes.All but eight had ties to the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that has been central to the White House’s appointment process and ascendant in Republican circles in recent years for its advocacy of strictly interpreting the Constitution.They are more likely to be young, white and male, and they have elite schoolingThese are lifetime appointments, and Mr. Trump has put a premium on appointing young judges.Thirty-three percent were under 45 when appointed, compared with just five percent under Mr. Obama and 19 percent under Mr. Bush. The median age was five-and-a-half years younger than it was under Mr. Obama, and three-and-a-half years younger than under Mr. Bush.Mr. Trump has also reversed a trend of increasing diversity on the appellate bench under Mr. Obama. Two-thirds of Mr. Trump’s appointees are white men.Many of the appointees have elite credentials, with nearly half having trained as lawyers at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago or Yale, and more than a third having clerked for a Supreme Court justice.

They made it to the bench because Republicans in the Senate sidelined DemocratsIn less partisan times, many of the new judges, with their polarizing paper trails and histories of fighting for Republican causes, would have lacked a clear path to confirmation because of Senate customs meant to ensure bipartisan consensus over judicial nominees.But some of those customs have been tossed aside, allowing Republicans, who control the Senate, to get their way even when Democrats object.Two-thirds of the new appellate judges failed to win the support of 60 senators, historically a requirement of consensus that was first jettisoned by the Democratic-controlled Senate midway through the Obama administration.When Republicans gained the majority, they followed suit and took the custom-breaking even further. They did away with a courtesy that allowed senators to sign off on nominees for courts in their home states.

This was their path to confirmation.By The New York Times",2020-03-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/appellate-judges-trump-appointees.html,new_york_times
"As a Republican candidate for the Texas Supreme Court, Don R. Willett flaunted his uncompromising conservatism, boasting of endorsements from groups with “pro-life, pro-faith, pro-family” credentials.“I intend to build such a fiercely conservative record on the court that I will be unconfirmable for any future federal judicial post — and proudly so,” a Republican rival quoted him telling party leaders.Judge Willett served a dozen years on the Texas bench. But rather than disqualifying him, his record there propelled him to the very job he had deemed beyond reach. President Trump nominated him to a federal appeals court, and Republicans in the Senate narrowly confirmed him on a party-line vote.As Mr. Trump seeks re-election, his rightward overhaul of the federal judiciary — in particular, the highly influential appeals courts — has been invoked as one of his most enduring accomplishments. While individual nominees have drawn scrutiny, The New York Times conducted a deep examination of all 51 new appellate judges to obtain a collective portrait of the Trump-populated bench.

While individual nominees have drawn scrutiny, The New York Times conducted a deep examination of all 51 new appellate judges to obtain a collective portrait of the Trump-populated bench. The review shows that the Trump class of appellate judges, much like the president himself, breaks significantly with the norms set by his Democratic and Republican predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.The lifetime appointees — who make up more than a quarter of the entire appellate bench — were more openly engaged in causes important to Republicans, such as opposition to gay marriage and to government funding for abortion.They more typically held a political post in the federal government and donated money to political candidates and causes. Just four had no discernible political activity in their past, and several were confirmed in spite of an unfavorable rating from the American Bar Association — the first time that had happened at the appellate level in decades.Two-thirds are white men, and as a group, they are much younger than the Obama and Bush appointees.Once on the bench, the Trump appointees have stood out from their fellow judges, according to an analysis by The Times of more than 10,000 published decisions and dissents through December.When ruling on cases, they have been notably more likely than other Republican appointees to disagree with peers selected by Democratic presidents, and more likely to agree with those Republican appointees, suggesting they are more consistently conservative. Among the dozen or so judges that most fit the pattern, The Times found, are three Mr. Trump has signaled were on his Supreme Court shortlist.

While the appellate courts favor consensus and disagreement remains relatively rare — there were 125 instances when a Trump appointee wrote the majority opinion or dissent in a split decision — the new judges have ruled on disputed cases across a range of contentious issues, including abortion, immigration, L.G.B.T. rights and lobbying requirements, the examination shows.

One new judge, who had held a political job in the Trump administration, dissented on an issue of particular importance to the president: disclosure of his financial records. The judge, Neomi Rao, opposed a decision requiring the release of the documents to a congressional committee, a mandate the president continues to resist and is now before the Supreme Court.“They have long records of standing up, and they’re not afraid of being unpopular,” said Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group that has pushed for the mold-breaking appointments. Ms. Severino once served as a law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the Supreme Court’s most reliably conservative members.Stephen B. Burbank, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump’s appointments reflected attempts by recent presidents to draw the federal judiciary — a constitutionally independent branch of government — into policy debates more appropriate in Congress and the White House.“The problem as I see it is not that judges differ ideologically — of course they do — nor is it that a Republican president would look for someone with congenial ideological preferences,” Mr. Burbank said. “It’s that in recent decades the search has been for hard-wired ideologues because they’re reliable policy agents.”Mr. Trump has appointed more judges to the appeals courts, where eight of the nine current Supreme Court Justices served, than any other president during the first three years in office. Also known as circuits, the 13 courts are the last stop for federal cases before the Supreme Court, and nearly all federal litigation ends there.

The Times examination was based on interviews with dozens of people close to the nomination process, including some of Mr. Trump’s appointees; the analysis of thousands of published decisions and dissents since Mr. Trump became president; a review of detailed biographical and financial questionnaires submitted by all 168 appellate judges named by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, as well as their records, public statements and campaign contributions since 1989.Judicial appointments, a standard measure of a president’s legacy, almost always draw partisan scrutiny, as Republicans tend to appoint conservative lawyers who interpret the Constitution according to what they say was its original meaning, and Democrats lean toward liberal appointees with a more expansive view. But Mr. Trump’s record is particularly striking because of the divisive atmosphere, the examination shows, and the president’s disruptive approach to governing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and none of the judges contacted by The Times would agree to be quoted.

But Mr. Trump’s record is particularly striking because of the divisive atmosphere, the examination shows, and the president’s disruptive approach to governing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and none of the judges contacted by The Times would agree to be quoted. When Mr. Trump took office there were 103 unfilled federal court openings, in addition to a Supreme Court seat, in part because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader of the Senate, and allies had refused to proceed with confirming many of Mr. Obama’s nominees. The last time so many vacancies had been left to a successor of the opposing party was when the federal bench was expanded by dozens of judges under President George H.W. Bush.Mr. Trump wasted no time in seizing the opportunity. During his first three years in office, with Mr. McConnell’s assistance, he was able to name nearly as many appellate judges as Mr. Obama had appointed over two terms.And he did so with great political flourish. More than one-third of the Trump appointees have filled seats previously occupied by judges appointed by Democrats, tipping the balance toward conservatives in some circuits that include largely Democratic states like New York and Connecticut. Even in the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit, a reliably liberal appeals court, Mr. Trump has significantly narrowed the gap between judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents.With Republicans and Democrats in Congress retreating to their corners, many of the Trump appointees have benefited from Republicans’ decision to extend a contentious and partisan confirmation path that upended bipartisan Senate practices.

Two-thirds of the new appellate judges failed to win the support of 60 senators, historically a requirement of consensus that was first jettisoned by the Democratic-controlled Senate midway through the Obama administration because Republicans were blocking nominees to the D.C. Circuit. After he became majority leader, Mr. McConnell followed suit when Democrats initially blocked Mr. Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.About a third did not receive the signoff of both home-state senators, a courtesy for a nomination to move forward that was tossed aside in late 2017 by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, then the Judiciary Committee’s Republican chairman. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley’s successor in that role, carried the decision forward. Crucially, that meant Mr. Trump did not have to compromise on his appellate picks in states with a Democratic senator.Just two found unanimous support across the aisle, a sharp drop from both the Obama and Bush nominees.According to a tally by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, Mr. Trump’s appointees across the judiciary have drawn three times more “no” votes in the Senate than all confirmed judges in the 20th century combined. So far, Mr. Trump has appointed more than 185 federal judges.On the appellate bench, Mr. Trump’s appointees have drawn nearly twice as many “no” votes as did those of Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, The Times’s analysis shows.

In a history-making intervention, one of Mr. Trump’s appellate picks was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 deadlock. It was Mr. Pence’s 12th tiebreaking vote in the Senate, the most of anyone in his office since the 1870s, and the only time a vice president installed a nominee to the bench.

Kobes, had been working on Capitol Hill as an aide to a Republican senator. He was rated unqualified by the American Bar Association, which questioned his ability to reflect “complex legal analysis” and “knowledge of the law” in his writing.He got the job anyway, with Mr. Grassley proclaiming on Twitter in December 2018 that the confirmation had “made HISTORY.” Judge Kobes became Mr. Trump’s 30th confirmed appointee to the appellate bench.Democrats, powerless to block the nominees, have been sidelined as angry bystanders.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called Mr. Trump’s appellate appointees “far outside the judicial mainstream,” adding that she believed Republicans were using them to advance “a particular agenda.” She voted against all but 14 of the appellate nominees.”Americans are certainly aware of Supreme Court nominations,” Ms. Feinstein said in a statement to The Times, “but most don’t pay close attention to the lower courts, which can have an even more direct effect on their lives.”From Fringe to MainstreamMr. Trump has staked his presidency on upending conventions, and his approach to the judiciary breaks sharply with that of past presidents.He unapologetically views judges as agents of the presidents who appointed them — calling out an “Obama judge,” for instance, for ruling against the Trump administration in an immigration case. He frequently attributes his popularity among Republicans to his judicial appointments. And he has not been shy about politicizing the process.“95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party,” he wrote on Twitter in January. “Thank you! 191 Federal Judges (a record), and two Supreme Court Justices, approved. Best Economy & Employment Numbers EVER. Thank you to our great New, Smart and Nimble REPUBLICAN PARTY. Join now, it’s where people want to be!” The judge, Jonathan A.

Roberts Jr. recently described an independent judiciary as “a key source of national unity and stability” — the examination by The Times shows that the Trump administration has filled the appellate courts with formidable allies who fought for a range of issues important to Republicans.Democratic presidents have also sought out reliable political allies when filling some judicial posts, but Mr. Trump’s approach has left little to chance.His appointees include former litigators who argued against legalizing same-sex marriage; advocated blocking Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers performing abortions; argued that corporations with religious owners could not be required to pay for insurance coverage of certain forms of birth control; and supported the Trump administration’s choice to include a question about citizenship on the census.In the past, many conservatives have been left disappointed when judges appointed by Republican presidents were seen to have lost their resolve on the bench. Now what matters most with Mr. Trump’s appointees, said Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, is that they come with rock-solid conservative résumés.“You have to demand a paper trail — no more skeleton nominees,” said Mr. Blackman, who advised the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican, and is a strong supporter of the Trump approach.

One standout appointee, Kyle Duncan, now an appellate judge in New Orleans, fought to uphold Louisiana’s gay-marriage ban before the Supreme Court, defended a North Carolina law restricting transgender people from using their preferred bathrooms and represented Hobby Lobby when it sued the federal government over the requirement that it provide employees with insurance coverage for some birth control.

He had worked as general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group that has been a strong defender of the religious right.Responding to questions from senators about the North Carolina law, he said he had been “advancing not my own personal beliefs but legal arguments on behalf of my client’s interests, just as I have done in every case to the best of my ability.”Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the federal appeals court in Philadelphia, last September emphasized the independence of judges once they took the bench, saying, “We certainly are not viewing ourselves as members of teams or camps or parties.”Many of the appointees have elite credentials, with nearly half having trained as lawyers at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago or Yale, and more than a third having clerked for a Supreme Court justice, surpassing the appointees of both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.But Mr. Trump’s appellate picks often have less judicial experience, The Times found. About 40 percent previously served as a judge, compared with more than half of the Bush and Obama appointees.Mr. Trump named some of his judges before they received a rating from the American Bar Association, which Republicans have long viewed as biased against their nominees. Three deemed unqualified were confirmed — a step not taken at the appellate level since at least 1975, when a former governor of Connecticut nominated by former Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford joined the bench, according to Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist focusing on the judiciary.

Mr. Trump is betting that the judges will back Republican priorities for a long time: The median age of the appointees is five-and-a-half years younger than it was under Mr. Obama, and three-and-a-half years younger than under Mr. Bush. Thirty-three percent were under 45 when appointed, compared with just five percent under Mr. Obama and 19 percent under Mr. Bush. And countering a trend of increasing diversity on the appellate bench under Mr. Obama, two-thirds of Mr. Trump’s appointees are white men.

They are also well off: Their median net worth is nearly $2 million — adjusted for inflation, that is on a par with the worth of Obama appointees, and about a half-million dollars more than that of Bush appointees.Perhaps most telling, all but eight of the new judges have had ties to the Federalist Society, a legal group that has been central to the White House’s appointment process and ascendant in Republican circles in recent years for its advocacy of strictly interpreting the Constitution.Nearly twice as many appointees have had ties to the group as did those of Mr. Trump’s most recent Republican predecessor, Mr. Bush. Early this year, a proposal was circulated among federal judges by the court system’s ethical advisory arm that would ban membership in the group.

He also had more than 25,000 posts on Twitter that often focused on current affairs and Republican politics, even some jabbing Mr. Trump as a candidate.During the last Republican administration, under Mr. Bush, he had advised judicial nominees “to bob and weave, be the teeniest tiniest target you can be,” Judge Willett said during a speech in 2010, adding, “You want to be as bland, forgettable and unremarkable as possible.”No more. The Trump approach has translated into a new breed of appellate appointees with open experience in ideological and political warfare.John Malcolm, a conservative legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, said he was looking for “people who have the strength of their convictions.” He drew up a list in 2016 of recommended Supreme Court nominees that was embraced by Mr. Trump.About three-quarters of Mr. Trump’s appellate appointees donated to political candidates and causes, a significantly higher proportion than Mr. Obama’s and slightly ahead of Mr. Bush’s, according to an analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in Politics and the Center for Responsive Politics. “We have seen our views go from the fringe, views that in years past would inhibit someone’s chances to be considered for the federal bench,” he said, “to being the center of the conversation.”Battle-Tested ConservativesJudge Willett, the former Texas Supreme Court justice, had a paper trail replete with political connections and ties to prominent Texas Republicans when he was nominated to the federal bench in 2017.He had raised over $4 million for two campaigns for the state bench, more than half of it from lawyers, lobbyists and oil interests, according to the National Institute on Money in Politics.

Judge Rao had run a regulatory office in the White House. Judges Steven J. Menashi and Gregory G. Katsas had worked in the office of the White House counsel. Judge Patrick J.

At least eight actively fought against legalizing gay marriage, and at least as many argued for immigration positions now embraced by the Trump administration. At least 18 sought to limit access to abortion or contraception.Some nominees amassed their conservative credentials by filing friend-of-the-court briefs, weighing in on cases especially important to Republicans.Judge VanDyke, appointed to the Ninth Circuit in Nevada, had been prolific. As solicitor general of Montana, according to published emails, he encouraged the state’s attorney general to support a 20-week abortion ban in Arizona, to defend a professional photographer’s refusal to shoot a same-sex commitment ceremony in New Mexico and to challenge a ban on semiautomatic weapons in New York.The fact that Montana was not directly affected by the cases did not matter. In an email to the solicitor general in Alabama — who would also be named to the appellate bench by Mr. Trump — he wrote about the New York ban: “Semiautomatic firearms are fun to hunt elk with, as the attached picture attests :).” The Great Falls Tribune, which obtained the emails, published a photo of the now-judge in hunting garb.Judge Michael H. Park, another appointee, had come to the support of the Trump administration in its unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the census. As a private lawyer representing the Project on Fair Representation, a conservative group, he argued in 2018 that the question was justified, calling it “immensely helpful to redistricting and voting rights litigation.”The Supreme Court disagreed.

Once on the bench, they quickly confirmed that they could shake things up. Three on that short list — Judges Joan Larsen, David R. Stras and Amul Thapar — were among those identified by The Times as having a penchant for disagreeing with Democratic nominees. They voted differently from those judges 23 percent of the time, but from judges appointed by Republican presidents only four percent of the time.Judge Larsen and Judge Stras had been state supreme court justices named by Republican governors in their home states. Judge Thapar was elevated by Mr. Trump from a federal district court in Kentucky, where he had been appointed by Mr. Bush.Unlike lower courts, the appellate courts, which review other courts’ decisions, do not have juries. Instead, cases are largely decided by panels of three judges, usually selected randomly from all of the judges in the circuit.There is a culture of consensus in most circuits, and in the cases reviewed by The Times, appellate judges of both parties agreed with one another the vast majority of times. But when they did not, the Trump appointees stood out.On panels that had members appointed by presidents of the same party, dissent occurred just 7 percent of the time. The rate jumped to 12 percent on panels that included a mix of judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.But when a Trump appointee wrote an opinion for a panel with a lone Democrat, or served as the only Republican appointee, the dissent rate rose to 17 percent — meaning the likelihood of dissent was nearly 1.5 times higher if a Trump appointee was involved.

Writing a dissent marks a bold break from fellow members of the bench, experts say, and by definition sets the judge apart. The dissenting opinions can also inform future legal arguments and cases.“You’re going to get some judges who will bite their tongue and say, ‘These are my colleagues — I’m not going to rock the boat unless I feel strongly about it,’” said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education arm of the federal court system.In other instances, however, judges “go in slashing and burning” with no regard for comity — or with an eye to drawing attention to themselves, he said. “Some of them obviously are going to be thinking about the next vacancy on the Supreme Court,” Mr. Wheeler said.In a speech in 2017, Mr. McGahn, the former White House counsel and a main driver of the Trump selection process, said “judicial courage” was as important as judicial independence.The Times analysis included 10,025 opinions of three-judge panels from 2017 through 2019 that were tagged as “published, written and signed” in the federal center’s integrated case database.It covered more than 1,975 cases involving at least one Trump appointee. Because many of Mr. Trump’s earliest appointments occurred in appellate courts dominated by judges named by Republicans, more than half of those cases did not involve panels with judges appointed by a Democrat.Of the 125 cases in which a Trump appointee wrote a dissent or an opinion eliciting dissent, about half involved civil rights or criminal matters. The others touched on a wide variety of topics, from transgender rights to pregnancy discrimination to the limits of police powers. Writing a dissent marks a bold break from fellow members of the bench, experts say, and by definition sets the judge apart. The dissenting opinions can also inform future legal arguments and cases.“You’re going to get some judges who will bite their tongue and say, ‘These are my colleagues — I’m not going to rock the boat unless I feel strongly about it,’” said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education arm of the federal court system.In other instances, however, judges “go in slashing and burning” with no regard for comity — or with an eye to drawing attention to themselves, he said. “Some of them obviously are going to be thinking about the next vacancy on the Supreme Court,” Mr. Wheeler said.In a speech in 2017, Mr. McGahn, the former White House counsel and a main driver of the Trump selection process, said “judicial courage” was as important as judicial independence.The Times analysis included 10,025 opinions of three-judge panels from 2017 through 2019 that were tagged as “published, written and signed” in the federal center’s integrated case database.It covered more than 1,975 cases involving at least one Trump appointee. Because many of Mr. Trump’s earliest appointments occurred in appellate courts dominated by judges named by Republicans, more than half of those cases did not involve panels with judges appointed by a Democrat.Of the 125 cases in which a Trump appointee wrote a dissent or an opinion eliciting dissent, about half involved civil rights or criminal matters. The others touched on a wide variety of topics, from transgender rights to pregnancy discrimination to the limits of police powers. In one instance, a Trump appointee joined with a Bush appointee to strike down a key part of the Affordable Care Act. A Democratic-nominated judge dissented.Amy Coney Barrett, another judge on Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court shortlist, was among the new appointees who wrote a dissent cited by conservatives.Judge Barrett, a noted originalist, once served as a clerk to former Justice Antonin Scalia. But she stood out among the Trump appointees not by disagreeing with Democratic appointees but by taking on two judges named by former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.The subject was Second Amendment gun rights, and Ms. Barrett took a broader view than her colleagues.The owner of a therapeutic shoe-insert company had pleaded guilty to mail fraud and, as a felon, was barred from owning a gun. He objected, claiming the penalty was unconstitutional.The two Reagan appointees upheld a lower-court ruling against the man. Their decision was based in part on the notion that governments banned felons from owning firearms because they were considered more likely to abuse them.

Their decision was based in part on the notion that governments banned felons from owning firearms because they were considered more likely to abuse them. But in dissenting, Judge Barrett argued that lawmakers could prohibit only violent people from owning firearms, and that the government had not proved that a nonviolent felon would turn violent.“History does not support the proposition that felons lose their Second Amendment rights solely because of their status as felons,” she wrote.A dissent by another new appointee, Judge Rao, the former Trump administration official, staked out territory important to the president and his allies.Two appellate judges, both appointed by Democrats, ruled that Mr. Trump’s accountants had to comply with a congressional subpoena for eight years of his financial records.Judge Rao, who holds the appellate seat vacated by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, questioned whether Democrats in the House of Representatives had overshot their authority. At a hearing on the case, she suggested the Democrats were, in effect, seeking the “regulation of the president.”In her 67-page dissent, she wrote that the subpoena went beyond Congress’s authority, and that the documents in question could be obtained only in an impeachment inquiry.She also chided her fellow judges for allowing Congress to conduct “a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government,” suggesting they had chosen to fixate on worst-case scenarios.

The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court, where two Trump appointees, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch, will help determine its fate.Tipping the BalanceThe push in the Senate last November to confirm a White House lawyer for a top federal judgeship in New York unnerved Democrats.The lawyer, Steven Menashi had a trail of inflammatory writings about feminism and multiculturalism. He had declined to answer specific questions about his role in the Trump administration on family detentions and education policy.And he had managed to get a confirmation vote only because Republicans did away with a courtesy rule letting home-state senators — in this case, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer — block nominees they found unworthy. Mr. Schumer had described him as “a textbook example of someone who does not deserve to sit on the federal bench.”Not only did he get his seat on the Second Circuit, but his appointment marked a signature moment in Mr. Trump’s bid to tilt the nation’s appellate courts to the right: Judge Menashi’s confirmation flipped the balance toward Republican appointees in a circuit encompassing three states — New York, Connecticut and Vermont — dominated at nearly every level by Democrats.Judges named by Mr. Trump have forged new majorities in two other circuits — the Third and the 11th. And they have come close in the nation’s largest appeals court, the Ninth, based in San Francisco, which has long issued rulings favorable to liberal causes.The unequal split between Democratic and Republican appointees can give the circuits distinct reputations as liberal or conservative.

Mr. Trump has called the Ninth Circuit “out of control” and a “complete & total disaster,” and he has suggested that some of its decisions related to immigration and the border have threatened national security.In one case, the court ruled that the Trump administration could not erase Obama-era protections for so-called Dreamers, children brought into the United States illegally.In another, it blocked the administration’s effort to speed up the deportation of asylum seekers. It also rejected Mr. Trump’s policy restricting travel from eight countries, six of them largely Muslim.“Every case that gets filed in the Ninth Circuit, we get beaten,” Mr. Trump complained in 2018. “It’s a disgrace.”At the close of the Obama administration, 18 judges on the circuit had been appointed by Democratic presidents, seven had been named by Republicans and four seats were vacant. Through his appointments, Mr. Trump has whittled the majority held by Democratic appointees to just three making it less likely that a liberal philosophy can dominate so thoroughly.Allies of the president have celebrated. In emails to supporters, the National Organization for Marriage, a group established to fight the legalization of same-sex marriage, lauded the change “from the most liberal court in the country to one that is much more balanced.”Brian S. Brown, president of the group, heralded that Mr. Trump was remaking the court and others across the country. “Judges will be with us for a lot longer than any politician who holds office,” he wrote.

Conservatives have also celebrated Trump appointees in circuits where the balance of power has not shifted. Their votes have proved significant in so-called en-banc hearings — when a decision by a panel of appellate judges is reviewed by a larger group of judges.In 2014, a Louisiana law required doctors performing abortions to be able to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. Opponents of the law predicted a chilling effect on access to abortions. Those in favor argued that it protected women seeking abortions by making sure doctors were competent.

Opponents of the law predicted a chilling effect on access to abortions. Those in favor argued that it protected women seeking abortions by making sure doctors were competent. The case, now being decided by the Supreme Court, has been playing out in federal courts for years. A district court judge struck down the law, but was reversed by a divided three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit. When opponents of the law asked all judges of the circuit to hear an appeal, the request was denied, 9-6, with four judges appointed by Mr. Trump joining the majority.At an en-banc hearing in Missouri, four Trump-appointed judges in the Eighth Circuit joined a 6-5 decision that loosened disclosure requirements for political activists.In the case, a man who ran a nonprofit advocating conservative causes had sued Missouri officials over a lobbying registration law he deemed unconstitutional. He was not a lobbyist, he argued, addressing lawmakers often but not spending or receiving money for it. A lower court and a three-judge appeals panel had sided with the state, requiring him to register out of transparency.Among the four Trump appointees who overturned that ruling were Judge Kobes, the former Senate aide who had been confirmed when Mr. Pence offered up a tiebreaking vote; Judge Stras, who was on Mr. Trump’s shortlist for the Supreme Court; and Judge Grasz of Nebraska.

As he seeks re-election, Mr. Trump has showcased his role in fulfilling the Republican judicial agenda. One afternoon last November, he gathered an array of Republican leaders and conservative judicial activists to celebrate his success.“I’ve always heard, actually, that when you become president, the most — single most — important thing you can do is federal judges,” he said.How the Numbers Were CalculatedIn examining the president’s judicial appointments, The Times compiled two databases of information about judges who were named to the U.S. Court of Appeals by Mr. Trump and his predecessors.One focused on the professional and political backgrounds of judges appointed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush. The other analyzed published opinions in the court’s 12 regional circuits to gain insights into ruling patterns and rates of dissent.The BiographiesThe Times compared the appellate judges’ experiences outside the court. All told, there were 168 appointees — 51 by Mr. Trump, 55 by Mr. Obama and 62 by Mr. Bush.The database drew primarily on biographical questionnaires the appointees had submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, obtained from staff members, the Congressional Record and other sources. They listed jobs and internships held since college, judicial clerkships, club memberships, affiliations with political campaigns and other information. Some judges volunteered more detail than others.Separately, campaign finance data was compiled from two sources: the National Institute on Money in Politics, which has access to state donations since 2000 and federal ones since 2010, and the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations beginning in 1989. In searching the donations, The Times sometimes found matches by using variations of judges’ names, including maiden names, as well as other relevant information like employment.Calculations of partisan donations were based on federal contributions to political candidates or causes of the same party as the judge’s appointing president. Past political activity was measured more broadly and included work for politicians of any party; volunteer or paid work for political campaigns of any party; memberships affiliated with any party; donations to campaigns of any party; participation as a candidate for any party; references to “Republican” or “Democrat” in any answer in the questionnaire; and work in a political post in the federal government, including political duties assigned to a federal employee.The age of judges on their appointment date was based on years of birth provided by the Federal Judicial Center, the official clearinghouse for court research.The Rulings and DissentsThe database includes more than 10,000 opinions published from 2017 through last year in the 12 regional circuit courts. The 13th appeals court, the Federal Circuit, hears mostly intellectual property cases and has no Trump appointees.The case list was published by the Federal Judicial Center. Only cases designated “published, written and signed” were included in the analysis, because they carry the weight of precedence and represent the most legally impactful work. For consistency, all of the cases involved a standard three-judge panel with a named opinion author.For every case, The Times parsed the text of the opinion to identify the judges, whose names are redacted from the judicial center’s data. Additional information about the judges was obtained by joining the case data to a separate biography data set kept by the center.The data was analyzed in two ways: first, to determine how often cases involved a dissent, and second, to determine how often individual judges agreed or disagreed with their two colleagues on a panel.On the case level, the data showed that when a judge named by Mr. Trump served in a pivotal role — as the author of an opinion on a panel with only one Democratic appointee, or as the only Republican appointee on a panel — the rate of dissent increased significantly.For individual judges, the analysis split each panel into three pairings. If the case was unanimously decided, all judges were deemed to have agreed. If one judge dissented, that judge was deemed to have disagreed with the other two. While judges appointed by presidents of different parties were more likely to disagree than judges appointed by presidents of the same party, the difference was far more pronounced for many, though not all, of the new Trump appointees, the analysis found.There were caveats to the findings. Some of the circuits have a higher dissent rate overall, for example, and some circuits appear more often in the database because they conduct a higher share of their work in the form of published opinions.Even accounting for those factors, the findings were supported by a separate regression analysis, which accounted for other variables, including the circuit hearing the case, the topic before the court, the type of appeal and whether the ruling affirmed or overturned a decision by a lower court.Hillary Flynn and Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.

Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont canceled primary-night campaign events on Tuesday.The Democratic National Committee moved Sunday’s debate to Washington and announced that it would go on without an audience or the news media (more on that later).Mr. Biden swapped out in-person campaigning for “virtual events” (not entirely without issues), and Mr. Sanders, too, curtailed travel and canceled big gatherings.

Congressional Democrats, Republicans and President Trump tried to agree on a relief package in between attacks on one another.Mr. Trump addressed the nation about the crisis. Then, seeking to contrast themselves with him, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders did the same.As our colleagues Lisa Lerer and Reid J. Epstein write, the 2020 campaign has been chugging along a certain way for the past year. And now, because of the coronavirus, “almost overnight, everything has changed.”
In his speech, Mr. Biden used the language and tone of crisis in proposing a detailed coronavirus plan and setting goals for testing, hospital capacity and a vaccine. Mr. Sanders warned that the American death toll could exceed the number of American soldiers killed during World War II. Both sharply criticized Mr. Trump. “This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,” Mr. Biden said. “Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by adversarial relationships with the truth that he continues to have.”Our newsroom is working around the clock to provide live updates about the coronavirus. We are providing free access to our global coverage of the virus to ensure you can get the news you need.

Meanwhile, Louisiana announced on Friday that it would postpone its April 4 primary until June 20.Another super (small ‘s’) Tuesday for Biden A week after dominating on Super Tuesday, Mr. Biden “took command of the Democratic presidential race in decisive fashion,” as our colleagues wrote, winning at least four more contests this past Tuesday on the strength of a multiracial coalition that proved especially powerful in the South and the Midwest.Mr. Biden’s victory in Michigan — the biggest prize of the night — was particularly damaging to Mr. Sanders, who won the state in the 2016 primary. Mr. Biden is also ahead in Washington State with nearly all of the vote counted. That’s another place where Mr. Sanders won four years ago and had hoped to do well again.So far, Mr. Sanders has won only one of the six states that voted Tuesday: North Dakota, which awarded just 14 delegates.Before Tuesday, several high-profile figures offered their endorsements. Mr. Sanders got the backing of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Biden received endorsements from Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom dropped out of the presidential race before the first nominating votes.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s contests, five takeaways and an analysis of the delegate math moving forward.In a news analysis, our colleagues Matt Flegenheimer and Katie Glueck write: “So thorough is Mr. Biden’s hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.”Sanders stays in (for now) A week after dominating on Super Tuesday, Mr. Biden “took command of the Democratic presidential race in decisive fashion,” as our colleagues wrote, winning at least four more contests this past Tuesday on the strength of a multiracial coalition that proved especially powerful in the South and the Midwest.Mr. Biden’s victory in Michigan — the biggest prize of the night — was particularly damaging to Mr. Sanders, who won the state in the 2016 primary.

Instead, he elected to wait, assess and ultimately speak to reporters the next day.He declared that he would stay in the primary race and participate in Sunday’s debate with Mr. Biden. But he also made what our colleagues called “a defiant case for his liberal policy agenda,” asserting that “a strong majority” of Democrats supported his progressive ideas.He did not, however, attack Mr. Biden or vow to carry his fight to a bitter end.Our colleagues Alexander Burns and Matt Flegenheimer called it “a concession speech, of a kind.”We also wrote about why Mr. Sanders is staying in the race for now and who he has blamed for his decline, and talked to voters who see him as their only hope.And in case you were wondering, Senator Elizabeth Warren is unlikely to endorse Mr. Sanders, according to several people close to her.Changes to the Biden campaignAs our colleagues Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan have noted, Mr. Biden’s campaign organization has for months been flimsy, underfunded and filled with operational challenges. Thankfully for him, it did not end up hurting him on Super Tuesday or this past week. Mr. Sanders did not give a speech Tuesday night as race after race was called for Mr. Biden.

And as another precaution, the event will take place without a live audience or assembled press corps.For the first time in this campaign, only two candidates will be onstage: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. And as our colleague Shane Goldmacher writes, this debate will be different from most others in modern politics: “Both men will be auditioning for the presidency amid an unfolding national emergency.”Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is still running, too, but she has not qualified for a debate in months.

"For the first time in the long Democratic primary campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet in a one-on-one debate, facing off Sunday night as Mr. Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy against a rival who has taken a commanding position in the race. But that isn’t why this debate is different from most others in modern politics.Both men will be auditioning for the presidency amid an unfolding national emergency over the coronavirus; the last candidates to debate in such urgent circumstances were Barack Obama and John McCain during the 2008 financial crisis.

There will be no live audience and no spin room. One moderator who had potentially been exposed to the virus has bowed out to avoid  spreading it. Debates are often unpredictable, but it is especially hard to game out how this debate featuring a moderate standard-bearer and a liberal challenger will unfold and how people will process it. Hundreds of thousands of viewers, if not millions, will have been personally affected by Sunday, as public gathering spaces are shuttered, schools are closed and on Thursday the stock market plunged by the largest percentage in decades (it snapped back upward on Friday).“It is going to be a different kind of debate,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, an early ally and surrogate for Mr. Biden, said with more than a little understatement.The extraordinary situation offers an unusual challenge and opportunity. It will provide a national platform and audience for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders to preview their own brands of presidential leadership, especially in contrast to that of President Trump, who had spent weeks downplaying the threat that the coronavirus presented.“You have to throw the entire playbook out the window and focus on what people care about because the agenda has shifted dramatically since they were last onstage together,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic communications strategist who worked for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington during his 2020 presidential bid. “It’s like you were preparing to pitch in the World Series and suddenly you found yourself at bat at a key moment. The dynamics have totally shifted.”Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who worked on the Obama campaigns, said moments like this are when “voters want to see leaders, not politicians,” warning against anything that would look like “petty politics.” Debates are often unpredictable, but it is especially hard to game out how this debate featuring a moderate standard-bearer and a liberal challenger will unfold and how people will process it.

And in a new moment of “social distancing” should these two septuagenarian men who are in an at-risk age group make a gesture of doing something else entirely — like an elbow bump? “This is a time for leadership and demonstrating that you have the judgment and vision to fix the incompetence that we’re seeing out of the White House,” Ms. Cutter said. “That is job No. 1 in this debate.”Then there are less consequential questions: Will Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, shake hands? And in a new moment of “social distancing” should these two septuagenarian men who are in an at-risk age group make a gesture of doing something else entirely — like an elbow bump? The state of the race itself has been fundamentally upended since the last debate, too.Back then — less than three weeks ago — Mr. Sanders had won the most votes in three consecutive contests and was threatening to seize control of the nominating contest. Now, Mr. Biden has romped through two straight weeks of sizable victories, so much so that Mr. Sanders’s campaign is facing what experts see as a nearly insurmountable delegate climb.Mr. Sanders now trails Mr. Biden by more than 150 delegates after losing four states last Tuesday and 10 the week before. His defeats were so thorough in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan (a state Mr. Sanders won four years ago) that he trailed in every county. The states that vote next week — Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona — are challenging for Mr. Sanders, as well.That difficult math might typically suggest an aggressive new posture for Mr. Sanders, who needs a real restructuring of the race to be successful. But his speech after last week’s disappointing elections — “we are losing the debate over electability” — was widely interpreted as an effort at de-escalation, as he pressed Mr. Biden to win over his liberal supporters on issues ranging from the environment to student debt, repeatedly asking “Joe, what are you going to do?”In his own speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden offered an olive branch to Mr. Sanders and his supporters, thanking them for their contributions to the contest.

Mr. Coons expected more of that approach on Sunday. “I suspect that we will see Joe say he wants to work with Bernie on some of his policy proposals,” Mr. Coons said. But, he said, “if Bernie insists on simply picking up tools and swinging at Joe the whole time, I think it will be harder to do that.”“They have a shared fundamental goal of preventing Donald Trump’s election and the longer that Bernie Sanders spends attacking Joe Biden the more likely he is to undermine the strength of his candidacy against Donald Trump in the fall,” Mr. Coons added.Still, for Mr. Sanders, the rapid spread of the coronavirus and the predicted shortcomings of America’s medical system are shining a spotlight on his signature issue: a universal and government-run health care system.“It’s obviously a health care crisis and so Bernie’s longstanding support for providing affordable health care for everyone through ‘Medicare for all’ is particularly relevant today,” said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Mr. Sanders. “And he is consistently seen as the most trusted candidate on health care.”Mr. Tulchin said the coronavirus’s economic fallout would shape the debate to Mr. Sanders’s benefit, too.“Bernie has a lot of credibility talking about economic issues especially for those being left behind in today’s economy and there are soon going to be millions of more people facing financial challenges,” Mr. Tulchin added. “There are millions of workers who don’t have paid sick leave, millions of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, and if you’re out of work for a few weeks that is potentially catastrophic.”The two candidates offered a preview of their contrasting approaches to the crisis in a pair of speeches on Thursday.

Standing in front of a row of American flags, in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden adopted the scene and serious tone of a statesman, calling for collective action as a country. “The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,’’ he said. “It will affect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike and will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or ZIP code.”Mr. Sanders, speaking from Burlington, Vt., with the state and American flags positioned in front of “Bernie” signage, warned starkly of casualties that could top World War II, while pivoting to his central message of the urgent need for universal health care.“Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on Earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,” Mr. Sanders said.

"For Joseph R. Biden Jr., campaigning these days means virtual fund-raisers. Field offices shuttered. And rallying support by live stream, a tactic vulnerable to severe technological difficulties, as he discovered on Friday evening.As the sound cut in and out and the audio often came out garbled, Mr. Biden sought to host what his campaign had called a “virtual town hall with Illinois,” in which he spoke to supporters and voters via video in place of an originally scheduled Chicago get-out-the-vote event — or at least, that was the goal.“I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,” Mr. Biden said as he wrapped up his final answer, to a question about whether he supports the Endangered Species Act. (He does, he said. “Oh, I love you,” the questioner replied.) “There’s a lot more to say, but I’ve probably said too much to you,” Mr. Biden added.As the nation confronts the coronavirus crisis, the presidential candidates are facing a new challenge to their pursuit of the Democratic nomination: how to connect with voters during the height of the presidential primary campaign — from a safe distance. Both Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, his chief rival in the primaries, have had to pull back from large-scale events this week and allow their staff members to work from home. For Joseph R.

Both Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, his chief rival in the primaries, have had to pull back from large-scale events this week and allow their staff members to work from home. In an internal memo, Biden senior leadership on Thursday announced a series of other measures, including closing all campaign offices and campaign headquarters to the public, turning fund-raisers into virtual fund-raisers — “indefinitely” — and relying on “smaller events like roundtables, house parties and press statements, as well as virtual events, like tomorrow’s virtual town hall.”
The limits of such an approach were on vivid display by Friday night.“Am I on camera?” Mr. Biden, 77, could be overheard asking at one point. At another, he spoke into what appeared to be a phone that he held in his hand, and was captured pacing around. At times he looked visibly annoyed, and at other moments he was obscured by an image that read, “Illinois for Biden.”The first questioner remarked only that “Mr. Biden’s speech was garbled the entire time.” The second questioner “seems to have dropped,” an organizer of the event said.“Thank you for your patience as we continue developing our virtual town halls and ensure voters have the opportunity to connect with Vice President Biden as he lays out his vision for America,” read a statement from the campaign sent to reporters later Friday evening.Yet behind the technological challenges was evidence of the anxiety Americans are feeling about the virus — and the ways that the outbreak has overtaken the 2020 contest.

According to prepared remarks circulated by the campaign, Mr. Biden began the town hall event by discussing the virus, detailing his vision for fighting it and praising the deal reached between the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the White House on a coronavirus relief package. He was also joined at the virtual town hall by Vivek Murthy, the former United States surgeon general who is part of Mr. Biden’s public health advisory committee.“We will overcome this moment,” the prepared remarks for Mr. Biden said. “That will require all of us to be prudent and proactive. It is the responsibility of each of us to protect our families, our co-workers and our neighbors — especially those that are most vulnerable to serious health outcomes. And campaign events are no exception. That’s why we’re connecting with you virtually today.”Mr. Biden fielded questions about health care, too, including about how his plan would deal with the “crisis that we’re all facing right now.” He spoke of his proposal to expand Obamacare with a public option, and took a chance to draw a contrast with Mr. Sanders and his support for “Medicare for all,” a sweeping single-payer system that Mr. Biden has suggested would be unfeasible to pass and put in place.“We need to assure people we can do this quickly,” he said.In another reminder of the gravity of the moment, Mr. Biden’s health advisory committee announced on Friday night that he had not been tested for the virus because he had not shown any symptoms nor were they aware of “any relevant contact with an individual who has tested positive.”The Biden campaign was not alone in seeking to navigate the realities of a radically altered presidential campaign trail landscape on Friday.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders had lamented that he had not been able to hold his signature campaign rallies because of prohibitions on large gatherings. He said the campaign would rely “more on our internet capabilities.”Mr. Sanders said that he too, had not been tested for the coronavirus because he had not presented any symptoms and had not, to his knowledge, come in contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus.

"One night this week an urgent appeal went out to a Facebook group of emergency room doctors. “If you were in charge of the Federal response to the Pandemic what would your recommendations be?” asked Dr. Kurt Kloss, a physician based in New York.The question was hardly theoretical. “I have direct channel,” he added, “to person now in charge at White House and have been asked for recommendations.”That person, he said, is Jared Kushner, a top adviser to President Trump who has become increasingly involved in the administration’s response to the coronavirus and is also the brother-in-law of the doctor’s daughter, the model Karlie Kloss. Ms. Kloss is married to Joshua Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s brother and a venture capitalist who in 2012 helped found a start-up insurer called Oscar Health.“Tonight I was asked by Jared through my son-in-law for my recommendations,” Dr. Kloss wrote on Wednesday evening. “That’s when I turned to you guys my fellow BAFERDs for help.” BAFERD is an acronym for emergency room doctors, joined by a number of expletives.

Screenings, Dr. Kloss mused, could be done over telemedecine-based video services.In recent days, Jared Kushner has assumed large portions of the portfolio managing the coronavirus crisis and by Dr. Kloss’s account, was highly interested in the doctors’ recommendations.In a series of follow-up posts on Wednesday evening, Dr. Kloss posted updates to the Facebook group, which includes more than 20,000 medical professionals. “Jared is reading now,” one message said.Dr. Kloss ended the post with the phrase “got to turn this in now,” though a series of commenters who apparently knew his connection to the Trump administration urged him to send the list of ideas to the president.

"WASHINGTON — The entire federal appeals court in Washington said on Friday that it would take up two cases that raised the question of whether and when Congress may sue to resolve a dispute with the president, setting up a double-barreled test for establishing when the judicial branch can resolve disputes over separation of powers.In a terse order, the full appeals court said it would rehear a case involving a House Judiciary Committee subpoena to Donald F. McGahn II, President Trump’s former White House counsel, vacating a 2-1 panel ruling last month that Congress could not sue to enforce its subpoenas of executive branch officials.The full court also said it would immediately take up a case that House Democrats brought against Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin challenging the administration’s use of emergency powers and other extraordinary measures to spend more taxpayer funds on Mr. Trump’s border wall with Mexico than Congress had been willing to appropriate.In the border wall case, a United States District Court judge had sided with Mr. Trump and dismissed the case, saying the House had no standing to bring it. An appeals court panel heard arguments in the case weeks ago but has not yet issued a ruling. The order said that the panel had requested that the full court hear that case since it also raised an issue of standing.

The order said that the panel had requested that the full court hear that case since it also raised an issue of standing. The full Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear arguments in both cases on April 28.The cases raise major issues about the scope of the power of Congress to enlist the courts’ aid when lawmakers believe a president is illegally spending funds — defying its constitutional power of the purse — or instructing an aide to illegally ignore a subpoena, defying its constitutional power to conduct oversight of the government.The McGahn subpoena case is particularly important because it could have far-reaching consequences for executive branch secrecy powers long after Mr. Trump leaves office. The now-vacated panel ruling dealt a severe blow to Congress’s ability to conduct oversight when a president is willing to simply stonewall “all” subpoenas, as Mr. Trump has vowed to do.Mr. McGahn was a key witness in the second volume of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, about Mr. Trump’s efforts to obstruct the Russia inquiry. The House wanted to question Mr. McGahn about the same topic.But on Mr. Trump’s instructions, Mr. McGahn defied the House subpoena. The House sued him, seeking a judicial order that he show up to testify, and won in district court in November.

The House sued him, seeking a judicial order that he show up to testify, and won in district court in November. The Justice Department filed an appeal, and last month, two of the three appeals court judges on the panel ruled that the Constitution gave the House no standing to file any such lawsuit in what they characterized as a political dispute with the executive branch — a ruling that, if it stood, would cripple the ability of Congress to investigate current and future presidents.Normally, panels of three judges decide disputes that come before federal appeals courts. But litigants who lose at the panel level can choose to appeal to the entire body to have the case reheard. That can be important when the ideological balance between the three-judge panel and the full court is different.The scope of Congress’s power to conduct oversight and seek judicial redress in disputes with the president has no fixed partisan implications; both major parties trade control of both branches, so sometimes a Republican Congress will be battling a Democratic president.But so far, both cases have followed a pattern at both the district and appellate levels. Every judge who sided with Mr. Trump was a Republican appointee, and every judge who sided with Congress was a Democratic appointee. (In similar cases in the past, however, district court judges have sided against presidents of the same party of the president who appointed them.)Notably, the partisan balance on the full appeals court cuts the other way: Seven of the 11 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents.Still, should the full appeals court determine that the House does have standing to bring the lawsuit and order Mr. McGahn to testify, the Justice Department could again appeal to the Supreme Court. There, five of the nine justices are conservative Republican appointees.Depending on how long the case takes to resolve, the presidential election may take place in the interim.

Some of last weekend’s guests worried it may be a sign of the times and the last party of its sort for a while at Mar-a-Lago. “I hope not,” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, wrote in a text message. “Humans interacting with one another are typically happier and more productive in my experience.”Mr. Gaetz’s experience is a cautionary tale. He attended events at Mar-a-Lago on both Friday and Saturday nights of that first weekend in March, not realizing that he had already been exposed to someone infected with the coronavirus at an earlier political event. Only last Monday, as he rode with Mr. Trump on Air Force One back to Washington was he told, at which point he was separated from the president and other passengers on the plane.

Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami, who met with Mr. Bolsonaro while he was in town, reported on Friday that he had tested positive. Mr. Bolsonaro said Friday that he tested negative, but the health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, later said the president would be tested again as a precaution. Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami, who met with Mr. Bolsonaro while he was in town, reported on Friday that he had tested positive. While he has been described as agitated in private, Mr. Trump has publicly insisted he had no concerns. “I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday before the results were known, referring to questions he received the day before in the Rose Garden. “People were asking, did I take the test.”

His revelation came barely 12 hours after the White House statement released in the name of Cmdr. Sean P. Conley, the president’s physician, rejecting the need for a test since his exposure to Mr. Wajngarten “was extremely limited” and his interactions with Mr. Forster “occurred before any symptom onset.”“These interactions would be categorized as LOW risk for transmission per C.D.C. guidelines, and as such, there is no indication for home quarantine at this time,” Commander Conley wrote. “Additionally, given the president himself remains without symptoms, testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.”The White House did not explain on Saturday why it issued a statement saying no test was needed if the president was in fact taking one.The White House physician’s office on Saturday took Mr. Trump’s temperature before his news briefing — he said it was normal — and began taking the temperature of others in the West Wing who would come into proximity of Mr. Trump, including journalists, one of whom was barred because of high readings.The president has sought for weeks to play down the severity of the outbreak and been especially sensitive about giving the impression that he himself was at risk. Indeed, several advisers to Mr. Trump on Saturday privately expressed irritation at Ms. McDaniel for publicly acknowledging her illness. Since the start of Mr. Trump’s presidency, supporters and hangers-on have gravitated to Mar-a-Lago, paying up to $200,000 for membership in the club — and for proximity to the president. Mr. Trump frequently holds court on the patio at dinnertime, shaking hands with members and waving them over to his table.But the club has been criticized for lax security practices. Last year, a Chinese woman carrying a malware-laced device made it onto the grounds before she was arrested, prompting a rare admonishment from the Secret Service, which effectively blamed the club for porous admission policies.Despite the coronavirus, the president has not changed his practice of greeting guests, according to a member. Mr. Trump believes his willingness to shake hands and connect with supporters helped propel him into office and the club’s unwritten rule is that those who love him or trade on connections with him can come into contact with him.This rule was on display last weekend in the club’s ballroom, when the president hosted both Mr. Bolsonaro for dinner and the extended Trump family for Ms. Guilfoyle’s birthday, the two events overlapping to some extent. As Mr. Trump escorted Mr. Bolsonaro into the club, a reporter asked if newly reported coronavirus cases in the Washington area made him worry that it was getting closer to the White House.“No,” he said with Mr. Bolsonaro at his side, “I’m not concerned at all.”And then the two went inside.ImageA picture posted on Instagram by Mr. Bolsonaro’s press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten.Credit...via Associated Press Since the start of Mr. Trump’s presidency, supporters and hangers-on have gravitated to Mar-a-Lago, paying up to $200,000 for membership in the club — and for proximity to the president.

Ms. Guilfoyle, wearing a thigh-hugging gold sequin dress and set to turn 50 two days later, was toasted by one member of the Trump family after another amid purple and pink lighting suffusing the room.“You work so hard for the president,” Ivanka Trump told her. “It’s been amazing to get to know you,” Mr. Kushner added. Mr. Graham told her that “you represent everything Bernie Sanders hates” and promised to get her a tax cut. With a D.J. playing music, the guests danced a conga line and enjoyed the evening. Even Robert C. O’Brien, the president’s national security adviser, hung around for the toasts, which some of his colleagues thought was out of place.

He said the organizers, not the club, made the call. “They understand,” Mr. Scott said. “They know that we’re going to reschedule there.”Jeff Greene, a Mar-a-Lago member until 2018, said Palm Beachers were likely to sequester themselves unless Mr. Trump visited. As news of the virus spread, he said, more people were refraining from dining out or socializing.“Mar-a-Lago is really mostly busy when the president’s in town,” Mr. Greene said. “People aren’t going anywhere now.”Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, Ernesto Londoño from Buenos Aires, and Letícia Casado from São Paulo.

"WASHINGTON — It started as a series of conversations this past week between officials working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and the chief executive of Verily, a life sciences subsidiary of Google’s parent company, about how it might help the Trump administration in the fight against the coronavirus.Verily was developing a website that could let people evaluate their symptoms and direct them to nearby “drive through” locations for testing. Desperate to tap the private sector to satisfy the public’s demands for a more robust response to the rapidly spreading virus, Mr. Kushner was quickly sold on the idea.But on Friday, President Trump inflated the concept far beyond reality. At a news conference in the Rose Garden, he said that the company was helping to develop a website that would sharply expand testing for the virus, falsely claiming that “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now” and adding that “they’ve made tremendous progress.”In truth, the project at Verily — which has a total of about 1,000 employees — is in its infancy.

At a news conference in the Rose Garden, he said that the company was helping to develop a website that would sharply expand testing for the virus, falsely claiming that “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now” and adding that “they’ve made tremendous progress.”In truth, the project at Verily — which has a total of about 1,000 employees — is in its infancy. A pilot program is planned for the San Francisco area, but a website has yet to be unveiled. Testing locations have not been identified, and the coronavirus tests themselves are not yet widely available. The president’s effort to sell the website as a significant response to an urgent public health crisis came amid a national outcry over the administration’s repeated failures to deliver on promises to quickly expand access to testing for the virus. The disconnect between Mr. Trump’s exuberant comments and the project’s more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about his administration’s response to the virus, even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress.In the hours after the president’s remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely “in the early stages of development.” The 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.Now, with Google executives eager to show they are working with the president, the company is racing to meet the promise even as they acknowledge that the debut of the website will be far more limited than Mr. Trump has suggested. A person familiar with the project said Verily was planning to start on Monday with a website that could direct people in the San Francisco Bay Area to as many as three virus testing locations.

Mr. Pence told reporters on Saturday that “the objective here is to have a website up very quickly,” and promised that more details about the partnership with Google would be revealed on Sunday. He said the website would initially be used “in the areas that have been deeply impacted — Washington State, California, New York.”Mr. Trump has repeatedly made statements about efforts to combat the virus that are wrong. Even as testing was severely limited, he said that “anyone who wants a test can get one.” He suggested the country was “very close to a vaccine,” despite evidence from health experts that one is probably at least a year away. And he stated he “closed” travel from Europe even though Americans and legal residents are exempted.  This account of the president’s embrace of a Google-backed website as a tool for fighting the virus is based on interviews with administration officials and Google employees familiar with the project, and the communications between the company and the White House.In the past 10 days, Mr. Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to the president, has taken an increasingly central role in Mr. Trump’s response to the virus. He helped draft the president’s prime-time address this week from the Oval Office, which drew widespread criticism for its repeated errors and misleading statements. He has also reached out to Dr. Kurt Kloss, a physician based in New York, for advice. Dr. Kloss is the father of Karlie Kloss, who is married to Joshua Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s brother.Administration officials said people close to Mr. Kushner had been in touch with Andy Conrad, the chief executive at Verily, earlier in the week about whether the subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, could somehow help with testing. Mr. Conrad, who is known within Alphabet as an executive with an independent streak, described the yet unnamed website to them.Mr. Kushner, who has led the government’s outreach to the technology community, liked the idea, according to one administration official. He directed his team to work with Mr. Conrad and others at Verily on how their original project might be adapted to help fight the virus.At that point, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, was not involved in the discussions, according to people familiar with the situation. Mr. Pichai contacted Mr. Conrad on Wednesday, after an employee asked a question during one of the company’s all-staff meetings about whether Verily could help with testing.In a memo to his staff the next day, Mr. Pichai wrote that “a planning effort” was underway at Verily to use its expertise in clinical research to aid in the testing.“As more test kits become available, the planners are looking to develop a pathway for public health and health care agencies,” Mr. Pichai wrote, adding that the effort was targeted at making sure that “individuals who are at higher risk can be directed to testing sites based on the latest guidance from public health authorities.” This account of the president’s embrace of a Google-backed website as a tool for fighting the virus is based on interviews with administration officials and Google employees familiar with the project, and the communications between the company and the White House.In the past 10 days, Mr. Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to the president, has taken an increasingly central role in Mr. Trump’s response to the virus.

Over the next day, more than 1,700 signed up, a number that was communicated to Mr. Kushner’s team.On Friday, reeling from the collapse of the stock markets and warnings by health experts of the virus’s rapid spread, Mr. Trump scheduled an afternoon news conference.In the hours before the president’s appearance, Mr. Kushner’s team prepared a poster showing how the website might work; it did not mention Google specifically, but a flow chart showed that a “screening website” could provide “new options for consumers” around the country as they seek to find out whether they are infected.During the news conference, Mr. Trump was enthusiastic.“I want to thank Google — Google is helping to develop a website,” he said. “It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”Moments later, at Mr. Trump’s invitation, Dr. Deborah L.

"For the first time in the long Democratic primary campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet in a one-on-one debate, facing off Sunday night as Mr. Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy against a rival who has taken a commanding position in the race. But that isn’t why this debate is different from most others in modern politics.Both men will be auditioning for the presidency amid an unfolding national emergency over the coronavirus; the last candidates to debate in such urgent circumstances were Barack Obama and John McCain during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Sanders will be under added pressure to show why he is still running, at a time when people are worried about far more than presidential politics, while Mr. Biden — often uneven in these debate settings — must navigate far more speaking time as he tries to appear capable of uniting the country and leading it through a crisis.

There will be no live audience and no spin room. One moderator who had potentially been exposed to the virus has bowed out to avoid  spreading it. Debates are often unpredictable, but it is especially hard to game out how this debate featuring a moderate standard-bearer and a liberal challenger will unfold and how people will process it. Hundreds of thousands of viewers, if not millions, will have been personally affected by Sunday, as public gathering spaces are shuttered, schools are closed and on Thursday the stock market plunged by the largest percentage in decades (it snapped back upward on Friday).“It is going to be a different kind of debate,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, an early ally and surrogate for Mr. Biden, said with more than a little understatement.The extraordinary situation offers an unusual challenge and opportunity. It will provide a national platform and audience for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders to preview their own brands of presidential leadership, especially in contrast to that of President Trump, who had spent weeks downplaying the threat that the coronavirus presented.“You have to throw the entire playbook out the window and focus on what people care about because the agenda has shifted dramatically since they were last onstage together,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic communications strategist who worked for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington during his 2020 presidential bid. “It’s like you were preparing to pitch in the World Series and suddenly you found yourself at bat at a key moment. The dynamics have totally shifted.”Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who worked on the Obama campaigns, said moments like this are when “voters want to see leaders, not politicians,” warning against anything that would look like “petty politics.” Debates are often unpredictable, but it is especially hard to game out how this debate featuring a moderate standard-bearer and a liberal challenger will unfold and how people will process it.

And in a new moment of “social distancing” should these two septuagenarian men who are in an at-risk age group make a gesture of doing something else entirely — like an elbow bump? The state of the race itself has been fundamentally upended since the last debate, too.Back then — less than three weeks ago — Mr. Sanders had won the most votes in three consecutive contests and was threatening to seize control of the nominating contest. Now, Mr. Biden has romped through two straight weeks of sizable victories, so much so that Mr. Sanders’s campaign is facing what experts see as a nearly insurmountable delegate climb.Mr. Sanders now trails Mr. Biden by more than 150 delegates after losing four states last Tuesday and 10 the week before. His defeats were so thorough in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan (a state Mr. Sanders won four years ago) that he trailed in every county. The states that vote next week — Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona — are challenging for Mr. Sanders, as well.That difficult math might typically suggest an aggressive new posture for Mr. Sanders, who needs a real restructuring of the race to be successful. But his speech after last week’s disappointing elections — “we are losing the debate over electability” — was widely interpreted as an effort at de-escalation, as he pressed Mr. Biden to win over his liberal supporters on issues ranging from the environment to student debt, repeatedly asking “Joe, what are you going to do?”In his own speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden offered an olive branch to Mr. Sanders and his supporters, thanking them for their contributions to the contest.

Mr. Coons expected more of that approach on Sunday. “I suspect that we will see Joe say he wants to work with Bernie on some of his policy proposals,” Mr. Coons said. But, he said, “if Bernie insists on simply picking up tools and swinging at Joe the whole time, I think it will be harder to do that.”“They have a shared fundamental goal of preventing Donald Trump’s election and the longer that Bernie Sanders spends attacking Joe Biden the more likely he is to undermine the strength of his candidacy against Donald Trump in the fall,” Mr. Coons added.Still, for Mr. Sanders, the rapid spread of the coronavirus and the predicted shortcomings of America’s medical system are shining a spotlight on his signature issue: a universal and government-run health care system.“It’s obviously a health care crisis and so Bernie’s longstanding support for providing affordable health care for everyone through ‘Medicare for all’ is particularly relevant today,” said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Mr. Sanders. “And he is consistently seen as the most trusted candidate on health care.”Mr. Tulchin said the coronavirus’s economic fallout would shape the debate to Mr. Sanders’s benefit, too.“Bernie has a lot of credibility talking about economic issues especially for those being left behind in today’s economy and there are soon going to be millions of more people facing financial challenges,” Mr. Tulchin added. “There are millions of workers who don’t have paid sick leave, millions of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, and if you’re out of work for a few weeks that is potentially catastrophic.”The two candidates offered a preview of their contrasting approaches to the crisis in a pair of speeches on Thursday.

Standing in front of a row of American flags, in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden adopted the scene and serious tone of a statesman, calling for collective action as a country. “The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,’’ he said. “It will affect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike and will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or ZIP code.”Mr. Sanders, speaking from Burlington, Vt., with the state and American flags positioned in front of “Bernie” signage, warned starkly of casualties that could top World War II, while pivoting to his central message of the urgent need for universal health care.“Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on Earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,” Mr. Sanders said.

Have other states changed their primaries in response to the coronavirus?No. Or at least, not yet.The four states with elections coming up on Tuesday — Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois — have taken other precautions to make voting safer without shifting the date of their primaries. It is possible, however, that some later-voting states could follow the example of Louisiana and Georgia.While such last-minute changes are highly unusual, states have broad autonomy to define the timing and procedures for primary elections. The exact process for setting primary dates varies from state to state. That is why a number of states changed the dates of their primaries and caucuses between 2016 and 2020, and why Republicans in several states were able to cancel their 2020 primary elections to minimize intraparty competition for President Trump.

That is why a number of states changed the dates of their primaries and caucuses between 2016 and 2020, and why Republicans in several states were able to cancel their 2020 primary elections to minimize intraparty competition for President Trump. But the Democratic Party also has its own rules requiring that all primary elections be completed by June 9, and that all delegates to its national convention in Milwaukee be selected by June 20. Any states that defy that timetable — including Louisiana — could be penalized by the national party with a reduction in their delegate count.

Could the general election be postponed or canceled?Only with enormous difficulty.The date of the general election is set by federal law and has been fixed since 1845. It would take a change in federal law to move that date. That would mean legislation enacted by Congress, signed by the president and subject to challenge in the courts.To call that unlikely would be an understatement.And even if all of that happened, there would not be much flexibility in choosing an alternate election date: The Constitution mandates that the new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s term must begin on Jan. 20. Those dates cannot be changed just by the passage of normal legislation.After Louisiana’s announcement on Friday, Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer, knocked down what he described as a wave of queries about whether the November election could be similarly revised.“I am getting a lot of questions about the November election,” Mr. Elias wrote on Twitter. “While states can set their own primary days, the federal general election is set by federal statute as the the [sic] Tuesday following the first Monday in November. This date cannot be changed by a state nor by the President.” Can the president cancel or postpone an election with an executive order?No. The president has a lot of power, but when it comes to elections he is far more constrained than the governor of Louisiana. Can the president cancel or postpone an election with an executive order?No. The president has a lot of power, but when it comes to elections he is far more constrained than the governor of Louisiana. What about the procedures for voting in the November election?While the date of the presidential election is set by federal law, the procedures for voting are generally controlled at the state level.That’s why we have such a complicated patchwork of voting regulations, with some states allowing early and absentee voting; some permitting voting by mail or same-day voter registration; others requiring certain kinds of identification for voters; and many states doing few or none of those things.So it is possible that states could revise their voting procedures in response to a public health crisis, perhaps by making it easier to vote by mail or through various absentee procedures that would not require people to cluster together on one particular date.Washington State, a focal point for the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, has conducted elections by mail for years, and its presidential primary on March 10 was able to unfold without disruption.The federal government could also take steps to mandate or encourage different voting procedures, without changing the timing of the election. Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, has proposed that Congress require states to offer “no excuse absentee balloting” for the general election, so that anyone can opt to vote by a method besides in-person voting on Election Day.

Have American elections been moved because of emergencies in the past?Yes, at the state and local level.Perhaps most notably, the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks came on the morning of a municipal primary election in New York City, and the state Legislature passed emergency legislation postponing the election by two weeks. In 2017, some municipal elections in Florida were briefly delayed because of Hurricane Irma.

His plan would, however, forgive the remaining balance for people who paid 5 percent of their discretionary income (with the first $25,000 exempt) toward their loans for 20 years.SandersMr. Sanders wants to make all public colleges and universities free, cancel all student loan debt — about $1.6 trillion owed by about 45 million Americans — and cap student loan interest rates at 1.88 percent. He says he would pay for the debt cancellation with a tax on financial transactions like stock trades. Climate changeBidenMr. Biden’s $1.7 trillion climate plan calls for 100 percent carbon-free energy and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It would end fossil fuel subsidies and subsidize clean energy, but envisions a continued role for fossil fuels for some time: It would not ban fracking, for instance. Mr. Biden also supports federal funding for carbon capture and sequestration programs that could, in theory, eventually offset some emissions.SandersMr. Sanders is a proponent of the Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution that calls for aggressive action to combat climate change, and has modeled his $16.3 trillion proposal on that plan. He calls for an immediate ban on fracking, for the electricity and transportation sectors to be carbon-free by 2030, and for the United States to end the use of fossil fuels no later than 2050.

ImmigrationBidenMr. Biden wants to undo the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies, reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, he would not decriminalize unauthorized border crossings, but he is calling for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and says he would deport only people who have committed a serious crime.SandersMr. Sanders has called for a moratorium on deportations pending a review of the current immigration system. He also supports the reinstatement and expansion of the DACA program, which protected from deportation people who were brought into the United States as children.In addition, he has backed the movement to abolish federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.Mass incarcerationBidenCriminal justice is a fraught issue for Mr. Biden, who helped pass laws, like the 1994 crime bill, that produced mass incarceration to begin with. He has made a stark reversal on the issue during this campaign, calling for incentives for states to shift from incarceration to crime prevention, an end to mandatory minimum sentences and the death penalty, and decriminalizing marijuana.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, however, he does not want to legalize marijuana.SandersMr. Sanders has promised to cut the national prison population in half and end mass incarceration. To do that, he wants to abolish the death penalty, three-strikes laws and mandatory minimum sentences, among other measures.Gun controlBidenMr. Biden supports an assault weapons ban, a voluntary buyback program and a ban on online gun sales, as well as a slew of proposals that are nearly universal among Democratic candidates now, like background checks and red-flag laws. He is also calling for incentives for states to enact gun licensing programs.

SandersMr. Sanders, like Mr. Biden, supports an assault weapons ban, a voluntary buyback program and many other gun restrictions. But much like criminal justice for Mr. Biden, gun control is a difficult area for Mr. Sanders, politically speaking: Earlier in his career, he voted against federal background checks and legal liability for gun manufacturers.AbortionBidenMr. Biden has a long and complicated record on abortion. In the 1980s, he supported an attempt to let states overturn Roe v. Wade, and he supported the Hyde Amendment — which prevents Medicaid from covering abortion in most circumstances — until just last year.Today, however, he supports the same basic set of policies every major Democrat in the race did, including legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, repeals of the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic “gag rules,” and a pledge to nominate only Supreme Court justices who support abortion rights.SandersMr. Sanders also supports legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, opposes the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic gag rules, and has promised to nominate only Supreme Court justices who would uphold Roe v. Wade.HomelessnessBidenMr. Biden is proposing $640 billion over 10 years for affordable housing, as well as a “bill of rights” that would provide protections against eviction, foreclosure and predatory mortgages. He also wants to create tax credits for renters and first-time homeowners and expand the Section 8 housing voucher program.SandersMr. Sanders proposes spending $2.5 trillion to build about 10 million permanently affordable housing units. He also wants to implement a national rent control standard and spend $70 billion to repair public housing.Money in politicsBidenMr. Biden is calling for a constitutional amendment to make elections completely publicly funded, eliminating all private contributions — a significant step beyond what Mr. Sanders has proposed. In the shorter term, he wants to put new restrictions on super PACs and publicly finance major parties’ national conventions.

He is also calling, like many Democrats, for a $15 minimum wage, and for higher taxes on corporations and wealthy investors.SandersMr. Sanders has suggested taxing the rich with a wealth tax and progressive estate tax while also enacting a federal jobs guarantee, doubling union membership and taking other steps to bolster the working and middle class.

"In October 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders was whisked into Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s residence at the Naval Observatory for a breakfast of yogurt parfaits and caffeinated campaign advice from a vice president who had just announced his (temporary) retirement from presidential politics.The meeting, according to aides, lasted longer than expected, nearly two hours, with Mr. Biden discoursing on campaign strategy and a range of policy issues, and expressing admiration for a Sanders political operation that was waging an unexpectedly tough fight against Hillary Clinton.When Mr. Biden walked Mr. Sanders to his car, he clapped a hand on his shoulder and declared, “Good luck, buddy!” In October 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders was whisked into Joseph R.

Depending on how the night goes, the confrontation could be either a swan song for Mr. Sanders, who has suffered a string of crushing primary defeats this month, or a chance for the onetime front-runner to reassert his rationale for extending the contest.

Depending on how the night goes, the confrontation could be either a swan song for Mr. Sanders, who has suffered a string of crushing primary defeats this month, or a chance for the onetime front-runner to reassert his rationale for extending the contest. Mr. Sanders, speaking after last week’s losses in Michigan and three other states, telegraphed his intention to press Mr. Biden hard on health care, climate change and income inequality. Yet the actions of both men in the aftermath of Tuesday’s primaries — Mr. Biden set out a welcome mat for his rival rather than pressuring him to quit, and Mr. Sanders outlined tough terms for an eventual détente — also shed light on a personal relationship that has remained sturdy, amicable and functional, a far cry from the acrimony that defined Mr. Sanders’s relationship with Mrs. Clinton after their bitter duel four years ago.This no-frills personal connection, aides to both men say, could become an important factor in quickly uniting the party to confront President Trump, despite the wide policy gulf between the moderate Mr. Biden and the progressive Mr. Sanders.“I think both men know where this is likely going, and they both know how to approach one another,” said David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Barack Obama who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the White House. “Sanders, it seems to me, is a guy who wants to land the plane, and is asking Biden to show him some lights from the ground. There’s nothing personal standing in the way of them getting together.” Mr. Sanders, speaking after last week’s losses in Michigan and three other states, telegraphed his intention to press Mr. Biden hard on health care, climate change and income inequality.

Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005).But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.” Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden’s ascent to the vice presidency in 2009.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has battled with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the past over the issue of bankruptcy, now supports a plan by Ms. Warren to make changes to the bankruptcy system, his presidential campaign confirmed on Saturday.Mr. Biden would work toward putting in place her bankruptcy plan as president, and he could address the issue at greater length in Sunday night’s debate, Biden advisers said.It is the latest sign that Mr. Biden, fresh off a string of victories, is looking for ways to engage younger and more liberal voters who have remained skeptical of his candidacy, and it reflects a recognition among his allies that he will need enthusiastic support from progressives in a general election should he become the Democratic nominee.The move also comes amid speculation over whether Ms. Warren, who dropped out of the race this month, will issue an endorsement of Mr. Biden or of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, his chief rival for the nomination, or whether she sits out the primary entirely.

He added that the bankruptcy issue was a possible area of agreement with Mr. Sanders. And on Saturday, the National Education Association — which, at around three million members, is the nation’s largest labor union — said it was endorsing Mr. Biden to be the Democratic nominee.The clash between Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden over the nation’s bankruptcy system took place more than a decade ago, when Ms. Warren was a Harvard law professor and Mr. Biden was a senator from Delaware. Ms. Warren was a vocal opponent of a 2005 bankruptcy overhaul that Mr. Biden supported. The bankruptcy legislation ultimately passed and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.On the day Mr. Biden entered the presidential race last year, Ms. Warren jabbed him over the issue, saying that he had sided with the credit card companies when she was fighting for consumers.In January, as a presidential candidate, Ms. Warren laid out a plan to roll back provisions in the 2005 bill, which she said was “terrible for families in need.” Her plan seeks to make it easier for people to go through the bankruptcy process, and it would allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy like other debts. “I’ve endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy proposal, which in fact goes further, allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy,”  Mr. Biden said in a virtual town-hall-style event on Friday night as he talked about the importance of access to education.

Mr. Biden’s remark about endorsing the bankruptcy plan came in response to a question about what he would do to engage supporters of Mr. Sanders. The two men will face off one-on-one in a debate on Sunday.“Bernie and I agree on a whole range of issues,” Mr. Biden said, pointing to subjects including climate change and education, and stressing his willingness to support Mr. Sanders if he is the nominee. Mr. Biden said he also hoped that the choice would be “a matter of alternatives.”“You know, you may not agree with every detail that I propose, but the fact is that it’s awfully difficult to conclude that I’m anywhere near Donald Trump,” he said.In its endorsement of Mr. Biden for the Democratic nomination, the statement from the National Education Association cited Mr. Biden’s education plans and said that he and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden — herself a member of the organization — “have consistently reached out to N.E.A. members across the country building the broad support among N.E.A. members.”The N.E.A. endorsement comes on the weekend before a slate of large, delegate-rich states — Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona — are scheduled to hold primaries. In those states, the organization plans to run a comprehensive outreach effort including digital advertising and to mobilize members to volunteer to support Mr. Biden.“As president, he is committed to attracting and retaining the best educators by paying them as the professionals that they are as well as increasing funding for support staff and paraprofessionals,” said Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the organization, calling him a “tireless advocate for public education” and “the partner that students and educators need now in the White House.” Mr. Biden’s remark about endorsing the bankruptcy plan came in response to a question about what he would do to engage supporters of Mr. Sanders.

In those states, the organization plans to run a comprehensive outreach effort including digital advertising and to mobilize members to volunteer to support Mr. Biden.“As president, he is committed to attracting and retaining the best educators by paying them as the professionals that they are as well as increasing funding for support staff and paraprofessionals,” said Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the organization, calling him a “tireless advocate for public education” and “the partner that students and educators need now in the White House.”","Biden, Looking to Attract Progressives, Endorses Warren Bankruptcy PlanThe two clashed over bankruptcy policy more than a decade ago.

"Georgia will postpone its March 24 presidential primary election for nearly two months, officials said Saturday, becoming the second state to delay voting in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The move comes as officials in the next four states scheduled to vote in the primary — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — have all indicated they intend to hold their elections on Tuesday as planned, issuing a joint statement on Friday expressing confidence that ballots can be safely cast.Louisiana on Friday became the first state to postpone its primary, announcing that the April 4 election would be pushed back by more than two months.Georgia followed a day later, adding to the uncertainty that is upending the presidential race as people worry about gatherings and places where they might become infected and the candidates adjust to a new normal of “virtual campaigning.” Georgia will postpone its March 24 presidential primary election for nearly two months, officials said Saturday, becoming the second state to delay voting in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The move comes as officials in the next four states scheduled to vote in the primary — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — have all indicated they intend to hold their elections on Tuesday as planned, issuing a joint statement on Friday expressing confidence that ballots can be safely cast.Louisiana on Friday became the first state to postpone its primary, announcing that the April 4 election would be pushed back by more than two months.Georgia followed a day later, adding to the uncertainty that is upending the presidential race as people worry about gatherings and places where they might become infected and the candidates adjust to a new normal of “virtual campaigning.” The Georgia primary will now be held May 19, Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, said in a statement.“Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Mr. Raffensperger said. “Given these circumstances, I believe it is necessary and prudent to suspend in-person voting in the presidential primary, and the local elections associated with them.”May 19 is the day of a previously scheduled election in Georgia, with primary elections for U.S. Senate and House races as well as local elections planned.Several other states this week said they were either implementing or considering changes to voting to address the outbreak.Wyoming suspended the in-person portion of its Democratic caucuses, saying residents would be able to either vote by mail or drop off their ballots at a county polling location.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said on Saturday, a week after having contact with multiple people who days later tested positive for the virus.“This evening, I received confirmation that the test is negative,” the physician, Sean P. Conley, said in a statement. “The president remains symptom free.”The announcement capped a week of uncertainty about the status of Mr. Trump’s health, as he decided not to quarantine himself and shook hands with chief executives who visited the White House and held meetings with administration officials working in the West Wing.And it was greeted with immediate skepticism from Mr. Trump’s critics, serving as the latest reminder of how the president is squandering the credibility he needs in a moment of national emergency — especially when it comes to his health. WASHINGTON — President Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said on Saturday, a week after having contact with multiple people who days later tested positive for the virus.“This evening, I received confirmation that the test is negative,” the physician, Sean P. Conley, said in a statement. “The president remains symptom free.”The announcement capped a week of uncertainty about the status of Mr. Trump’s health, as he decided not to quarantine himself and shook hands with chief executives who visited the White House and held meetings with administration officials working in the West Wing.And it was greeted with immediate skepticism from Mr. Trump’s critics, serving as the latest reminder of how the president is squandering the credibility he needs in a moment of national emergency — especially when it comes to his health. Mr. Trump revealed earlier in the day that he had been tested and was awaiting results, a little more than 12 hours after the White House physician said that because the president had no symptoms, a test was not necessary.The result was released hours after Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said she was quarantining at home and awaiting results after experiencing flulike symptoms. Ms. McDaniel had attended a fund-raising event last Friday night at Mar-a-Lago, where she introduced Mr. Trump.On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s almost casual admission at a White House news conference of his decision to get tested — not because of his interactions with Brazilian officials who later tested positive for the virus, but because of news media coverage — raised more questions than it answered.

Mr. Conley issued a letter at 11:55 p.m. on Friday acknowledging that while the president interacted with at least two people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, he was not recommending home quarantine, and “testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.’’It was unclear if Mr. Trump took the test after the letter was released, or if Dr. Conley’s letter was a falsehood, or if the physician was misleading in his formulation that a test for the president was “not currently indicated” — which did not say directly whether Mr. Trump had been tested. In his follow-up statement on Saturday, Dr. Conley said that on Friday night, “after an in-depth discussion with the president regarding Covid-19 testing, he elected to proceed.”“I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday,” Mr. Trump said on Saturday. At his news conference in the Rose Garden a day earlier, the president was pressed repeatedly about whether he would be tested after interacting with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after the two men met in Florida. “People were asking, did I take the test,” he said.A clip of Mr. Trump being pressed on the matter played repeatedly on cable news, and appeared to influence his decision to take one.Mr. Trump left the briefing room before reporters could ask follow-up questions, but the president said that he had taken his temperature and described it as “totally normal.”Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Trump took the test before or after the release of Dr. Conley’s letter, or why Mr. Trump would have taken a test in spite of the advice of his doctor.On Friday, Mr. Trump’s advice to Americans watching his news conference was that “they shouldn’t be jumping to get the test unless it’s necessary,” adding that “but I think they have to listen to their doctors.”A senior administration official said only that while testing was not necessary, Mr. Trump “requested the test, and it was his decision to make his personal medical test public.” In his follow-up statement on Saturday, Dr. Conley said that on Friday night, “after an in-depth discussion with the president regarding Covid-19 testing, he elected to proceed.”“I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday,” Mr. Trump said on Saturday.

Vice President Mike Pence, a senior administration official said, learned only on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had been tested. At the news conference, Mr. Pence was left to handle questions about the president’s decision, some of which he did not appear to know how to answer.Mr. Pence also indicated that he might soon follow the president’s lead. “I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician’s office,” he told reporters. The physician, he said, had previously advised him that he did not need testing.Mr. Trump, who sees strength as the most important quality someone can project, has often equated illness with weakness. Over the past week, he had resisted testing, disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has recommended tests and self-quarantine for anyone who has stood next to someone who had tested positive.Despite having the imprimatur of the highest level of American government, Dr. Conley’s decision not to recommend a test for Mr. Trump, or any sort of isolation, was at odds with the advice of other physicians, as well as medical experts on the administration’s own coronavirus task force.The standard protocol is to ask people exposed to a known coronavirus case to stay home, to monitor their own health and to refrain from their regular activities for 14 days, and to get tested if they develop symptoms, said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.As a head of state leading the nation through a turbulent time, the president has a singular responsibility to safeguard his health, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. By letting a week go by before agreeing to a test, Mr. Gostin said, Mr. Trump “gives exactly the wrong message to the public, and puts himself and his cabinet at risk.”But that decision was in line with the course of action Mr. Trump preferred — avoiding a test whose results could make him face a reality he might not want to acknowledge. It also followed a pattern of Mr. Trump’s career in politics: releasing memos and statements from medical professionals who are willing to say whatever he wants them to say about his health. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, Mr. Trump’s personal physician during the 2016 presidential campaign, later admitted that a flattering doctor’s letter he had released was dictated to him verbatim by Mr. Trump.

Some have been watching for hints in his affect or physical appearance to determine whether he is feeling ill and they are relieved by the negative test result.Mr. Trump, they said, would be unlikely to want to admit feeling under the weather. During the 2016 presidential campaign, when Mr. Trump was battling a cold, aides declined to confirm anything was amiss about his health.

When her town’s state House G.O.P. representative, Micah Van Huss, filed a resolution in January to officially recognize CNN and The Washington Post as “fake news,” she was “embarrassed.” But in this moment, even she doesn’t feel that she can trust the media to present the pandemic’s full picture.“No matter what outlet you go to about this,” she said, “somebody is always taking a side.”Much of Mr. Trump’s success has been fueled by his supporters’ distrust of career government officials. Yet as coronavirus cases multiply, many of those same supporters find themselves placing their faith in institutions like the C.D.C. — confident for perhaps the first time in Mr. Trump’s tenure that the experts on call aren’t out to sabotage the president.In conversations over the course of the past week, as the news and administration action on the virus moved quickly, Mr. Trump’s supporters overwhelmingly have said they trust the president and they trust whom he trusts. They are not, in large part, completely dismissive of the virus, the way some right-wing media outlets have been. But they are comforted because they see the president as a bulwark against outright panic, working with business leaders and experts from within a bureaucracy that both the president and many Republicans still distrust.

Lee Green, a 59-year-old who lives in the Florida retirement community of The Villages and leads the Jewish Conservatives Club there, said she typically gets her news from Facebook, where she is subscribed to updates from outlets like The Daily Wire and The Jerusalem Post. But on Wednesday she struggled to understand why, if the virus was indeed the equivalent of a “bad flu,” schools were closing and events were being canceled.Now, she relies on the C.D.C. website for updates. “I don’t see them as political hacks,” she explained.Ms. Green is confident in the C.D.C., in large part because she believes Mr. Trump is, too. Later in the week, after the president declared a national emergency over the pandemic, her confidence that Mr. Trump was leaning on experts to do what was best for Americans had only soared.“I’m actually even more impressed after today’s press briefing,” she said on Friday, after the president spoke in the Rose Garden, with top health officials and C.E.O.s. “I voted for Trump because he’s a problem solver. And initially he wanted to be super optimistic about everything, but when the experts told him this was a really big deal, he instantly took action.” Mr. Trump and public health officials have often contradicted one another when speaking publicly about the virus.

That feeling persists among some voters even as Mr. Trump’s recent actions, such as declaring a national state of emergency, seem to signal that his administration views the pandemic as more than a bad flu. Yet some of his supporters remain firm that the president’s opponents are using the outbreak for their gain.On Tuesday, a day before the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus a global pandemic, Mark Hammond, a Republican from La Plata, Md., logged into Facebook and marked himself “safe from whatever it is the media wants me to be afraid of today.”“It’s a scare tactic,” he said, of media coverage of the crisis. “Altogether it’s part of a Democratic long game.”Mr. Hammond, who has a home remodeling company and runs a Facebook group called “Patriots Against Impeachment,” said he attended this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., where an attendee tested positive for the virus. When asked if he was worried about becoming infected or about the pandemic generally, Mr. Hammond was clear: “110 percent, no.”“I have not changed one thing in my daily life,” he said, adding that for the past decade he has kept a “ready bag” and six months’ worth of supplies on hand, just in case an emergency arises.For many Trump supporters, this moment is unsettling — though not linked, in their mind, to the president himself.Jeff Schumacher, a 42-year-old realtor, lives in suburban Seattle, so far one of the areas in the nation hardest hit by the virus. He is juggling his work and his three children being at home after schools closed, and is watching supplies dwindle in stores near his home in Everett.

"WASHINGTON — The House passed an emergency relief package Saturday to address the sweeping effects of the coronavirus and cushion the economic blow to the most vulnerable Americans.The legislation includes a series of measures intended to bolster the safety net for families and workers whose livelihoods and health are affected by the virus. With President Trump weighing in late to voice his approval, the Senate is expected to take up the package and could pass it as early as next week.It is unclear how much the package will cost, because the Congressional Budget Office, the independent federal agency that assesses the revenue effects of legislation, did not have time to calculate a price tag.Here’s what’s in the package.There is paid sick leave for workers — but millions aren’t covered.The measure gives some workers two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave, equal to no less than two-thirds of their pay. The provision is aimed at encouraging people to follow the advice of public health officials who have said the best way to contain the spread of the virus is to have anyone experiencing symptoms stay at home. WASHINGTON — The House passed an emergency relief package Saturday to address the sweeping effects of the coronavirus and cushion the economic blow to the most vulnerable Americans.The legislation includes a series of measures intended to bolster the safety net for families and workers whose livelihoods and health are affected by the virus. With President Trump weighing in late to voice his approval, the Senate is expected to take up the package and could pass it as early as next week.It is unclear how much the package will cost, because the Congressional Budget Office, the independent federal agency that assesses the revenue effects of legislation, did not have time to calculate a price tag.Here’s what’s in the package.There is paid sick leave for workers — but millions aren’t covered.The measure gives some workers two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave, equal to no less than two-thirds of their pay. The provision is aimed at encouraging people to follow the advice of public health officials who have said the best way to contain the spread of the virus is to have anyone experiencing symptoms stay at home. But those benefits only apply to employees of businesses with fewer than 500 employees, or the government, who are infected by the virus, quarantined, have a sick family member or are affected by school closings. Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50 employees, if it determines that providing paid leave “would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.”
Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus. Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some public health experts have called for — effectively paying any worker to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.It also excludes “certain health care providers and emergency responders” from the benefit.Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave. The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the outbreak.The paid leave provisions were among the most contentious elements of the legislation. Republicans objected to a proposal by Democrats to establish a permanent paid sick leave entitlement for all families, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private negotiations. The provision would expire in a year, at the insistence of Republicans, and exemptions are available for small businesses.It allows for free coronavirus testing for all, including the uninsured.As the White House moved on Friday to catch up with the surging demand for coronavirus testing, Ms. Pelosi emphasized that “testing, testing, testing” would be the centerpiece of the legislation.The final package includes a number of waivers to allow the costs of tests to be covered by insurance and federal government programs. It also includes a 6.2-percentage point increase in federal payments to Medicaid for states.There is also $64 million for the Indian Health Service to cover the costs of coronavirus diagnostic testing for members of federally recognized Native American tribes. The Department of Veterans Affairs would receive $60 million to provide testing for veterans, while the National Disaster Medical System would receive $1 billion to reimburse the costs of testing and services to people without health insurance.

The package increases funding food assistance programs.The bill includes about $1 billion for food security programs aimed at helping those who may struggle to get access to meals during the pandemic, including those who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, food banks, and the 22 million children who receive free or reduced-price lunch at school.Those new funds include $500 million to help provide nutritious food to low-income pregnant women or mothers with young children who lose their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and $400 million to help local food banks purchase, store and distribute food. There is also $100 million to provide nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands and $250 million to provide additional home-delivered and prepackaged meals to low-income seniors who rely on federal programs.

He waited a beat for the crowd to get it. “That’s a joke!” he exclaimed, when it was apparent few did. “I think it’s very important!”This happens a lot.Mr. Sanders has learned a few things on the campaign trail. He has learned how to attack President Trump by rattling off a series of unflattering descriptions. He has learned how to get people to talk about themselves by asking them to share their struggles with health care. He has also learned how to deliver a punchline.And as he has campaigned in the 2020 race, briefly as a front-runner, then as the only thing standing in the way of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s primary coronation, he has emerged as something very different from the publicly gruff, politically unchanging character he has always played: He has actually become a bit playful.

In addition to his extensive real estate holdings, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he reported having at least $47 million in several checking, savings and money-market accounts.

Now the military allows the 14 former C.I.A. prisoners to walk unencumbered from their cells in two separate blocks, known as Alpha and Bravo, to enclosed open-air, recreation pens. There, they can pray and share meals together, in groups of six or eight. Some prisoners on Bravo block have fashioned a Ping-Pong table. Each block has a cell that the military has converted into a communal pantry with a refrigerator, microwave and spices for meal preparations. With permission from the prison last year, a Marine lawyer donated a $50 leg of lamb to the prisoners, who figured out how to roast it in the microwave.Camp 7, which houses Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other men accused of orchestrating the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, is by far the most mysterious prison at Guantánamo. Both its location and price tag are classified. Lawyers who obtained court orders to see the prison have been transported there in windowless vans.A succession of commanders have sought funding from Congress to replace it, describing the structure as deteriorating and potentially dangerous for the guard force.In the past two years, according to war court testimony and people familiar with the prison, the military has eased the conditions of confinement of Guantánamo’s high-value detainees, six of whom await death-penalty trials. It is a quality-of-life improvement for them that has also reduced the workload of the guards at a time when the military is reducing the number of troops assigned to detention operations at Guantánamo.

Now the troops track the prisoners through cameras and other surveillance during 20 hours a day of what the warden, Col. Steven G. Yamashita, has described as “a communal living arrangement” that is starkly different than their years of isolation and indignity in C.I.A. detention. “They are free to move about most of the day” within the confines of their block, Colonel Yamashita testified at the war court last year. He said he instituted the change when he took charge of the guard force in June 2018, although the decision to do so was made before he took over.Lockdown is generally limited to four hours a day, typically from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. During those periods, the prisoners go inside their 86-square-foot cells, behind two doors, a control room locks them in and the soldiers come onto the blocks. If there is a need, they search a cell or prisoner. They also inspect the food pantry, another communal cell with prison-approved books and videos, and the open-air recreation yard.“There’s been a real relaxation of the circumstances of their confinement that has removed a lot of the absurdly unnecessary restrictions for the previous 10 years,” said Maj. James D. Valentine, a Marine lawyer. He represents two former C.I.A. prisoners who are held as Law of War detainees at the maximum-security prison, meaning neither man is charged with a crime at the war court.Past commanders have described the military’s steady move toward a doctrine of communal confinement at Guantánamo as a reward for following the rules that benefits both the health and safety of the guard force and the detainees. Continuous close contact can be dangerous. Single cell confinement can be mind numbing.“Isolation is too personal and resource intensive,” said Stephen N. Xenakis, a psychiatrist and retired Army brigadier general who treats U.S. war veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder when he is not consulting on detainee cases at Guantánamo. “It’s less of a burden on the staff if they’re taking care of each other. Your community is going to be healthier, easier to manage and safer.”Commanders have said the U.S. military provides no formal torture-survivor treatment for the men in Camp 7, whose lawyers say they suffer sleeplessness, brain injuries, back and joint pain and other disorders they blame on their brutal interrogations while in C.I.A. custody. “They are free to move about most of the day” within the confines of their block, Colonel Yamashita testified at the war court last year.

But Dr. Xenakis said one benefit of communal confinement is that the captives can care for each other. He compared it to “an old concept in military medicine” that was first adopted in psychiatric clinics at Walter Reed Medical Center in 1971, during the Vietnam War, called “milieu therapy.”After a prisoner called Abd al Hadi al Iraqi underwent five spine surgeries in nine months at Guantánamo starting in September 2017, other detainees helped him with his meals, personal hygiene and others aspects of daily life. He relies on a four-wheeled walker to get around, and has to sit in a chair when the other prisoners on Alpha block kneel in prayer.In the summer of 2018, a spokeswoman for the prison at the time described the communal approach as a component of end-of-life care for the men of Camp 7, now aged 32 to 59, who may very well die at Guantánamo Bay.“Picture in your mind elderly detainees, brothers taking care of one another,” said then-Cmdr. Anne E. Leanos of the Navy. “That is the humane way ahead.”Trips from the prison — to court, legal appointments and meetings with the International Red Cross — still require security measures that were once routine within Camp 7: Two to three soldiers with their hands on each captive’s arm as well as a back or shoulder, guiding a prisoner who is shackled at the wrists and ankles.But the Army guards and Navy corpsmen who previously delivered meals, medication and supplies to each detainee through a slot in his cell door, and patrolled the corridor outside each cell’s double steel door are no longer routinely on the cellblocks.Now, it is the detainees who go to the guards, at a sally port at the end of the block, to fetch their deliveries, answer questions and exchange supplies except during the four hours a day they are confined to their cells. It is a style of detention that when put into practice in other portions of the prison years ago decreased friction between the captives and the captors.

The current prison leadership declined to discuss how the easing of conditions has affected prison operations which, military officials say, is undergoing a phased reduction of troops.Last year, some 1,800 soldiers on nine-month tours, mostly National Guard and Reserve forces, were assigned to the detention operation. Guantánamo currently holds 40 prisoners, who are typically spread across three or four different sites, including Camp 7. Now the Southern Command has begun thinning the force, starting with a 12 to 14 percent reduction, according to military officials, in a move that should reduce the more than $13 million a year per-prisoner cost.But the idea of easing conditions at Camp 7 dates back to January 2009, when Adm. Patrick Walsh, vice chief of Naval Operations, evaluated Guantánamo’s compliance with the Geneva Conventions for the Obama administration. The admiral recommended that accommodations be made to let the detainees “communicate with each other from within their cells” and “maximize communal living and recreation interaction within reasonable security concerns.""

The liberalization of life there has manifested itself in a number of ways that may sound small to an outsider but have been described as meaningful for the men after years of deprivation.Prisoners can now wear watches — nondigital models, which have no possibility of tapping into the cellular towers that arrived on base in 2016.Lawyers or the Red Cross can donate them, along with orthopedic and other shoes — no laces allowed.Clothing is no longer uniform. The first man to be waterboarded by the C.I.A., a Palestinian known as Abu Zubaydah, has a change of clothes — hospital-like scrubs — when he works out in the recreation yard.

He attended events at Mar-a-Lago on both Friday and Saturday nights of that first weekend in March, not realizing that he had already been exposed to someone infected with the coronavirus at an earlier political event.

Since the start of Mr. Trump’s presidency, supporters and hangers-on have gravitated to Mar-a-Lago, paying up to $200,000 for membership in the club — and for proximity to the president. Mr. Trump frequently holds court on the patio at dinnertime, shaking hands with members and waving them over to his table.But the club has been criticized for lax security practices. Last year, a Chinese woman carrying a malware-laced device made it onto the grounds before she was arrested, prompting a rare admonishment from the Secret Service, which effectively blamed the club for porous admission policies.Despite the coronavirus, the president has not changed his practice of greeting guests, according to a member. Mr. Trump believes his willingness to shake hands and connect with supporters helped propel him into office and the club’s unwritten rule is that those who love him or trade on connections with him can come into contact with him.This rule was on display last weekend in the club’s ballroom, when the president hosted both Mr. Bolsonaro for dinner and the extended Trump family for Ms. Guilfoyle’s birthday, the two events overlapping to some extent. As Mr. Trump escorted Mr. Bolsonaro into the club, a reporter asked if newly reported coronavirus cases in the Washington area made him worry that it was getting closer to the White House.“No,” he said with Mr. Bolsonaro at his side, “I’m not concerned at all.”And then the two went inside.ImageA picture posted on Instagram by Mr. Bolsonaro’s press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten.Credit...via Associated Press Since the start of Mr. Trump’s presidency, supporters and hangers-on have gravitated to Mar-a-Lago, paying up to $200,000 for membership in the club — and for proximity to the president.

Kerik, the former New York police commissioner recently pardoned by Mr. Trump for tax fraud and false statements.In addition to Donald Trump Jr. and Ms. Guilfoyle, there were other family members present, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Eric Trump and his wife, Lara Trump, and Tiffany Trump. Melania Trump did not make the trip to Florida.Mr. Bolsonaro took photos with the president and others, including Mr. Pence and Mr. Giuliani. “We’re going to have a nice dinner,” Mr. Trump said as he introduced the Brazilian president to Ivanka Trump and Mr. Carlson.As it happened, Mr. Carlson was concerned that the president was not taking the coronavirus seriously enough and talked with him about it during the evening, according to a person informed about the conversation. Two days later, on his Fox show, Mr. Carlson warned viewers: “People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem.” Among the guests on hand was a who’s who of Mr. Trump’s world, according to pictures and video posted on social media, including Vice President Mike Pence, the president’s lawyer Rudolph W.

Ms. Guilfoyle, wearing a thigh-hugging gold sequin dress and set to turn 50 two days later, was toasted by one member of the Trump family after another amid purple and pink lighting suffusing the room.“You work so hard for the president,” Ivanka Trump told her. “It’s been amazing to get to know you,” Mr. Kushner added. Mr. Graham told her that “you represent everything Bernie Sanders hates” and promised to get her a tax cut. With a D.J. playing music, the guests danced a conga line and enjoyed the evening. Even Robert C. O’Brien, the president’s national security adviser, hung around for the toasts, which some of his colleagues thought was out of place.

While Mr. Graham and Senator Rick Scott of Florida later went into self-quarantine because of exposure to the Brazilians, no guests have reported being sick. “The KG birthday party crew continues to keep up with one another,” Mr. Gaetz wrote Friday. “Zero symptoms thus far.”Two attendees said they had not received specific guidance from the club about the event, although others said they received a general notification about precautions to prevent exposure.“They sent out an email saying they’re washing the place down a couple of times a day,” said Bruce Toll, a real estate executive and longtime member of Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Toll was among several members who said that they were not rethinking visiting the club. “I ate breakfast there yesterday with my grandchildren,” he said, “so I’m not worried.”Mar-a-Lago was still open for business on Friday, but Lori Elsbree, the host of a 700-person “celebrity doggie fashion show” and fund-raiser scheduled for Saturday with Lara Trump as honorary chairwoman, said the event had been postponed.Chase Scott, another organizer, said the decision was made after the two cases of coronavirus were confirmed and a state of emergency was issued in Palm Beach County on Friday. He said the organizers, not the club, made the call. “They understand,” Mr. Scott said. “They know that we’re going to reschedule there.”Jeff Greene, a Mar-a-Lago member until 2018, said Palm Beachers were likely to sequester themselves unless Mr. Trump visited. As news of the virus spread, he said, more people were refraining from dining out or socializing.“Mar-a-Lago is really mostly busy when the president’s in town,” Mr. Greene said. “People aren’t going anywhere now.”Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, Ernesto Londoño from Buenos Aires, and Letícia Casado from São Paulo.

"WASHINGTON — It started as a series of conversations this past week between officials working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and the chief executive of Verily, a life sciences subsidiary of Google’s parent company, about how it might help the Trump administration in the fight against the coronavirus.Verily was developing a website that could let people evaluate their symptoms and direct them to nearby “drive through” locations for testing. Desperate to tap the private sector to satisfy the public’s demands for a more robust response to the rapidly spreading virus, Mr. Kushner was quickly sold on the idea.But on Friday, President Trump inflated the concept far beyond reality. At a news conference in the Rose Garden, he said that the company was helping to develop a website that would sharply expand testing for the virus, falsely claiming that “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now” and adding that “they’ve made tremendous progress.”In truth, the project at Verily — which has a total of about 1,000 employees — is in its infancy.

A pilot program is planned for the San Francisco area, but a website has yet to be unveiled. Testing locations have not been identified, and the coronavirus tests themselves are not yet widely available. The president’s effort to sell the website as a significant response to an urgent public health crisis came amid a national outcry over the administration’s repeated failures to deliver on promises to quickly expand access to testing for the virus. The disconnect between Mr. Trump’s exuberant comments and the project’s more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about his administration’s response to the virus, even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress.In the hours after the president’s remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely “in the early stages of development.” The 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.Now, with Google executives eager to show they are working with the president, the company is racing to meet the promise even as they acknowledge that the debut of the website will be far more limited than Mr. Trump has suggested. A person familiar with the project said Verily was planning to start on Monday with a website that could direct people in the San Francisco Bay Area to as many as three virus testing locations.Mr. Pence told reporters on Saturday that “the objective here is to have a website up very quickly,” and promised that more details about the partnership with Google would be revealed on Sunday. He said the website would initially be used “in the areas that have been deeply impacted — Washington State, California, New York.”Mr. Trump has repeatedly made statements about efforts to combat the virus that are wrong. Even as testing was severely limited, he said that “anyone who wants a test can get one.” He suggested the country was “very close to a vaccine,” despite evidence from health experts that one is probably at least a year away. And he stated he “closed” travel from Europe even though Americans and legal residents are exempted.

And he stated he “closed” travel from Europe even though Americans and legal residents are exempted.  This account of the president’s embrace of a Google-backed website as a tool for fighting the virus is based on interviews with administration officials and Google employees familiar with the project, and the communications between the company and the White House.In the past 10 days, Mr. Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to the president, has taken an increasingly central role in Mr. Trump’s response to the virus. He helped draft the president’s prime-time address this week from the Oval Office, which drew widespread criticism for its repeated errors and misleading statements. He has also reached out to Dr. Kurt Kloss, a physician based in New York, for advice. Dr. Kloss is the father of Karlie Kloss, who is married to Joshua Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s brother.Administration officials said people close to Mr. Kushner had been in touch with Andy Conrad, the chief executive at Verily, earlier in the week about whether the subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, could somehow help with testing. Mr. Conrad, who is known within Alphabet as an executive with an independent streak, described the yet unnamed website to them.Mr. Kushner, who has led the government’s outreach to the technology community, liked the idea, according to one administration official. He directed his team to work with Mr. Conrad and others at Verily on how their original project might be adapted to help fight the virus.At that point, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, was not involved in the discussions, according to people familiar with the situation. Mr. Pichai contacted Mr. Conrad on Wednesday, after an employee asked a question during one of the company’s all-staff meetings about whether Verily could help with testing.In a memo to his staff the next day, Mr. Pichai wrote that “a planning effort” was underway at Verily to use its expertise in clinical research to aid in the testing.“As more test kits become available, the planners are looking to develop a pathway for public health and health care agencies,” Mr. Pichai wrote, adding that the effort was targeted at making sure that “individuals who are at higher risk can be directed to testing sites based on the latest guidance from public health authorities.” This account of the president’s embrace of a Google-backed website as a tool for fighting the virus is based on interviews with administration officials and Google employees familiar with the project, and the communications between the company and the White House.In the past 10 days, Mr. Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to the president, has taken an increasingly central role in Mr. Trump’s response to the virus.

He attached a link to a form where Google employees could volunteer to help. Over the next day, more than 1,700 signed up, a number that was communicated to Mr. Kushner’s team.On Friday, reeling from the collapse of the stock markets and warnings by health experts of the virus’s rapid spread, Mr. Trump scheduled an afternoon news conference.In the hours before the president’s appearance, Mr. Kushner’s team prepared a poster showing how the website might work; it did not mention Google specifically, but a flow chart showed that a “screening website” could provide “new options for consumers” around the country as they seek to find out whether they are infected.During the news conference, Mr. Trump was enthusiastic.“I want to thank Google — Google is helping to develop a website,” he said. “It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”Moments later, at Mr. Trump’s invitation, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who is coordinating the response to the virus, held up Mr. Kushner’s poster, saying that it represented a “new approach to testing, which will start in the screening website up here, facilitated by Google.”The initial reaction 3,000 miles away in Silicon Valley was swift.Mr. Trump’s comments caught Google completely off guard and executives rushed to issue a statement on Friday afternoon to temper expectations, making it clear that the website is an effort led by Verily, not Google itself.

Since then, Google executives have scrambled to coordinate with the White House in an effort to do as much as possible to make the president’s vision for the website a reality. On Saturday, Google placed a link on its home page — a rare use of its digital canvass — to encourage people to take steps to prevent spreading the virus.In addition, Google said it was working on a separate “national informational website” to provide information on virus symptoms and testing sites.In a statement, company executives wrote that they are “aligned with the U.S. government to work to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus and to protect the health of our communities.” Administration officials on Saturday sought to play down expectations, saying that the website could provide significant help in the fight against the virus if it operated only in the nine biggest hot spots around the country. One official noted that Mr. Trump never said that the website would operate in every community nationwide.The administration is working to make quick testing available at drive-in locations like the parking lots in front of Walgreens pharmacies or Target stores. The Verily website could help drive patients to those locations, officials said.Mr. Kushner declined to comment.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

"The coronavirus outbreak is inflicting new disruptions on the 2020 presidential campaign by the day, but few compare to the decisions by Louisiana and Georgia over the past 48 hours to reschedule their upcoming primary elections.The postponements were a highly unusual development in an American political campaign, though not an entirely unprecedented one.So how much disruption can voters expect in the coming months? And how freely can local, state and federal authorities switch up the timing and other details of elections? We took a crack at answering some of the questions that may be on your mind.Why are Louisiana and Georgia moving their primary elections?Louisiana’s secretary of state, R. Kyle Ardoin, a Republican, asked Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, to postpone the state’s April 4 primary by about two months because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.

Kyle Ardoin, a Republican, asked Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, to postpone the state’s April 4 primary by about two months because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. The two men are permitted to do so by a Louisiana law that allows the governor to reschedule an election because of an emergency, so long as the secretary of state has certified that an emergency exists.Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, announced Saturday that he was postponing the March 24 primary until May, and the Democratic Party of Georgia said it had endorsed the decision.

Have other states changed their primaries in response to the coronavirus?No. Or at least, not yet.The four states with elections coming up on Tuesday — Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois — have taken other precautions to make voting safer without shifting the date of their primaries. It is possible, however, that some later-voting states could follow the example of Louisiana and Georgia.While such last-minute changes are highly unusual, states have broad autonomy to define the timing and procedures for primary elections. The exact process for setting primary dates varies from state to state. That is why a number of states changed the dates of their primaries and caucuses between 2016 and 2020, and why Republicans in several states were able to cancel their 2020 primary elections to minimize intraparty competition for President Trump.

But the Democratic Party also has its own rules requiring that all primary elections be completed by June 9, and that all delegates to its national convention in Milwaukee be selected by June 20. Any states that defy that timetable — including Louisiana — could be penalized by the national party with a reduction in their delegate count.Could the general election be postponed or canceled?Only with enormous difficulty.The date of the general election is set by federal law and has been fixed since 1845. It would take a change in federal law to move that date. That would mean legislation enacted by Congress, signed by the president and subject to challenge in the courts.To call that unlikely would be an understatement.And even if all of that happened, there would not be much flexibility in choosing an alternate election date: The Constitution mandates that the new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s term must begin on Jan. 20. Those dates cannot be changed just by the passage of normal legislation.After Louisiana’s announcement on Friday, Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer, knocked down what he described as a wave of queries about whether the November election could be similarly revised.“I am getting a lot of questions about the November election,” Mr. Elias wrote on Twitter. “While states can set their own primary days, the federal general election is set by federal statute as the the [sic] Tuesday following the first Monday in November.

What about the procedures for voting in the November election?While the date of the presidential election is set by federal law, the procedures for voting are generally controlled at the state level.That’s why we have such a complicated patchwork of voting regulations, with some states allowing early and absentee voting; some permitting voting by mail or same-day voter registration; others requiring certain kinds of identification for voters; and many states doing few or none of those things.So it is possible that states could revise their voting procedures in response to a public health crisis, perhaps by making it easier to vote by mail or through various absentee procedures that would not require people to cluster together on one particular date.Washington State, a focal point for the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, has conducted elections by mail for years, and its presidential primary on March 10 was able to unfold without disruption.The federal government could also take steps to mandate or encourage different voting procedures, without changing the timing of the election. Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, has proposed that Congress require states to offer “no excuse absentee balloting” for the general election, so that anyone can opt to vote by a method besides in-person voting on Election Day.

"PHOENIX — Colin Jordan, a 32-year-old software salesman, lists various predictable reasons for his move to Scottsdale from the San Francisco Bay Area. He likes sun and golf and lower income taxes. But beneath all that is something bigger, which is the feeling that Arizona has welcomed him in ways that California — where he grew up — did not.There are certain expectations you come into after graduating from college and getting a $90,000-a-year job, and one is that you won’t be paying $1,800 a month for a bedroom in a backyard cottage, which was what Mr. Jordan was doing in the Bay Area. He liked living near his childhood home and working at a tech company in the nation’s capital of innovation. But not if there was no path to what he considered a middle-class life.“I knew for sure I’m never going to own a home,” he said. “So I talked to my girlfriend, and that was our defining moment. I said: ‘I want to buy a house and start a life.

They are also part of a changing political identity that has given the once-solidly conservative state, now home to more than seven million people, a more purple-hued electorate.

But it is clear how far it has come.A decade ago, the state was grappling with foreclosures, bank failures and scores of empty subdivisions. Its unemployment rate peaked at 10.9 percent, about a percentage point higher than the nation’s. Today jobs have recovered, and the state is back to building seemingly every kind of development, from high-rise apartments and condominiums in the urban core to golf-course-adjacent ranch homes in the exurbs.

From 2012 to 2018, an average of about 250,000 people per year migrated to Arizona from other states, with the largest contribution coming from California, according to an analysis of census data by Susan Weber for the demographic research site SocialExplorer.com. This is why it costs around $1,000 to rent a U-Haul truck heading from Orange County, Calif., to Phoenix, but only $100 to rent one to go the other way, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.On the surface, adding new people and new subdivisions is the same thing the Arizona economy was doing as the real estate bubble inflated. But the nature of Arizona’s growth — and the kinds of workers it has attracted — has changed.In the previous cycle, the economy consisted of “building homes for people who build homes,” said Scott Smith, a former homebuilder who served as the mayor of Mesa and is now chief executive of Valley Metro, the Phoenix region’s public transportation authority. The recent expansion, on the other hand, is marked by the growth of finance and technology companies that employ people like Mr. Jordan.The number of finance jobs in the Phoenix area is up 25 percent since its pre-recession peak in early 2007, compared with 5 percent nationally, with companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan opening or expanding local offices, according to Moody’s Analytics. Technology companies have expanded their head count by about 30 percent in that time, while construction employment is still 24 percent lower than its peak before the recession.“Our economy has been diversified like I have never seen in my three decades in business,” said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage firm in Scottsdale.If construction and subprime loans were symbolic of the state’s last boom, this time the image would be offices like WebPT, which makes software used by physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists to manage billing and medical information. Over the past decade the company has grown from a handful of people working out of subleased office space in coffee shops and architectural firms to a 500-person operation with headquarters in a downtown Phoenix industrial space that used to be a tortilla factory.

Inside there are the typical tech office touches like standing desks, Nerf guns, a commitment to dog-friendliness and conference rooms named after booze (margarita, gimlet, old fashioned, mojito). Heidi Jannenga, a co-founder of the company and its chief clinical officer, has a skateboard in her office and a nameplate that exhorts others to Do Epic Stuff, only it doesn’t say “stuff.”“The ecosystem was nonexistent when we started,” she said of the environment for tech companies. “But we now we’re starting to have the density, which is really exciting.”Despite its impressive job figures, Phoenix’s growth comes with a wrinkle, which is that the new tech and finance jobs are concentrated in positions that tend to pay less than is typical for these industries, noted Marc Korobkin, an economist with Moody’s Analytics. The average finance job in Phoenix pays about $77,000 a year, compared with about $110,000 nationally, according to Moody’s. The typical tech job pays $80,000 to $85,000, compared with $110,000 to $115,000 nationally.Yelp, the business-directory and user-review site, is based in San Francisco but has moved hundreds of lower-paid sales and customer-service jobs to the Phoenix area. The company’s California and Arizona offices look similar — cramped cubicles, free candy — but where the San Francisco headquarters have an engineering-heavy work force and the cerebral quiet of headphone-equipped employees staring intently at computer screens, the 1,200-person Scottsdale operation reverberates with the din of sales representatives on phone calls while channeling their stress and ambition into imaginary baseball and golf swings.The luxury of feeling relatively affluent is what Phoenix is selling to people as well as companies. A typical home in the Phoenix area is valued at about $293,000, below the national median of $306,000, according to Redfin, a national real estate brokerage. In addition to lots of flat and open land, a light regulatory environment makes it easier to build enough homes to meet demand. In the fourth quarter of 2019, builders in Phoenix were on a pace to build three times as many units — 14.6 per 10,000 residents — as the Los Angeles region, according to the Census Bureau.

The state has so much new housing, in so many different places, that it defies a particular type. In downtown Phoenix and in Tempe, home of Arizona State University, there are skyscrapers over light rail and a taste of the urbanist dream. About a mile from Arizona State along the light-rail tracks, Culdesac, a developer based in the Bay Area, is building a car-free development in a region known for sprawl.

About a mile from Arizona State along the light-rail tracks, Culdesac, a developer based in the Bay Area, is building a car-free development in a region known for sprawl. At the same time, if you drive 40 miles west to an 8,800-acre planned community called Verrado, you see a more stereotypically Phoenix development. Verrado, which sits amid a rocky, shrub-covered landscape that is being steadily consumed by homes in various shades of tan, is in the town of Buckeye. Buckeye had about 7,000 people in 2000. Now it has 75,000 — along with new schools, new Starbucks cafes, new Taco Bells and homes in every stage of completion.Unlike the dense living in Tempe, Verrado marks a revival of the exurbs that were hit hardest by the recession. The project’s developer started listing homes in 2004, and sold just over 500 that year. Then the housing boom collapsed, and it sold 87 in its worst year. But Verrado has steadily recovered, and in 2019 had its best year yet, with 602 homes sold.While downtown-style living tends to attract young people with no children and old people with grown children, Verrado is a place for people in the thick of rearing children, people who think that “as much fun as it was to walk to get a beer, life has changed, and I want a backyard,” said Dan Kelly, the general manager.

With a growth rate second only to Nevada’s, Arizona is expanding its political clout and poised to become more Democratic. Newcomers arriving for cheaper housing and tech jobs are not the only cause of the shift but emblematic of it, said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.The most recent example of the change is Kyrsten Sinema, the first Arizona Democrat elected to the Senate in 30 years, who won by 2.4 percentage points in 2018.

"In the United States, the chance that a child attends a high-quality preschool — which research has shown sets them on a more successful life path — often depends on whether the parents can afford it. But what if government-funded care and education of children started soon after birth?There’s a growing movement to do so, particularly among Democrats. But they differ on how far they want to go. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders pushed universal birth-to-kindergarten plans during the race for the Democratic nomination. Joe Biden has said he would work with states to provide pre-K at age 3, but he has not offered details, and has not proposed universal child care. Mr. Sanders, who says his plan would help fight family poverty, suggested that he would challenge Mr. Biden on the issue in the debate on Sunday.The Sanders and Warren proposals — she introduced a bill last June — would raise taxes on the very wealthy, then give the money to existing and new child care providers, via state or local agencies, as long as they met quality and teacher compensation standards. Every child would be guaranteed a spot.“We have ideas now that we talk about that we just weren’t talking about even a year ago, a two-cent wealth tax and universal child care, that could be real,” Senator Warren recently told reporters.

It hasn’t always been the norm in parts of the United States that public school started at age 5. The first kindergartens, in the late 1800s, started at age 3. Several states and cities already offer universal pre-K, starting at age 3 or 4, including Oklahoma, New York City and Washington, D.C. In Washington, the vast majority of children attend preschool, and 86 percent of them finish ready for kindergarten, as measured by their cognition skills.But over all, Americans have resisted universal care and education for the youngest children. One reason has been political resistance to a large new taxpayer-financed government program. Another has been the belief held by some that young children should be home with a parent, and that it’s not the government’s role to intervene during this period.Yet three major things have changed. A significant amount of research has shown that high-quality care and education are important for young children’s development, and that low-income children have significantly less access to these programs. Second, most parents work, including 65 percent of mothers of children under 6 — and women’s work force participation increases when there is public preschool. Finally, the private market for child care isn’t working well: Families are struggling to afford rising child care costs, yet teachers are underpaid.“From age 0 to age 5 we say, ‘Parents, you’re on your own,’ and then at age 5, we start child care and education, even though we know from child development how much happens from birth to age 5,” said Elliot Haspel, author of “Crawling Behind: America’s Child Care Crisis and How to Fix It” and an education policy researcher at the Robins Foundation.The public school analogy goes only so far. Under the Democrats’ proposals, governments would not run preschools, as they do public schools, and attendance would not be mandatory. Also, the curriculum would not be academic, but tailored to the needs of early childhood, when learning happens through play.

Also, the curriculum would not be academic, but tailored to the needs of early childhood, when learning happens through play. But researchers and proponents say that thinking about early childhood programs like public school is a useful frame. As schools close because of the coronavirus outbreak, parents are coming to terms with how much they rely on them as a safe place for children to go. The idea treats preschool as an investment that benefits society at large, as primary and secondary education do. Universal programs tend to have broader political support than those that are means-tested — targeted at people below a certain income. And they are simpler to run because people don’t have to submit paperwork to prove they qualify.For early learning in particular, researchers say, universal options have educational benefits that means-tested programs like Head Start do not. Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool. Those who don’t are more likely to be Hispanic, from low-income families or with parents who did not go to college.

Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool. Those who don’t are more likely to be Hispanic, from low-income families or with parents who did not go to college. In countries where early childhood programs are offered to everyone, it has become the default option, said Gabriele Fain, director of the early childhood practice at the American Institutes for Research. (These countries also tend to have very long parental leaves, so many children do not need outside care until they are toddlers.)“It’s just inherent in how they think about early childhood education,” she said. “It’s really baked into these countries in a much more cultural way than it is here in the United States, with our pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality.”France and the Nordic countries spend 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent of gross domestic product on early childhood care and education. The United States spends 0.4 percent. In much of Europe, it is considered a child’s legal right, no matter the family’s income or background, which helps protect government funding for it, according to a report co-written by Ms. Fain.Republicans have not generally supported universal care, and neither has The Trump administration. It has made child care an issue, though, releasing a set of policy ideas in December, and there is some overlap with Democratic proposals — both support funding more home-based providers, for instance.Some say any public child care program should also subsidize parents who stay home with their children: “People’s values and needs are extremely diverse,” said Samuel Hammond, director of poverty and welfare policy at the Niskanen Center. “I would say: Just give the parents the money.”The biggest difference between the Sanders and Warren plans is that his proposes free child care and preschool for everyone. Her bill would make it free for poor families and up to 7 percent of income for others.There is no indication that any of the Democrats’ plans, as of now, are politically viable. But proponents point to real-world evidence, on a much smaller scale: the cities and states with universal pre-K, where it’s not only been possible, but popular.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said on Saturday, a week after having contact with multiple people who days later tested positive for the virus.“This evening, I received confirmation that the test is negative,” the physician, Sean P. Conley, said in a statement. “The president remains symptom free.”The announcement capped a week of uncertainty about the status of Mr. Trump’s health, as he decided not to quarantine himself and shook hands with chief executives who visited the White House and held meetings with administration officials working in the West Wing.And it was greeted with immediate skepticism from Mr. Trump’s critics, serving as the latest reminder of how the president is squandering the credibility he needs in a moment of national emergency — especially when it comes to his health.

Mr. Trump revealed earlier in the day that he had been tested and was awaiting results, a little more than 12 hours after the White House physician said that because the president had no symptoms, a test was not necessary.The result was released hours after Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said she was quarantining at home and awaiting results after experiencing flulike symptoms. Ms. McDaniel had attended a fund-raising event last Friday night at Mar-a-Lago, where she introduced Mr. Trump.On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s almost casual admission at a White House news conference of his decision to get tested — not because of his interactions with Brazilian officials who later tested positive for the virus, but because of news media coverage — raised more questions than it answered.Mr. Conley issued a letter at 11:55 p.m. on Friday acknowledging that while the president interacted with at least two people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, he was not recommending home quarantine, and “testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.’’It was unclear if Mr. Trump took the test after the letter was released, or if Dr. Conley’s letter was a falsehood, or if the physician was misleading in his formulation that a test for the president was “not currently indicated” — which did not say directly whether Mr. Trump had been tested.

In his follow-up statement on Saturday, Dr. Conley said that on Friday night, “after an in-depth discussion with the president regarding Covid-19 testing, he elected to proceed.”“I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday,” Mr. Trump said on Saturday. At his news conference in the Rose Garden a day earlier, the president was pressed repeatedly about whether he would be tested after interacting with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after the two men met in Florida. “People were asking, did I take the test,” he said.A clip of Mr. Trump being pressed on the matter played repeatedly on cable news, and appeared to influence his decision to take one.Mr. Trump left the briefing room before reporters could ask follow-up questions, but the president said that he had taken his temperature and described it as “totally normal.”Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Trump took the test before or after the release of Dr. Conley’s letter, or why Mr. Trump would have taken a test in spite of the advice of his doctor.On Friday, Mr. Trump’s advice to Americans watching his news conference was that “they shouldn’t be jumping to get the test unless it’s necessary,” adding that “but I think they have to listen to their doctors.”A senior administration official said only that while testing was not necessary, Mr. Trump “requested the test, and it was his decision to make his personal medical test public.” In his follow-up statement on Saturday, Dr. Conley said that on Friday night, “after an in-depth discussion with the president regarding Covid-19 testing, he elected to proceed.”“I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday,” Mr. Trump said on Saturday.

Vice President Mike Pence, a senior administration official said, learned only on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had been tested. At the news conference, Mr. Pence was left to handle questions about the president’s decision, some of which he did not appear to know how to answer.Mr. Pence also indicated that he might soon follow the president’s lead. “I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician’s office,” he told reporters. The physician, he said, had previously advised him that he did not need testing.Mr. Trump, who sees strength as the most important quality someone can project, has often equated illness with weakness. Over the past week, he had resisted testing, disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has recommended tests and self-quarantine for anyone who has stood next to someone who had tested positive.Despite having the imprimatur of the highest level of American government, Dr. Conley’s decision not to recommend a test for Mr. Trump, or any sort of isolation, was at odds with the advice of other physicians, as well as medical experts on the administration’s own coronavirus task force.The standard protocol is to ask people exposed to a known coronavirus case to stay home, to monitor their own health and to refrain from their regular activities for 14 days, and to get tested if they develop symptoms, said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.As a head of state leading the nation through a turbulent time, the president has a singular responsibility to safeguard his health, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. By letting a week go by before agreeing to a test, Mr. Gostin said, Mr. Trump “gives exactly the wrong message to the public, and puts himself and his cabinet at risk.”But that decision was in line with the course of action Mr. Trump preferred — avoiding a test whose results could make him face a reality he might not want to acknowledge. It also followed a pattern of Mr. Trump’s career in politics: releasing memos and statements from medical professionals who are willing to say whatever he wants them to say about his health. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, Mr. Trump’s personal physician during the 2016 presidential campaign, later admitted that a flattering doctor’s letter he had released was dictated to him verbatim by Mr. Trump.

Yet some of his supporters remain firm that the president’s opponents are using the outbreak for their gain.On Tuesday, a day before the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus a global pandemic, Mark Hammond, a Republican from La Plata, Md., logged into Facebook and marked himself “safe from whatever it is the media wants me to be afraid of today.”“It’s a scare tactic,” he said, of media coverage of the crisis. “Altogether it’s part of a Democratic long game.”Mr. Hammond, who has a home remodeling company and runs a Facebook group called “Patriots Against Impeachment,” said he attended this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., where an attendee tested positive for the virus. When asked if he was worried about becoming infected or about the pandemic generally, Mr. Hammond was clear: “110 percent, no.”“I have not changed one thing in my daily life,” he said, adding that for the past decade he has kept a “ready bag” and six months’ worth of supplies on hand, just in case an emergency arises.For many Trump supporters, this moment is unsettling — though not linked, in their mind, to the president himself.Jeff Schumacher, a 42-year-old realtor, lives in suburban Seattle, so far one of the areas in the nation hardest hit by the virus. He is juggling his work and his three children being at home after schools closed, and is watching supplies dwindle in stores near his home in Everett.

"WASHINGTON — The House passed an emergency relief package Saturday to address the sweeping effects of the coronavirus and cushion the economic blow to the most vulnerable Americans.The legislation includes a series of measures intended to bolster the safety net for families and workers whose livelihoods and health are affected by the virus. With President Trump weighing in late to voice his approval, the Senate is expected to take up the package and could pass it as early as next week.It is unclear how much the package will cost, because the Congressional Budget Office, the independent federal agency that assesses the revenue effects of legislation, did not have time to calculate a price tag.Here’s what’s in the package.There is paid sick leave for workers — but millions aren’t covered.The measure gives some workers two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave, equal to no less than two-thirds of their pay. The provision is aimed at encouraging people to follow the advice of public health officials who have said the best way to contain the spread of the virus is to have anyone experiencing symptoms stay at home.

The provision is aimed at encouraging people to follow the advice of public health officials who have said the best way to contain the spread of the virus is to have anyone experiencing symptoms stay at home. But those benefits only apply to employees of businesses with fewer than 500 employees, or the government, who are infected by the virus, quarantined, have a sick family member or are affected by school closings. Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50 employees, if it determines that providing paid leave “would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.”Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus. Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some public health experts have called for — effectively paying any worker to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.It also excludes “certain health care providers and emergency responders” from the benefit.Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave. The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the outbreak.The paid leave provisions were among the most contentious elements of the legislation. Republicans objected to a proposal by Democrats to establish a permanent paid sick leave entitlement for all families, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private negotiations.

There is also $100 million to provide nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands and $250 million to provide additional home-delivered and prepackaged meals to low-income seniors who rely on federal programs.

"WASHINGTON — It started as a series of conversations this past week between officials working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and the chief executive of Verily, a life sciences subsidiary of Google’s parent company, about how it might help the Trump administration in the fight against the coronavirus.Verily was developing a website that could let people evaluate their symptoms and direct them to nearby “drive through” locations for testing. Desperate to tap the private sector to satisfy the public’s demands for a more robust response to the rapidly spreading virus, Mr. Kushner was quickly sold on the idea.But on Friday, President Trump inflated the concept far beyond reality. At a news conference in the Rose Garden, he said that the company was helping to develop a website that would sharply expand testing for the virus, falsely claiming that “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now” and adding that “they’ve made tremendous progress.”In truth, the project at Verily — which has a total of about 1,000 employees — is in its infancy. A pilot program is planned for the San Francisco area, but a website has yet to be unveiled.

A pilot program is planned for the San Francisco area, but a website has yet to be unveiled. Testing locations have not been identified, and the coronavirus tests themselves are not yet widely available. The president’s effort to sell the website as a significant response to an urgent public health crisis came amid a national outcry over the administration’s repeated failures to deliver on promises to quickly expand access to testing for the virus. The disconnect between Mr. Trump’s exuberant comments and the project’s more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about his administration’s response to the virus, even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress.In the hours after the president’s remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely “in the early stages of development.” The 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.Now, with Google executives eager to show they are working with the president, the company is racing to meet the promise even as they acknowledge that the debut of the website will be far more limited than Mr. Trump has suggested. A person familiar with the project said Verily was planning to start on Monday with a website that could direct people in the San Francisco Bay Area to as many as three virus testing locations.Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Saturday that “the objective here is to have a website up very quickly,” and promised that more details about the partnership with Google would be revealed on Sunday. He said the website would initially be used “in the areas that have been deeply impacted — Washington State, California, New York.”Mr. Trump has repeatedly made statements about efforts to combat the virus that are wrong. Even as testing was severely limited, he said that “anyone who wants a test can get one.” He suggested the country was “very close to a vaccine,” despite evidence from health experts that one is probably at least a year away. And he stated he “closed” travel from Europe even though Americans and legal residents are exempted.

And he stated he “closed” travel from Europe even though Americans and legal residents are exempted.  This account of the president’s embrace of a Google-backed website as a tool for fighting the virus is based on interviews with administration officials and Google employees familiar with the project, and the communications between the company and the White House.In the past 10 days, Mr. Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to the president, has taken an increasingly central role in Mr. Trump’s response to the virus. He helped draft the president’s prime-time address this week from the Oval Office, which drew widespread criticism for its repeated errors and misleading statements. He has also reached out to Dr. Kurt Kloss, a physician based in New York, for advice. Dr. Kloss is the father of Karlie Kloss, who is married to Joshua Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s brother.Administration officials said people close to Mr. Kushner had been in touch with Andy Conrad, the chief executive at Verily, earlier in the week about whether the subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, could somehow help with testing. Mr. Conrad, who is known within Alphabet as an executive with an independent streak, described the yet unnamed website to them.Mr. Kushner, who has led the government’s outreach to the technology community, liked the idea, according to one administration official. He directed his team to work with Mr. Conrad and others at Verily on how their original project might be adapted to help fight the virus.At that point, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, was not involved in the discussions, according to people familiar with the situation. Mr. Pichai contacted Mr. Conrad on Wednesday, after an employee asked a question during one of the company’s all-staff meetings about whether Verily could help with testing.In a memo to his staff the next day, Mr. Pichai wrote that “a planning effort” was underway at Verily to use its expertise in clinical research to aid in the testing.“As more test kits become available, the planners are looking to develop a pathway for public health and health care agencies,” Mr. Pichai wrote, adding that the effort was targeted at making sure that “individuals who are at higher risk can be directed to testing sites based on the latest guidance from public health authorities.” This account of the president’s embrace of a Google-backed website as a tool for fighting the virus is based on interviews with administration officials and Google employees familiar with the project, and the communications between the company and the White House.In the past 10 days, Mr. Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to the president, has taken an increasingly central role in Mr. Trump’s response to the virus.

He attached a link to a form where Google employees could volunteer to help. Over the next day, more than 1,700 signed up, a number that was communicated to Mr. Kushner’s team.On Friday, reeling from the collapse of the stock markets and warnings by health experts of the virus’s rapid spread, Mr. Trump scheduled an afternoon news conference.In the hours before the president’s appearance, Mr. Kushner’s team prepared a poster showing how the website might work; it did not mention Google specifically, but a flow chart showed that a “screening website” could provide “new options for consumers” around the country as they seek to find out whether they are infected.During the news conference, Mr. Trump was enthusiastic.“I want to thank Google — Google is helping to develop a website,” he said. “It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”Moments later, at Mr. Trump’s invitation, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who is coordinating the response to the virus, held up Mr. Kushner’s poster, saying that it represented a “new approach to testing, which will start in the screening website up here, facilitated by Google.”The initial reaction 3,000 miles away in Silicon Valley was swift.Mr. Trump’s comments caught Google completely off guard and executives rushed to issue a statement on Friday afternoon to temper expectations, making it clear that the website is an effort led by Verily, not Google itself.

Since then, Google executives have scrambled to coordinate with the White House in an effort to do as much as possible to make the president’s vision for the website a reality. On Saturday, Google placed a link on its home page — a rare use of its digital canvass — to encourage people to take steps to prevent spreading the virus.In addition, Google said it was working on a separate “national informational website” to provide information on virus symptoms and testing sites.In a statement, company executives wrote that they are “aligned with the U.S. government to work to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus and to protect the health of our communities.” Administration officials on Saturday sought to play down expectations, saying that the website could provide significant help in the fight against the virus if it operated only in the nine biggest hot spots around the country. One official noted that Mr. Trump never said that the website would operate in every community nationwide.The administration is working to make quick testing available at drive-in locations like the parking lots in front of Walgreens pharmacies or Target stores.

Sunday night’s debate offers the chance for both men to take the cases they have been making in recent days onto the national stage after the epidemic forced them to pull back from large-scale campaign events.Mr. Sanders, who has issued recommendations — including for the government to offer treatment free of charge and expand anti-hunger initiatives aimed at the poor — has also used the outbreak to push anew for “Medicare for all,” his signature single-payer health care proposal.Mr. Biden has unfurled a plan of his own, as well as a “Public Health Advisory Committee” featuring prominent health care leaders, seeking at every turn to “offer a view into how Biden will lead in times of crisis as president,” as one Biden official described a Thursday speech Mr. Biden delivered on the matter.

Depending on how the night goes, the confrontation could be either a swan song for Mr. Sanders, who has suffered a string of crushing primary defeats this month, or a chance for the onetime front-runner to reassert his rationale for extending the contest.

Mr. Sanders, speaking after last week’s losses in Michigan and three other states, telegraphed his intention to press Mr. Biden hard on health care, climate change and income inequality, and reiterated that intention in an online chat with supporters on Saturday, vowing to “demand” Biden address questions about “the power structure in America.” Yet the actions of both men in the aftermath of Tuesday’s primaries — Mr. Biden set out a welcome mat for his rival rather than pressuring him to quit, and Mr. Sanders outlined tough terms for an eventual détente — also shed light on a personal relationship that has remained sturdy, amicable and functional, a far cry from the acrimony that defined Mr. Sanders’s relationship with Mrs. Clinton after their bitter duel four years ago.This no-frills personal connection, aides to both men say, could become an important factor in quickly uniting the party to confront President Trump, despite the wide policy gulf between the moderate Mr. Biden and the progressive Mr. Sanders.“I think both men know where this is likely going, and they both know how to approach one another,” said David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Barack Obama who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the White House. “Sanders, it seems to me, is a guy who wants to land the plane, and is asking Biden to show him some lights from the ground.

Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005).But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.” Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden’s ascent to the vice presidency in 2009.

Mr. Sanders has expressed his sympathy to the former vice president directly during joint appearances and to his own staff, people close to both men said.He has also pushed back on the perception, leveled by many former opponents, that he has tacitly encouraged supporters to scorch them by proxy. In January, he sought to distance himself from Zephyr Teachout, an ally from New York, who published an op-ed during the impeachment proceedings that accused Mr. Biden of contributing to a “transactional, grossly corrupt” political culture at a time when Trump supporters were hitting Mr. Biden for failing to stop Hunter Biden from joining the board of an energy company in Ukraine.“It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way,” Mr. Sanders said, and then offered a fuller apology to Mr. Biden directly when the two marched in a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration in South Carolina, according to a Biden aide.“Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie,” Mr. Biden replied on Twitter. “Let’s all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.” Privately, he has vented his disgust over Mr. Trump’s attempts to make a campaign issue of the business activities of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter.

He is also known to have a hair-trigger temper — which was on four-letter display last week when a construction worker in Michigan accused him of trying to confiscate his guns.And while Mr. Sanders is widely expected to be the aggressor at the debate, it is just as likely that Mr. Biden, who is feeling confident, will be the candidate who raises his voice the loudest on Sunday night, according to people who have worked with him over the years.“Bernie, I think, knows that he has to strike a balance,” added Mr. Axelrod, who helped prepare Mr. Biden for his high-stakes vice-presidential debate with Paul D.

"WASHINGTON — The Department of Veterans Affairs, legally designated as the backup health care system in national emergencies, is preparing to absorb the overflow of coronavirus patients from private hospitals if — or when — they become strained to the breaking point. It would be the biggest test the sprawling and sometimes troubled government hospital system has faced.The department is experienced in managing an older and vulnerable population, and in many ways, it could be better prepared than the rest of the health care system to take on the task. It has a surplus of beds in many of its 172 hospital centers and a robust number of special rooms for patients with breathing disorders. Leaders at the agency say they have a surplus of supplies that they have been ordering since the beginning of the year.“Nobody has asked for our help at this point, but the American people should know we are ready,” said Dr. Richard A. Stone, who is in charge of the Veterans Health Administration.But several current and former officials said they feared that in this case, the department would be hampered by its highly centralized and often opaque management culture, which has left some critical players unsure of how the department is preparing and what is expected of its tens of thousands of employees.

In 1982, Congress added what is known as a fourth mission to the department — which otherwise focuses on patient care, training and research — to back up the nation’s entire health care system.The private-sector health care system has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people and an estimated 45,000 intensive care unit beds, and it could be overwhelmed with an explosion in the number of new, acutely ill patients.The department has, in theory, the capacity to fill its mission. In addition to its central medical facilities, it has 1,074 outpatient sites and more than 330,000 full-time employees across the country. The veterans’ system has 13,000 acute care beds, including 1,800 intensive care beds, and has far more equipment and specialized care facilities — such as negative pressure rooms meant to isolate those with an infection like the coronavirus — than many private hospital systems.It has played a significant and often vital role in recent years, backing up the strained health care system in Puerto Rico after a hurricane — it had intravenous therapy solutions that other centers did not — and providing mobile units after the 2016 mass shooting in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. The department is one of the many federal coordinating centers that respond to emergencies; it even played a role in the Ebola outbreak.Its problem, though, may be management.When the department decided last week to bar visitors from its nursing homes to protect against a coronavirus outbreak, some were unprepared. The police force of the department, strained by its diminished numbers, is concerned about how to manage situations like a recent visitor to a veterans’ hospital who had to be physically removed under protest after an initial screening showed he was possibly infected with the coronavirus.

Some workers said they were not clear if veterans would be prioritized over civilians in an emergency at their medical centers, and there were mixed messages in the department as to whether it would be called on at all.“There is not a unified plan of action,” said Bob Fetzer, the president of the Fourth District of the American Federal of Government Employees National Veterans Affairs Council, which represents thousands of workers from the department. He said he had received complaints from members who said they were not receiving communications from Washington.Robert L. Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, was added belatedly to the White House coronavirus task force this month and is rarely visible, other participants said.He was not among the many officials and corporate executives who spoke on Friday at a news conference with President Trump in the Rose Garden. The department was not even mentioned at that event. Several current and former employees at the veterans department and Capitol Hill staff members said they hoped Mr. Wilkie, who does not have a background in public health, would not be sidelined.A senior administration official familiar with the task force’s meetings said that Mr. Wilkie’s role in the group, thus far at least, had mostly included offering reassurances that the veterans’ medical system was ready to help. “To my knowledge he was been at all the meetings,” Dr. Stone said.Lawmakers in both parties, who have long complained about opacity at the department, are carefully watching.“We recognize that the Covid-19 outbreak is an evolving situation, with a growing impact on the United States and global community, and want to ensure that the V.A. has all of the resources needed to keep veterans, staff and communities safe,” Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said in a statement, referring to the disease caused by the virus.

A group of senators has requested information on the agency’s efforts to increase its response time and preparedness as cases are expected to climb among veterans, who tend to be older and have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk.Dr. Stone has been the department’s lead official speaking to Capitol Hill, the White House and the news media. Congressional staff members receive daily updates on the number and location of veterans who test positive — 16 as of Friday — and have begun weekly conference calls with Dr. Stone.The department’s medical centers are far-flung and operate largely independently. They vary greatly in capacity and quality. During a national emergency, local officials would have to explain their needs and abilities to Washington while seeking guidance. The questions would include: How do they prioritize care between veterans and nonveterans? How should workers telecommute?Mr. Wilkie has in the past expressed concern that the department cannot keep proper track of its number of employees or their functions.Older veterans, who make up a large portion of the department’s patient base, as well as those with very difficult injuries and illnesses like spinal cord injuries and kidney failure, need special and acute care and sometimes rely on private contractors for things like dialysis. Those patients are likely to be the department’s focus if supplies dwindle in the American health care system.About 60 percent of the department’s medical staff have affiliations with other medical centers, and some workers worry about staff shortages in an extreme situation like those faced in China and Italy, although many of those doctors weight their time heavily toward the department’s facilities. During a hurricane in the Carolinas, medical staff worked overtime to personally move fragile spinal cord injury patients from the area to other states and bunked with department employees there.“The V.A. has some very talented people who work on emergency preparedness,” said David J. Shulkin, a former secretary of veterans affairs. “This is their time to shine.” A group of senators has requested information on the agency’s efforts to increase its response time and preparedness as cases are expected to climb among veterans, who tend to be older and have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk.Dr. Stone has been the department’s lead official speaking to Capitol Hill, the White House and the news media.

It can offer backup beds and care when private hospitals become overwhelmed. But a 50-bed center operating at only 30 percent capacity may not have the extra medical staff standing by to handle the influx, some officials cautioned. That may make the capacity less useful than it could be.Epidemiologists fear that medical professionals will also be infected by the virus, depleting their numbers.“I think we all need to recognize that in a heavy penetration of this virus, we are all going to be looking for providers,” Dr. Stone said. “But we are well staffed and well trained for what we need to do today.”Dr. Stone said the department had been ordering large quantities of supplies that could prove vital if those resources at other hospitals become depleted.“We are certainly not the first line of defense,” Dr. Stone said, but should the department be called on to assist with a civilian crisis, he was confident that it would step up.

Last week, over a dozen states began to shutter public schools, and colleges and universities worldwide announced class suspensions and plans to move to online instruction. In an interview with Brianna Keilar on CNN, Dr. Fauci said that progress was being made with companies like Walmart and CVS to improve diagnostic and testing capabilities.

Dana Ralph, the mayor of Kent, south of Seattle, said residents wondered whether their neighborhoods were being sacrificed to protect wealthier ones.The closing of schools in more than a dozen states continues to create concerns that children may miss meals and parents may not be able to stay home from work. After Los Angeles Unified School District said that it was closing, school officials said they would open 40 family resource centers to provide child care and meals to students whose parents cannot get out of work. North Carolina on Saturday became the latest state to close its public schools. And in some areas, officials were making provisions to house and isolate large numbers of people with the virus.

She posted a video on Twitter of travelers being asked to raise their hands if they had been in mainland Europe. Because of the delay, she also missed her connecting flight.“It truly felt like an apocalyptic scenario,” said Ms. Hardy, who left many of her belongings behind in England and was unsure whether she would be able to return.

As countries across Europe impose lockdowns and restrict travel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain is facing a swelling tide of opposition to his government’s more relaxed measures to stem the coronavirus. In an open letter, nearly 350 scientists and doctors called on him to immediately impose the kind of social distancing steps that countries like Italy, France and Spain have adopted.They warned that Britain’s approach — in which the government has talked of impending moves like quarantining older residents and closing schools but pushed off the timing for 10 days or longer — was putting lives at risk.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the British broadcaster Sky News that the action plan under consideration including asking Britons over 70 to self-isolate for up to four months to reduce their risk of contracting the virus. The government is also expected to ban large gatherings starting next week and to order people over age 70 to remain at home.The rate of infection in the country has been climbing as rapidly as elsewhere in Europe. Britain had at least 1,140 confirmed cases and 10 deaths as of Sunday, and the United States this weekend extended its ban on travelers from most of Europe to include those coming from Britain, as well.On Sunday, Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office also advised against “all but essential travel to the U.S.A., due to restrictions put in place by the U.S. government” on foreign nationals arriving from Britain and Ireland from Monday. The scientists’ letter, which was also signed by 33 experts outside Britain, including from Harvard, Cornell and the University of California, Berkeley, said: “We consider the social distancing measures taken as of today as insufficient, and we believe that additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately, as it is already happening in other countries across the world.” They sharply criticized the British government’s apparent embrace of the theory of “herd immunity,” under which the spread of the virus to a significant percentage of the population is viewed as acceptable, even beneficial, because it would build up immunity in the public and make Britain more resilient in the face of future outbreaks.The government’s chief scientific adviser laid out that theory in interviews last week, seemingly as a way to justify the country’s more relaxed approach to social distancing. But officials have since clarified that encouraging mass infections is not part of its strategy.

Manila, the densely populated capital of the Philippines, went under lockdown on Sunday as the government sought to assure citizens that the heavy presence of security forces did not herald a return to martial law.To stop the spread of the coronavirus, President Rodrigo Duterte’s government has banned public gatherings, suspended classes for a month, imposed a limited curfew and restricted travel in and out of the Manila metropolitan area. Soldiers and police officers set up checkpoints on Sunday morning, stopping vehicles and checking the temperatures of people inside. Manila, the densely populated capital of the Philippines, went under lockdown on Sunday as the government sought to assure citizens that the heavy presence of security forces did not herald a return to martial law.To stop the spread of the coronavirus, President Rodrigo Duterte’s government has banned public gatherings, suspended classes for a month, imposed a limited curfew and restricted travel in and out of the Manila metropolitan area. Soldiers and police officers set up checkpoints on Sunday morning, stopping vehicles and checking the temperatures of people inside. Mr. Duterte announced the measures on Thursday, emphasizing that they were to protect the public and that there would be no return to military rule. Many Filipinos have vivid memories of decades of martial law under President Ferdinand Marcos, who was driven out of power in 1986.“Do not be afraid of the soldiers — these are your soldiers,” Mr. Duterte said. “The armed forces is there to serve you and they are under orders from civilian authorities.”Mr. Duterte, an admirer of Mr. Marcos, placed the southern island of Mindanao under martial law for more than two years after an Islamist uprising there. During that time, he mused that it might become necessary to extend it to the whole country.Carol Araullo, head of a civic group, Bayan, said Mr. Duterte’s lockdown order “appears to focus mainly on limiting the movement of the people rather than addressing the more urgent health requirements and economic needs” of Manila residents. She said it included no provisions for a quarantine system or free testing for the capital’s many poor people, nor did it deploy “doctors, nurses and other health workers in the communities.”The Philippines has confirmed 111 coronavirus infections and eight deaths. A lawmaker said Sunday morning that an employee of the Philippine House of Representatives had died after testing positive for the virus.  “The whole House of Representatives is saddened,” the lawmaker, Rep. Jericho Nograles, said in a radio interview. “At the same time, we are also worried about the people he had contact with.”Beijing says new arrivals will have to quarantine, and cover their own costs.

China’s capital, Beijing, is toughening its rules for international arrivals, requiring everyone arriving from overseas to spend 14 days at a quarantine site beginning on Monday.All arrivals will have to pay for their own quarantine stay, officials said on Sunday. Beijing announced a mandatory quarantine last week, but allowed arrivals to complete the two-week isolation at home or in a hotel. The new rules will allow limited exceptions for home quarantine.Chinese officials have made a priority of controlling the spread of the virus in the capital. As of Saturday, the city had recorded 415 confirmed infections, including eight deaths and 353 people who have been treated.As it tightens restrictions on people entering the country, the Chinese government also is leading a sweeping campaign to purge the public sphere of dissent, censoring news reports, harassing citizen journalists and shutting down news sites.But Chinese journalists, buoyed by an outpouring of support from the public and widespread calls for free speech, are fighting back in a rare challenge to the ruling Communist Party.They are publishing hard-hitting exposés describing government cover-ups and failures in the health care system. They are circulating passionate calls for press freedom.

Beijing announced a mandatory quarantine last week, but allowed arrivals to complete the two-week isolation at home or in a hotel. The new rules will allow limited exceptions for home quarantine.Chinese officials have made a priority of controlling the spread of the virus in the capital. As of Saturday, the city had recorded 415 confirmed infections, including eight deaths and 353 people who have been treated.As it tightens restrictions on people entering the country, the Chinese government also is leading a sweeping campaign to purge the public sphere of dissent, censoring news reports, harassing citizen journalists and shutting down news sites.But Chinese journalists, buoyed by an outpouring of support from the public and widespread calls for free speech, are fighting back in a rare challenge to the ruling Communist Party.They are publishing hard-hitting exposés describing government cover-ups and failures in the health care system. They are circulating passionate calls for press freedom.

A 68-year-old Italian man who had been a passenger on the Costa Luminosa cruise ship died  of Covid-19 on Saturday in the Cayman Islands, the hospital and government there said.The ship left Fort Lauderdale, Fla., three weeks ago for a cruise in the Caribbean, returned and departed again on March 5. It  now has 1,427 passengers onboard. Two other Italian passengers tested positive for the illness in San Juan, Puerto Rico, after one fell ill  a week ago. The ship, which was turned away from Antigua and Spain, is scheduled to dock on Thursday in Marseille, France, where Italian passengers will be taken back to Italy, according to a statement on the company’s website.The man had two heart attacks onboard the vessel and was evacuated and admitted to a hospital on Feb. 29 in critical condition, according to a statement from the Health City Cayman Islands Hospital. He developed a dry cough six days later but had no other coronavirus symptoms. A test taken on Monday came back positive for the coronavirus three days later — and a day before the passengers who disembarked in San Juan were confirmed to have the virus. His death was caused by pneumonia, “with acute respiratory distress,” from the coronavirus disease, according to a doctor quoted in a news report.

Sunday night’s debate offers the chance for both men to take the cases they have been making in recent days onto the national stage after the epidemic forced them to pull back from large-scale campaign events.Mr. Sanders, who has issued recommendations — including for the government to offer treatment free of charge and expand anti-hunger initiatives aimed at the poor — has also used the outbreak to push anew for “Medicare for all,” his signature single-payer health care proposal.Mr. Biden has unfurled a plan of his own, as well as a “Public Health Advisory Committee” featuring prominent health care leaders, seeking at every turn to “offer a view into how Biden will lead in times of crisis as president,” as one Biden official described a Thursday speech Mr. Biden delivered on the matter.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate one on one for the first time on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders, who is staying in the Democratic primary race despite a series of defeats, has already telegraphed his strategy.“Joe, what are you going to do?” Mr. Sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week, ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press Mr. Biden on, including health care, student debt, climate change, mass incarceration, immigration and wealth inequality.Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.”Here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise.Heath careBidenOne of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that Mr. Biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like “Medicare for all.” Instead, he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a Medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for — a proposal that still goes well beyond the Affordable Care Act. He estimates his plan would cost $750 billion over a decade. Former Vice President Joseph R.

He estimates his plan would cost about $30 trillion over 10 years and would be paid for by new revenue of about $17.5 trillion, along with “current federal, state and local government spending.”He also wants to eliminate $81 billion in medical debt.CoronavirusBidenThe new coronavirus has quickly become the most urgent problem facing the country, and Mr. Biden released a plan on Thursday calling for free testing, “the elimination of all cost barriers to preventive care and treatment for Covid-19,” and emergency paid leave for affected workers.He also wants to restore a White House office that oversaw responses to global health crises — an office that the Obama administration created and the Trump administration eliminated — and direct the Justice Department to combat price gouging for medical supplies.

Climate changeBidenMr. Biden’s $1.7 trillion climate plan calls for 100 percent carbon-free energy and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It would end fossil fuel subsidies and subsidize clean energy, but envisions a continued role for fossil fuels for some time: It would not ban fracking, for instance. Mr. Biden also supports federal funding for carbon capture and sequestration programs that could, in theory, eventually offset some emissions.SandersMr. Sanders is a proponent of the Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution that calls for aggressive action to combat climate change, and has modeled his $16.3 trillion proposal on that plan. He calls for an immediate ban on fracking, for the electricity and transportation sectors to be carbon-free by 2030, and for the United States to end the use of fossil fuels no later than 2050.

ImmigrationBidenMr. Biden wants to undo the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies, reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, he would not decriminalize unauthorized border crossings, but he is calling for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and says he would deport only people who have committed a serious crime.SandersMr. Sanders has called for a moratorium on deportations pending a review of the current immigration system. He also supports the reinstatement and expansion of the DACA program, which protected from deportation people who were brought into the United States as children.In addition, he has backed the movement to abolish federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.Mass incarcerationBidenCriminal justice is a fraught issue for Mr. Biden, who helped pass laws, like the 1994 crime bill, that produced mass incarceration to begin with. He has made a stark reversal on the issue during this campaign, calling for incentives for states to shift from incarceration to crime prevention, an end to mandatory minimum sentences and the death penalty, and decriminalizing marijuana.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, however, he does not want to legalize marijuana.SandersMr. Sanders has promised to cut the national prison population in half and end mass incarceration. To do that, he wants to abolish the death penalty, three-strikes laws and mandatory minimum sentences, among other measures.Gun controlBidenMr. Biden supports an assault weapons ban, a voluntary buyback program and a ban on online gun sales, as well as a slew of proposals that are nearly universal among Democratic candidates now, like background checks and red-flag laws.

But much like criminal justice for Mr. Biden, gun control is a difficult area for Mr. Sanders, politically speaking: Earlier in his career, he voted against federal background checks and legal liability for gun manufacturers.AbortionBidenMr. Biden has a long and complicated record on abortion. In the 1980s, he supported an attempt to let states overturn Roe v. Wade, and he supported the Hyde Amendment — which prevents Medicaid from covering abortion in most circumstances — until just last year.Today, however, he supports the same basic set of policies every major Democrat in the race did, including legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, repeals of the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic “gag rules,” and a pledge to nominate only Supreme Court justices who support abortion rights.SandersMr. Sanders also supports legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, opposes the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic gag rules, and has promised to nominate only Supreme Court justices who would uphold Roe v.

He also wants to create tax credits for renters and first-time homeowners and expand the Section 8 housing voucher program.SandersMr. Sanders proposes spending $2.5 trillion to build about 10 million permanently affordable housing units. He also wants to implement a national rent control standard and spend $70 billion to repair public housing.Money in politicsBidenMr. Biden is calling for a constitutional amendment to make elections completely publicly funded, eliminating all private contributions — a significant step beyond what Mr. Sanders has proposed.

Biden Jr. held a cellphone to his lips and squinted into a camera inside an antiseptic room in one state (Delaware) bearing the flag from another (Illinois).

He nodded at his long-windedness (“I’ve already probably said too much”) and an uneven performance that, this time, was not his fault.“I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort,” Mr. Biden said, alluding to a series of tech failures during the session, “because of the connections.”The connections.They are complicated these days — for candidates, for voters, for socially-distanced Americans of all kinds. And as the presidential campaign moves uneasily through a new phase of non-contact and limited travel, the wider political world has already grown acutely aware of what it is losing.Politics happens in person, traditionally, and despite more recent feats of digital fund-raising and advertising, the smartphone era has been no exception. The selfies splashed across social media were taken in person. The stories that candidates tell about the good men and women of the state they just came from are generally contingent on meeting those good men and women in person. Even a well-cut commercial, mining footage of a contender firing up his charges, tends to rely on that firing-up happening in person.So, what now? What next? Who can be expected to tele-energize a coalition? Empathize viscerally by video conference? Move the masses consistent with best practices for virus transmission avoidance?

"In October 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders was whisked into Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s residence at the Naval Observatory for a breakfast of yogurt parfaits and caffeinated campaign advice from a vice president who had just announced his (temporary) retirement from presidential politics.The meeting, according to aides, lasted longer than expected, nearly two hours, with Mr. Biden discoursing on campaign strategy and a range of policy issues, and expressing admiration for a Sanders political operation that was waging an unexpectedly tough fight against Hillary Clinton.When Mr. Biden walked Mr. Sanders to his car, he clapped a hand on his shoulder and declared, “Good luck, buddy!” In October 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders was whisked into Joseph R.

Depending on how the night goes, the confrontation could be either a swan song for Mr. Sanders, who has suffered a string of crushing primary defeats this month, or a chance for the onetime front-runner to reassert his rationale for extending the contest. The two septuagenarians will meet again Sunday night under much different circumstances for the first, and possibly final, one-on-one Democratic primary debate of 2020, in a near-empty CNN studio in Washington selected to replace an Arizona venue because of the coronavirus crisis. Depending on how the night goes, the confrontation could be either a swan song for Mr. Sanders, who has suffered a string of crushing primary defeats this month, or a chance for the onetime front-runner to reassert his rationale for extending the contest. Mr. Sanders, speaking after last week’s losses in Michigan and three other states, telegraphed his intention to press Mr. Biden hard on health care, climate change and income inequality, and reiterated that intention in an online chat with supporters on Saturday, vowing to “demand” Biden address questions about “the power structure in America.” Yet the actions of both men in the aftermath of Tuesday’s primaries — Mr. Biden set out a welcome mat for his rival rather than pressuring him to quit, and Mr. Sanders outlined tough terms for an eventual détente — also shed light on a personal relationship that has remained sturdy, amicable and functional, a far cry from the acrimony that defined Mr. Sanders’s relationship with Mrs. Clinton after their bitter duel four years ago.This no-frills personal connection, aides to both men say, could become an important factor in quickly uniting the party to confront President Trump, despite the wide policy gulf between the moderate Mr. Biden and the progressive Mr. Sanders.“I think both men know where this is likely going, and they both know how to approach one another,” said David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Barack Obama who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the White House. “Sanders, it seems to me, is a guy who wants to land the plane, and is asking Biden to show him some lights from the ground. There’s nothing personal standing in the way of them getting together.” Mr. Sanders, speaking after last week’s losses in Michigan and three other states, telegraphed his intention to press Mr. Biden hard on health care, climate change and income inequality, and reiterated that intention in an online chat with supporters on Saturday, vowing to “demand” Biden address questions about “the power structure in America.” Yet the actions of both men in the aftermath of Tuesday’s primaries — Mr. Biden set out a welcome mat for his rival rather than pressuring him to quit, and Mr. Sanders outlined tough terms for an eventual détente — also shed light on a personal relationship that has remained sturdy, amicable and functional, a far cry from the acrimony that defined Mr. Sanders’s relationship with Mrs. Clinton after their bitter duel four years ago.This no-frills personal connection, aides to both men say, could become an important factor in quickly uniting the party to confront President Trump, despite the wide policy gulf between the moderate Mr. Biden and the progressive Mr. Sanders.“I think both men know where this is likely going, and they both know how to approach one another,” said David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Barack Obama who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the White House. “Sanders, it seems to me, is a guy who wants to land the plane, and is asking Biden to show him some lights from the ground. There’s nothing personal standing in the way of them getting together.” Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden’s ascent to the vice presidency in 2009. Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005.)But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.” Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden’s ascent to the vice presidency in 2009.

Mr. Sanders has expressed his sympathy to the former vice president directly during joint appearances and to his own staff, people close to both men said.He has also pushed back on the perception, leveled by many former opponents, that he has tacitly encouraged supporters to scorch them by proxy. In January, he sought to distance himself from Zephyr Teachout, an ally from New York, who published an op-ed during the impeachment proceedings that accused Mr. Biden of contributing to a “transactional, grossly corrupt” political culture at a time when Trump supporters were hitting Mr. Biden for failing to stop Hunter Biden from joining the board of an energy company in Ukraine.“It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way,” Mr. Sanders said, and then offered a fuller apology to Mr. Biden directly when the two marched in a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration in South Carolina, according to a Biden aide.“Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie,” Mr. Biden replied on Twitter. “Let’s all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.” Privately, he has vented his disgust over Mr. Trump’s attempts to make a campaign issue of the business activities of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter.

He is also known to have a hair-trigger temper — which was on four-letter display last week when a construction worker in Michigan accused him of trying to confiscate his guns.And while Mr. Sanders is widely expected to be the aggressor at the debate, it is just as likely that Mr. Biden, who is feeling confident, will be the candidate who raises his voice the loudest on Sunday night, according to people who have worked with him over the years.“Bernie, I think, knows that he has to strike a balance,” added Mr. Axelrod, who helped prepare Mr. Biden for his high-stakes vice-presidential debate with Paul D.

Schools are closing across the country. But in Arizona, many Democrats are hoping that voting in the presidential primary provides a slice of normalcy at a time that is anything but normal. “I want to believe that voting takes away some of the fear,” said Dawn Schumann, the political director for the Arizona Teamsters. “The fear is taking a lot out of all of us.”In dozens of interviews at polling places across the state this weekend, where early voting was underway, residents said voting felt like both an act of faith and defiance, even as other states were considering whether to move forward. “I want to believe that voting takes away some of the fear,” said Dawn Schumann, the political director for the Arizona Teamsters. “The fear is taking a lot out of all of us.”In dozens of interviews at polling places across the state this weekend, where early voting was underway, residents said voting felt like both an act of faith and defiance, even as other states were considering whether to move forward. By Monday, four states — Louisiana, Georgia, Ohio and Kentucky — had postponed their primary elections, with more likely to follow. But Arizona was still set to hold its election on Tuesday as planned. State and local officials said they would make disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer available at polling places, and they encouraged those who could to vote by mail.The 8,000 members of Ms. Schumann’s union, Teamsters Local 104, include airline workers and delivery workers, people who could be among the most at risk for contracting the coronavirus. But she said they were anticipating the primary.“They interact with a lot of people — they touch everything globally,” Ms. Schumann said. “I have no doubt many of them are eager to vote, maybe even more eager.”When Stephanie Ringler, 49, and David Devenport, 62, came to cast their ballots at the Burton Barr Public Library, near downtown Phoenix, on Friday afternoon, they had the future on their minds. But they vacillated between thinking of a time when the nation would go “back to normal” and wondering aloud, “What is normal now?”“We need an adult in the White House, first and foremost,” Ms. Ringler said. “We need a functioning cabinet who listens to common sense, who listens to science.” By Monday, four states — Louisiana, Georgia, Ohio and Kentucky — had postponed their primary elections, with more likely to follow.

As voters, they could practice social distancing even as they attempted to knit society back together.“We don’t have enough people out there talking the truth and speaking about reality,” he said. “We shouldn’t have to be this way.”Sara Miller, 53, a teacher at a Catholic school, had gone to a Costco in Phoenix on Friday morning to try to buy food for a weekend dinner party. She walked out empty-handed after she saw the lines and the picked-over aisles.“What we’re seeing now is mob mentality and someone needs to talk us out of that, get us out of that kind of thinking of every man for himself,” said Ms. Miller, a lifelong Democrat who mailed in her ballot for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. last week, in large part because she liked his demeanor.

We just really need calm,” she said. “We all have to remember we’re in this together. Do we have someone to remind us?”Arizona is one of a handful of states both Republicans and Democrats believe will be competitive in the general election, and both Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had campaigned there before the outbreak.While Mr. Sanders has so far performed well in the West, particularly in states with large Latino populations, polls in Arizona indicate he is facing an uphill climb here.The vast majority of voters interviewed said they preferred Mr. Biden precisely because he was a familiar presence who they believed could win over moderates here and in other parts of the country. “We all want things that we know, that are familiar. We just really need calm,” she said. “We all have to remember we’re in this together.

Many of his backers are working-class voters who may be most acutely concerned about receiving health care or collecting their paycheck as the pandemic continues to shut down businesses, especially in service industries.Strip mall parking lots in and around Phoenix were full over the weekend, but polling sites were far from it. Dozens of people shopping said they had no intention to vote in the Democratic primary or the November election.At the voting center in the municipal building of Surprise, a suburban community about 30 miles northwest of Phoenix, fewer than 10 voters showed up over three hours Saturday morning.Still, deep dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump was driving some voters to the polls.Steve Brown, 69, who moved from Oregon after retiring as an insurance executive, described himself as “anti-Trump since the day he came down the escalator.”While he said he did not feel worried about his own health, he was “very anxious” that the president’s leadership would mean the virus would “spiral further out of control.”“Voting is always an obligation, but even more so now, when what we have is just terrifying,” said Mr. Brown, who along with his wife voted for Mr. Biden. “We want someone who will not overpromise, who will be honest,” she said. “But so much is changing so fast, I don’t even know what we need to do.”Even some supporters of Mr. Sanders believe that those who are most likely to vote for him are less likely to cast a ballot as the panic over the coronavirus spreads.

I know I was sharper at 60 than I am now.” “Biden will pick the right people to be around him,” Mr. Brown said. “You can look to him like he knows where this is going.”But, Mr. Brown added: “I’m kind of worried about his age. I know I was sharper at 60 than I am now.” For Alfredo Lopez, a 38-year-old engineer who brought both his wife and his father with him to vote just before the polls closed in Mesa on Friday, the global health crisis was one more reason to support “Medicare for all,” a centerpiece of Mr. Sanders’s campaign.“This is really showing us the need for a health care system that works for everybody,” Mr. Lopez said, adding that it was clear to him that many people would be unable to gain access to care or medication. “There’s going to be a peak, and the question is if we are ready for it.”Moments after she cast her ballot in Mesa, Carol Lopez, 40, said she was particularly disturbed that the information coming from the president seemed to contradict advice from medical experts.“People are getting bad information from the person in charge,” she said. “Right now the people who are in charge can’t be trusted.” For Alfredo Lopez, a 38-year-old engineer who brought both his wife and his father with him to vote just before the polls closed in Mesa on Friday, the global health crisis was one more reason to support “Medicare for all,” a centerpiece of Mr. Sanders’s campaign.“This is really showing us the need for a health care system that works for everybody,” Mr. Lopez said, adding that it was clear to him that many people would be unable to gain access to care or medication. “There’s going to be a peak, and the question is if we are ready for it.”Moments after she cast her ballot in Mesa, Carol Lopez, 40, said she was particularly disturbed that the information coming from the president seemed to contradict advice from medical experts.“People are getting bad information from the person in charge,” she said. “Right now the people who are in charge can’t be trusted.” Arizona Democratic Party officials said that there had been “huge turnout” from early mail-in ballots, with 375,000 returned so far, and that the number of voters could easily surpass the 2016 primary.“We’re pressing forward,” Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, who oversees elections in Phoenix and the surrounding suburbs, where the vast majority of registered Democrats in the state live, said Sunday night.Last week, he expressed blustery confidence in the system, saying it was “as calm as it can be.”“We’re prepared for everything,” he said. “Except Godzilla.” Arizona Democratic Party officials said that there had been “huge turnout” from early mail-in ballots, with 375,000 returned so far, and that the number of voters could easily surpass the 2016 primary.“We’re pressing forward,” Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, who oversees elections in Phoenix and the surrounding suburbs, where the vast majority of registered Democrats in the state live, said Sunday night.Last week, he expressed blustery confidence in the system, saying it was “as calm as it can be.”“We’re prepared for everything,” he said. “Except Godzilla.”",When Voting During a Pandemic Is a Way to Feel Normal,2020-03-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/arizona-primary-coronavirus.html,new_york_times
"Senator Bernie Sanders jabbed his finger in the air. He left Joseph R. Biden Jr. resorting to misstatements to defend his stance on bankruptcy legislation. He instructed viewers to “go to the YouTube” to check out the former vice president’s record themselves.It was not the kind of debate performance suggesting a candidate ready for reconciliation.After delivering a speech last week that appeared aimed at de-escalating the primary battle against Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders laced into his opponent on Sunday night with a vigor that signaled that the fight — if not for delegates, then for the soul of the Democratic Party — was not over.Under intense pressure to win nominating contests and already grappling with the effects of the coronavirus on the election, Mr. Sanders and his aides are now struggling to reconcile a sense of resignation and a desire to press on.Yet even as his path to the nomination looks increasingly bleak, with Mr. Biden favored in three more primaries on Tuesday, some allies are publicly urging Mr. Sanders to remain in the race, eager for him to continue to pitch voters on a liberal agenda that he has promoted for decades.

This is not a coronation. We know what happened last time in 2016 — it gave us Donald J. Trump.”This campaign, she added, was “the culmination of this man’s life’s work.”The decision on whether to drop out or continue the campaign is one that ultimately rests with Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, allies and friends say. His inner circle has only grown smaller in recent days, and hardly anyone on his campaign is willing to speculate where he may land. “I want the senator to stay in,” Nina Turner, one of the campaign’s national co-chairs, said in an interview on Monday. “I think other voters have a right to have a choice.

Some Sanders aides and supporters privately acknowledge that his chances are daunting if not impossible given the broad coalition of Democrats that Mr. Biden appears to have assembled, and Mr. Sanders’s inability to bring new voters under his tent. But they describe Mr. Sanders as a fighter, and a headstrong one, whose instinct will be to keep battling. They also see an advantage in continuing to accrue delegates to use as leverage in negotiations with Mr. Biden over potential policy concessions.To several Sanders aides and allies, the aggressiveness their candidate showed on the debate stage was a way of holding Mr. Biden accountable on the issues Mr. Sanders cares deeply about, perhaps fueled by the faint hope that he can persuade voters that he remains the best choice to consolidate the party and defeat President Trump.

And Mr. Sanders risks looking out of step with the times if he persists in extending the primary against long odds, while the nation is in the middle of a public health crisis.Even some of his biggest supporters suggested that the race was effectively over and that the time had come for Democrats to unite behind Mr. Biden.“The chance of getting the nomination is so tiny, the stakes are so high given Trump and coronavirus and the economic fallout, that he does need to face that reality,” Robert Reich, a former labor secretary who endorsed Mr. Sanders, said in an interview on Monday.Mr. Reich said that some onus was on Mr. Biden to demonstrate to Mr. Sanders that he is sufficiently devoted to progressive causes. The former vice president could do that, Mr. Reich said, by naming Mr. Sanders as a top policy adviser to his campaign or by naming Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as his running mate.“It’s the only way he’s going to get the type of enthusiasm he needs,” he said. “Even though Joe Biden is ahead in delegates at the moment, he is far from unifying the party,” Jeff Weaver, a longtime Sanders adviser, said after the debate. “And he hasn’t made the case that he can provide the kind of inspired leadership necessary to beat Donald Trump.”Still, the campaign has not made a major television ad buy since last Wednesday, when it added about $2 million worth, though it did add another $250,000 worth on Thursday, spread across three states originally scheduled to vote on Tuesday: Florida, Illinois and Ohio (on Monday Ohio moved to postpone its primary).

With the Democratic primary at an inflection point as Mr. Sanders considers his next steps, Mr. Biden’s campaign has tried to strike a balance between acting presidential, as if he will be the nominee, and not alienating Mr. Sanders and his loyalists. Last Wednesday, hours after Mr. Biden had collected four more victories, his aides seemed reluctant to call on Mr. Sanders to drop out even as they sent out a memo describing Mr. Biden’s lead as nearly insurmountable.

Last Wednesday, hours after Mr. Biden had collected four more victories, his aides seemed reluctant to call on Mr. Sanders to drop out even as they sent out a memo describing Mr. Biden’s lead as nearly insurmountable. “Should our broad base of support remain — and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise — it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage,” the Biden campaign memo said.After Mr. Sanders refrained from attacking Mr. Biden at a news conference that afternoon, and instead presented a list of policy priorities, some of Mr. Biden’s backers hoped the debate would be the next step toward unifying the party around his candidacy. Mr. Biden’s team believed it had extended an olive branch to Sanders loyalists in the hours before the debate, embracing a version of a plan Mr. Sanders has championed that calls for tuition-free public college for many students.So some Biden backers said they were caught off guard when Mr. Sanders spent much of Sunday’s debate criticizing Mr. Biden’s long record, which revived their broader frustrations with some of Mr. Sanders’s surrogates who have slashed Mr. Biden in more starkly personal terms.“I didn’t expect some of the sharp elbows we saw from the senator,” said state Representative Malcolm Kenyatta, Democrat of Pennsylvania and a Biden supporter, even as he praised Mr. Sanders’s pledge to support the eventual nominee.There were more overt indications of displeasure from the Biden camp directly after the debate. Anita Dunn, Mr. Biden’s chief strategist, compared Mr. Sanders to a political demonstrator, telling reporters that the former vice president had spent the debate “graciously dealing with the kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events, on live television.”Some Sanders advisers are still hoping to eke out victories on Tuesday in Illinois and Arizona but are also cognizant that the outlook looks increasingly challenging. A poll released on Monday showed Mr. Sanders trailing Mr. Biden in Arizona by 20 percentage points. Florida also votes on Tuesday, and aides acknowledge that the state at this point is effectively out of reach. And in a blow that was long in coming, Washington State’s final results were announced on Monday, with Mr. Biden emerging as the victor after nearly a week of counting ballots.Beyond that, the crisis surrounding the coronavirus has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the race, scrambling the primary, forcing Mr. Sanders to forgo his signature rallies and making the process even more unpredictable. “Should our broad base of support remain — and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise — it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage,” the Biden campaign memo said.After Mr. Sanders refrained from attacking Mr. Biden at a news conference that afternoon, and instead presented a list of policy priorities, some of Mr. Biden’s backers hoped the debate would be the next step toward unifying the party around his candidacy.

Speaking with CNN after the debate, Mr. Sanders openly questioned the wisdom of holding primaries during a pandemic.“I would hope governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is, you just indicated, we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Mr. Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, all that stuff. It does not make a lot of sense.”Establishment Democrats are desperately hoping to avoid a reprise of 2016, when Mr. Sanders battled to the bitter end against Hillary Clinton; his posture enraged some in the party who later blamed him for stoking division among Democrats that led to her loss to Mr. Trump.There have been more recent signs that he is reluctant to give up without a fight.Asked recently whether his attacks would weaken Mr. Biden in the general election against Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders grew exasperated. “I heard that back in 2016,” he told reporters in Phoenix, before asking whether anointing a candidate before the race was over was “really what democracy is about.”In an enduring sign of strength, his campaign said it raised $2 million on Sunday, and has hit 10 million individual contributions.Those close to Mr. Sanders say he may want to forge ahead not because he thinks he can still win but to keep his political revolution alive. “This is about building that movement for change, not just about him,” said Larry Cohen, the chairman of the Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution. “Obviously, he wants to be the president on every level, but it’s much deeper than that.” Speaking with CNN after the debate, Mr. Sanders openly questioned the wisdom of holding primaries during a pandemic.“I would hope governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is, you just indicated, we don’t want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Mr. Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, all that stuff.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump, under pressure to take more significant steps to slow the spreading coronavirus, recommended on Monday that Americans stop unnecessary travel and avoid bars, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people, as he warned that the outbreak could extend well into the summer.The national guidelines, which also advise home-schooling and the curtailing of visits to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, are the most robust response so far from the Trump administration. But the guidelines, which officials described as a trial set, are not mandatory and fall short of a national quarantine and internal travel restrictions, which many health officials had urged.And they do not reflect the urgency of actions taken around the world as governments in Italy, France, Spain and elsewhere began imposing stringent lockdowns on citizens. Even within the United States, local governments were imposing shelter-at-home orders and police-enforced quarantine zones.“So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is much lower than the other way had we not done a good job,” Mr. Trump said, “but people are talking about July, August, something like that.” WASHINGTON — President Trump, under pressure to take more significant steps to slow the spreading coronavirus, recommended on Monday that Americans stop unnecessary travel and avoid bars, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people, as he warned that the outbreak could extend well into the summer.The national guidelines, which also advise home-schooling and the curtailing of visits to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, are the most robust response so far from the Trump administration.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the president assumed a more realistic tone than his weeks of casual optimism and hopes that the virus “will disappear.” He said discussions with governors and public health experts had prompted his administration to “further toughen” the guidelines to contain the virus.“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,” Mr. Trump said, “we will rally together as one nation, and we will defeat the virus, and we’re going to have a big celebration all together.”Mr. Trump made his announcement as much of the United States was disoriented by the abrupt closure of schools and businesses and the essential emptying of public life. The 2.1 million-strong work force of the federal government was struggling with a confusing patchwork of guidance on whether or not to work from home. Stock prices weathered another brutal day of trading, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 12 percent, and coronavirus infections in the country soared to well over 4,000 — and well over 181,000 globally.In Chicago, an employee in the Federal Aviation Administration office responsible for airlines at O’Hare International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing the agency to close an office that performs safety and maintenance inspections at one of the nation’s busiest airports.

Mr. Trump angered some governors on a conference call on Monday morning when he told them, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves.” In a recording shared with The New York Times, he was heard adding: “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” Mr. Trump angered some governors on a conference call on Monday morning when he told them, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves.” In a recording shared with The New York Times, he was heard adding: “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” But such realism was the tone of the day. The president’s guidelines appeared to be driven by a new report from London that predicted that without action to stem the spread, the virus could cause more than two million deaths in the United States, and the most effective way to reduce that is to limit interactions among people.“We are at a critical inflection point in this country, people,” Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, said on Fox News. “When you look at the projections, there’s every chance that we could be Italy,” where deaths have topped 2,100.A congressional stimulus package that could cushion the effects of the pandemic hit a snag as lawmakers from both chambers haggled over who could provide a better one.When asked by reporters if the country was headed for a recession, Mr. Trump remarked, “It may be.”“We’re thinking in terms of the virus,” the president said. “Once we stop — I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy. And once this goes away, once it goes through and we’re done with it, I think you’re going to see a tremendous, a tremendous surge.”Mr. Trump’s advisers were less sanguine.“We are going to be challenged, no question about it,” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic adviser, told reporters gathered in the White House driveway earlier on Monday. “We have a big challenge.” But such realism was the tone of the day.

The fate of a multibillion dollar emergency relief package that passed the House overwhelmingly early Saturday seemed uncertain as lawmakers and staff rushed to complete a package of technical changes to the legislation on Monday, even as more offices transitioned to working remotely and at least one lawmaker, Representative Ben Ray Luján, Democrat of New Mexico, announced he would self-quarantine.Shortly after 8 p.m. Monday, the House approved the legislation with its technical changes, using a procedural maneuver that allowed — without the entire chamber present — for the legislation to head to the Senate. Earlier in the day, Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican with a knack for courting controversy, indicated that he might object to the effort on the grounds that the process was rushed, but ultimately agreed to allow the bill to pass.It is unclear how quickly the legislation will move in the Senate.Multiple Republican senators have voiced concerns with the package, particularly provisions that would establish paid sick leave and efforts to help businesses comply with that mandate. Senators and staff have discussed either amending or voting against the proposal, which was largely negotiated between Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.Mr. Trump, who announced his approval for the measure on Twitter late Friday night, appeared to endorse possible Senate changes, telling reporters on Monday, “I think they may make it even better.”And beyond that, lawmakers were floating ideas for another, even larger economic stimulus package that both parties agreed would most likely be necessary.Senate Republicans have opened discussions on a follow-on bill to buffer the economy against the coronavirus. The bill could include direct aid like loans or grants for industries such as the airlines. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called on Monday for Congress to approve loans and loan guarantees for large companies whose business has been disrupted by the virus.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said that any future legislation would help support families and bolster businesses and the health care system, indicating that he and his lieutenants would take a larger role in drafting another piece of legislation. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, proposed allocating at least $750 billion to provide, among other things, immediate loan payment forbearance, affordable testing and emergency child care funding. On Capitol Hill, the lawmakers charged with stanching the economic fallout signaled that a brokered stimulus deal might take longer than planned. The fate of a multibillion dollar emergency relief package that passed the House overwhelmingly early Saturday seemed uncertain as lawmakers and staff rushed to complete a package of technical changes to the legislation on Monday, even as more offices transitioned to working remotely and at least one lawmaker, Representative Ben Ray Luján, Democrat of New Mexico, announced he would self-quarantine.Shortly after 8 p.m. Monday, the House approved the legislation with its technical changes, using a procedural maneuver that allowed — without the entire chamber present — for the legislation to head to the Senate. Earlier in the day, Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican with a knack for courting controversy, indicated that he might object to the effort on the grounds that the process was rushed, but ultimately agreed to allow the bill to pass.It is unclear how quickly the legislation will move in the Senate.Multiple Republican senators have voiced concerns with the package, particularly provisions that would establish paid sick leave and efforts to help businesses comply with that mandate. Senators and staff have discussed either amending or voting against the proposal, which was largely negotiated between Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.Mr. Trump, who announced his approval for the measure on Twitter late Friday night, appeared to endorse possible Senate changes, telling reporters on Monday, “I think they may make it even better.”And beyond that, lawmakers were floating ideas for another, even larger economic stimulus package that both parties agreed would most likely be necessary.Senate Republicans have opened discussions on a follow-on bill to buffer the economy against the coronavirus. The bill could include direct aid like loans or grants for industries such as the airlines.

As lawmakers haggled, Mr. Trump was creating problems of his own in his conversation with the governors.The suggestion that they find their own respirators and ventilators surprised some of them, including those who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and are increasingly looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid. Govs. Jay Inslee of Washington, whose state is at the center of the domestic outbreak, and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico both reacted angrily to the administration’s slow response to the crisis.

One of his Republican colleagues said others had also initiated outreach in an effort to heighten awareness among judges nominated by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W.

Mike Davis, a former nomination counsel for Senate Republicans who created the Article III Project, a conservative judicial advocacy group, said that he still expected Mr. Trump to win, but that “we have to hope for the best and plan for the worst.”Republicans are reminding the judges that it could be another eight years — 2029 — before they could leave under a Republican president.Mr. Davis estimated that judges would need to decide by late summer or early fall to provide sufficient time for a nomination and confirmation.According to a tally by the Article III Project, more than 90 judges nominated by the three previous Republican presidents are either now eligible or will become eligible this year to take what is known as senior status, a form of semiretirement that enables their slots to be filled even though they can still hear cases, hire clerks and receive full pay.

Twenty-eight of them are judges on the influential appeals courts, which have been a particular focus of the alliance between the Trump White House and Senate Republicans. One of them, Judge Thomas B. Griffith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, announced earlier this month that he planned to retire in September, giving Mr. Trump the opportunity to make a third appointment to the powerful court in what will most likely be a contentious confirmation fight.

Mr. Trump has already placed more than 50 appeals court judges on the bench during the past three years — more than a quarter of the overall appellate bench. The aggressive Republican push has been so efficient that only one appellate seat is currently open. Conservatives are eager to see some of the longer-tenured judges make room for younger candidates who could continue deciding cases for decades.David Popp, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said it should come as no surprise that he would be interested in the tenure plans of current judges.“I'd point you back to his long-running mantra of ‘leave no vacancy behind,’” Mr. Popp said of Mr. McConnell, who has for months made it clear that he intended to fill as many judicial slots as possible before the end of this year.Mr. McConnell has long been intently focused on the federal courts and considers his record on installing conservative judges the hallmark of his career, along with his decision to block the 2016 Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. The Courier-Journal, based in Louisville, Ky., reported that Mr. McConnell flew there Thursday with Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh for the investiture of a new U.S. District Court judge, Justin Walker, a 38-year-old former Kavanaugh clerk whom the Senate confirmed despite questions about his experience level.Democrats have already made it clear that they intend to try to counter the successful Republican effort to place conservatives on the courts if they get the chance. Progressive advocates have also publicly encouraged sitting judges nominated by Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to delay their retirements until after the election to deny Republicans more vacancies, but they did not appear to be going so far as to call judges personally to encourage them to consider doing so.Critics said the tactic by Mr. McConnell and other conservatives is inappropriate, and shows that his policy agenda is unpalatable to most Americans.

He predicted that his counterpart’s emphasis on the courts “will significantly hurt Republican senators in November.”“If Mitch McConnell is having direct conversations to pressure sitting federal judges to basically retire so Trump can name more picks, it is court-packing in a different form,” said Brian Fallon, the executive director of the progressive judicial group Demand Justice. “It raises the question of what, if anything, McConnell is offering them to take senior status earlier than planned. This type of hand-in-glove coordination shows how utterly politicized the judicial branch is.”Republicans have sent signals about judicial retirements in the past. In May 2018, with a midterm election looming that could have flipped the Senate, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time, openly urged any Supreme Court justice pondering retirement to pull the trigger.“If you are thinking about quitting this year, do it yesterday,” Mr. Grassley said during a radio interview. “If we have a Democrat Senate, you’re never going to get the kind of people that are strict constructionists.”Justice Anthony M. Kennedy stepped down a little more than a month later and was replaced by Justice Kavanaugh, his former clerk.While acknowledging the continuing lobbying effort, other Republicans were uncertain how effective it could be given the traditional independence of federal judges holding lifetime appointments.“Federal judges have very strong independent streaks, and you can’t make them do it,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a senior Republican member of the Judiciary Committee. “Unless they see some benefit to themselves, I don’t expect people to do it.” “Senator McConnell knows he can’t achieve any of his extreme goals legislatively, so he continues to attempt to pull America to the far right by packing the courts,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in a statement.

With in-person campaigning frozen indefinitely by the virus, the importance of advertising and free news media coverage is most likely going to be of heightened importance going forward. With in-person campaigning frozen indefinitely by the virus, the importance of advertising and free news media coverage is most likely going to be of heightened importance going forward. A combined more than $21 million in television ads has been spent in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — and in every state, Mr. Sanders spent more than Mr. Biden and his supportive super PAC combined. The priciest state, by far, is Florida, where Mr. Sanders had poured nearly $6 million and Mr. Biden spent $5.3 million, despite polling in March that has shown Mr. Biden with a large lead in the state. Mr. Sanders is the bigger spender online, too.In the past seven days, Mr. Sanders has spent about $247,000 on Facebook ads in Illinois — nearly five times the $53,000 that Mr. Biden spent. It was a similar story across all four states, with Mr. Sanders ($106,000) far outpacing Mr. Biden (nearly $20,000) in Arizona and doubling him in Florida.More than 300,000 absentee ballots have been cast in Arizona.More than 380,000 Democrats in Arizona have already cast their ballots in the primary. Like other states in the West, Arizona Democrats are a diverse group — with white voters making up about half of voters, while Latinos make up about 36 percent and black voters account for about 9 percent of all voters, according to an analysis by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.While Mr. Sanders has done well among Latino voters elsewhere in the West, a poll released by Univision late last week indicated Mr. Sanders held just a five-point lead ahead of Mr. Biden.In polling conducted earlier this month, voters indicated that their greatest concern was reducing health care costs, with roughly 60 percent saying they supported moving toward a system that “guarantees health care for everyone.”Though Arizona Democrats have said they expect a record number of voters to cast their ballots by mail, the outbreak of the pandemic has unquestionably changed the atmosphere — many voters have said they prefer Mr. Biden because of his experience. But the electorate is likely to split along ideological lines, with Mr. Sanders’s supporters saying that the current crisis underscores the need for “Medicare for All.” A combined more than $21 million in television ads has been spent in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — and in every state, Mr. Sanders spent more than Mr. Biden and his supportive super PAC combined.

What’s turnout going to be like in Arizona? Arizona offered several emergency early-voting options as the coronavirus pandemic escalated. Matt Grodsky, a party spokesman, said on Monday that early turnout alone might surpass the total turnout in the 2016 presidential primary race.Many counties — including Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and Mesa, and Pima County, which includes Tucson — are also offering curbside pickup outside precincts Tuesday so that voters can turn in their ballots without having to enter crowded polling sites.Officials said they had chosen not to postpone the primary in part because so many Arizonans vote early anyway.“Safety procedures have been put in place at every polling location,” Mr. Grodsky said. “We believe that delaying the election would cause undue chaos to this election process.”A video released by Gov. Doug Ducey and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said that those safety procedures included setting “regular intervals” for poll workers to wash their hands, and sanitizing voting equipment and other commonly touched surfaces. Voters will be asked to wash their hands both before entering the precinct and after leaving it.Maggie Astor and Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

(There are also less suspenseful — though possibly still high-turnout — Republican primaries in Florida and Illinois.) Officials are working to ensure that sanitary products and hygienic guidelines are distributed to polling places.Ohio’s primary will not be held today as planned — but that’s only after an intrastate squabble played out late into the evening on Monday. First, Mike DeWine, the state’s Republican governor, expressed support for a plan to postpone the election to June 2. On Monday afternoon, he said he didn’t have the authority to do it alone. But when a county judge shot down the effort that night, DeWine announced that the state’s health director was ordering polls not to open. “To conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,” DeWine said on Twitter. It remains unclear whether in-person voting will indeed take place on June 2.Ohio is the fourth state to move its primary in response to the virus. On Monday, Kentucky pushed its primary back five weeks, joining Louisiana and Georgia, which both decided last week to delay their elections.Theoretically, a pandemic can turn anything on its side. But Joe Biden has a daunting lead in all the states set to vote today, according to polling averages. So he probably feels confident in his ability to avoid an upset, even under these extraordinary circumstances. A Monmouth University poll of Arizona released yesterday showed Bernie Sanders trailing Biden by 20 percentage points. Among Latino voters, who have been one of his most supportive constituencies, Sanders was up by only seven points. In Illinois, little credible polling has been done, but Biden’s campaign is expecting a comfortable victory after his convincing win in nearby Michigan. In Florida, where the Hispanic population trends more conservative and the white population skews older, Biden is particularly well positioned. Sanders’s path to the nomination may be narrow, but at Sunday’s debate he showed that he’s not going to leave the Democratic race without a fight. Seeking to ensure that progressive ideals remain front and center as attention turns to the general election, Sanders argued that the response to the coronavirus must be understood as only one element of the country’s health care system. When Biden said he would make testing and treatment for the coronavirus free to all Americans, Sanders said the same guarantee should apply to Americans experiencing any health catastrophe.“Last year, at least 30,000 people died in America because they didn’t get health care when they should, because we don’t have universal coverage,” Sanders said. “I think that’s a crisis. One out of five people in America cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. They suffer. Some die. I consider that a crisis.”Biden grabbed headlines during the debate when he committed to choosing a woman as his running mate if he’s the nominee. But that doesn’t mean he’s already made a choice, and his campaign signaled Monday that he would still put prospects through a “vigorous vetting process.” Among those seen as possibilities are three former presidential candidates: Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.

As the coronavirus closes restaurants and businesses, and many thousands — perhaps millions — of Americans prepare to lose their paychecks, Yang has been on Twitter practically screaming a diplomatic version of “I told you so!” “Putting money into people’s hands is the obvious thing to do in this situation,” he tweeted early Monday. “I hope Congress wakes up to this before it’s too late. Every day is enormous at this point.”And as of Monday afternoon, at least one major political figure appeared to have joined him in backing a universal basic income.Senator Mitt Romney of Utah released a series of proposals on Monday aimed at lessening the hardship for Americans facing a financial burden because of the coronavirus. At the top of the list: “Immediately send $1,000 checks to each American.”“Every American adult should immediately receive $1,000 to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy,” a news release from Romney’s office said. “The check will help fill the gaps for Americans that may not quickly navigate different government options.” By the end of the day, Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic presidential candidate, had also endorsed a $1,000 basic payment. “Putting money into people’s hands is the obvious thing to do in this situation,” he tweeted early Monday. “I hope Congress wakes up to this before it’s too late.

There are other hints, maybe, that bipartisanship isn’t quite dead.In addition to death, destruction and a spirit of panic, the coronavirus may also be delivering what no politician in years has been able to achieve: bipartisan agreement in Washington.Romney wasn’t the only Republican on Monday to endorse including direct cash payments in a stimulus package. Tom Cotton, a conservative senator from Arkansas, appeared to be standing to Nancy Pelosi’s left when he criticized a bill negotiated between the House and the White House.  The proposed legislation “doesn’t go far enough, and it doesn’t go fast enough,” Cotton said on Fox News on Monday. “I and a lot of other senators who I’ve spoken to over the weekend are worried that we’re not doing enough to get cash into the hands of affected workers and families quickly.”Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said he wants to pass the House bill immediately — words that are rarer than platinum from him. That bill includes access to free coronavirus testing, paid leave for displaced workers, expanded unemployment benefits and food stamps, and extra Medicaid funding.For weeks, President Trump was slow to publicly acknowledge the severity of the coronavirus threat, but even he has begun to emphasize the need for drastic action. On Monday he discouraged gatherings of 10 or more people.  “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus,” he said in comments to reporters. “We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it.”Still, a partisan divide persists among the general public, driven in part by the differing stories being told by mainstream and conservative news outlets. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted at the end of last week found that while a majority of Democrats described themselves as “very concerned” about the coronavirus spreading to their community, just 17 percent of Republicans said the same. Interestingly, the number among independents was nearly as low: 20 percent.

"Turnout is a question ahead of every election. It would be an understatement to say it is a more challenging question than usual ahead of Tuesday’s primaries, as voters head to the polls in Florida, Illinois and Arizona amid the coronavirus pandemic.Although it’s hard to forecast the impact of coronavirus on turnout, there are a few hard facts that, on balance, suggest it might have less of an effect than one might expect in Florida and Arizona. But Illinois might be somewhat more vulnerable to a decline in turnout. (On Monday, Ohio’s governor postponed the state’s primary over health concerns.)One factor is sure to blunt the effect of the coronavirus: early voting. Already, millions of voters in these states have cast their ballots either in person or by mail. Early voters are almost always older than the overall electorate, which tends to mitigate the possibility that such voters, who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus, won’t match their typical share of the vote.

Early voters are almost always older than the overall electorate, which tends to mitigate the possibility that such voters, who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus, won’t match their typical share of the vote. Historically, early voters represent an especially large share of the electorate in Arizona, which has a large list of permanent absentee voters. These voters in Arizona tend to be much older: Over all, 34 percent of registered Democrats who are permanent absentee voters are over 65, compared with 20 percent of registered Democrats who aren’t permanent absentees, according to data from L2, a nonpartisan political data firm.

In 2016, 81 percent of Democrats in Arizona cast their ballots ahead of the election. So far this year, the state has already received more Democratic ballots than it did four years ago. Alone, that’s enough to significantly insulate the state from the effects of the coronavirus.Florida also has extensive in-person and early voting. Nearly one million Democrats have already voted there, or about 55 percent of the total turnout from the 2016 Democratic primary. Early voters tend to be older in Florida as well. In 2016, of those between 18 and 24 who voted, 62 percent voted on Election Day. That’s compared with just 39 percent of voters over age 65 who did so, according to an analysis by Matthew Isbell, a Democratic political consultant in Florida.Illinois has below-average rates of absentee voting. Nearly 400,000 voters have cast ballots, but this tally includes both Democratic and Republican voters. It suggests that only around 10 percent of Democratic primary voters have cast ballots there, making the state much more susceptible to a decline in Election Day turnout. Another factor that might shape turnout is the number of known coronavirus cases. This could affect whether voters perceive a substantial risk in voting. None of these states have a particularly high rate of confirmed coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by The New York Times.

By this measure, Arizona again seems relatively insulated from suppressed turnout: The state currently has just 18 known cases, or 2.5 cases per million residents. Florida and Illinois, on the other hand, have somewhat higher numbers. There are 138 known cases in Florida, or 6.4 per million, and 95 in Illinois, or 7.5 cases per million. Both are still beneath the national average.

There, turnout was down by 20 percent from the last election in 2014. It was a significant decline in turnout, but perhaps not one that bodes especially poorly for the elections in the U.S. on Tuesday. After all, there are more than 83 cases per million French resident, or more than 10 times the rate of Illinois, and there is no substantial early voting.There is no reason to assume that American and French voters will respond to the coronavirus threat in the same way. But if they did, the turnout in today’s primaries would presumably remain relatively strong.If turnout did drop because of coronavirus, it’s hard to say which candidate would benefit. Older voters would seem likeliest to stay home. They face the greatest health risks from coronavirus, and older Democrats tend to be most concerned about it, according to data from Civiqs. A lower turnout among older voters would tend to hurt Joe Biden, who has won older voters by a wide margin.On the other hand, older voters are likeliest to have already voted, and they are the most reliable voters in general.

Confirmed cases tend to be concentrated in metropolitan areas, where Bernie Sanders has usually fared best in the contests since South Carolina. In Illinois, for instance, most cases are in Cook County, which includes Chicago and around half of Illinois Democrats. Cook County has 70 known coronavirus cases, or 13.4 per million residents. One could argue that turnout is likeliest to drop there, and that might be bad news for Mr. Sanders, who seems likely to get swept in the state’s rural areas and suburbs.Ultimately, even a significant coronavirus turnout effect would be unlikely to change the trajectory of the race. Mr. Biden leads by a wide margin in all three states, based on the polls and recent election results. If he wins by anything like the kind of margins suggested by the polls, he could end the night with an all but insurmountable lead in the pledged delegate count.

Droplets from coughs or sneezes from an infected person can be left on surfaces and then touched by uninfected people. If those people do not wash their hands thoroughly before touching their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected with a virus and then go on to infect others.Respiratory viruses include influenza as well as those that can cause influenza-like illnesses, such as upper respiratory infections (the common cold), viral sinusitis, viral bronchitis and viral ear infections. Every year, they infect millions and kill thousands of Americans; health officials closely track cases by the week.How we conducted the experimentTo test the hypothesis that these elections could lead to more viral infections, we used a large national insurance database focusing on the years 2007 to 2016. This database included more than 14.5 million patients over 40, an age group we chose to study because they are more likely to vote.We calculated rates of influenza infection or influenza-like illness for the 21 days after federal elections, which fall on the first Tuesday of November. We chose a 21-day window to allow enough time for any newly infected patients to fall ill and seek medical care. In years without an election, we calculated infection rates for the 21 days after the first Tuesday of November — the day that would have been Election Day had there been a federal election.We then grouped the data into years with a presidential election, years with a midterm election, and years with no election. Although state or local elections might have taken place in the years without a federal election, they would have drawn far fewer voters, and so these years made a good group for comparison.

Although state or local elections might have taken place in the years without a federal election, they would have drawn far fewer voters, and so these years made a good group for comparison. We found that among adults over age 40, rates of doctor visits for viral illnesses gradually increased in the weeks before and after the first Tuesday in November — as we would expect in every cold and flu season — but election years were no different than years without an election.This suggests that there was no major difference in outpatient visits for viral infections in years with elections years versus those without.While we observed minor differences between presidential, midterm and nonelection years, they were within the margin of error of our model and are more likely related to varying severity of the overall flu season for the years included in each group.A number of factors could explain these findings. First, polling locations bring in voters only from a local community; if a virus is not circulating in that community, it cannot be spread at a polling location. Second, voting is a brief individual activity in which the main potential for viral spread is through touching common surfaces. If surfaces are disinfected periodically and voters wash their hands or wear gloves, viral spread could be easily limited.In contrast, a music festival or international tennis tournament attracts crowds from afar who pack into a crowd, spreading their respiratory droplets as they talk, sing, scream and cheer before returning home.Up to a third of voters might not have cast their ballots in person on Election Day, instead using absentee balloting or mail-in votes. While respiratory viruses can theoretically survive for days outside the body — such as on a licked mail-in ballot envelope — it stands to reason that in-person voting carries greater potential for person-to-person viral spread than mail-in voting. The election expert Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at U.C. Irvine, has recently called on Congress to pass a law making it easy for Americans in all states to cast absentee ballots in November.Decisions by election officialsOur analysis was designed to detect a large-scale, national effect of voting on spread of viral disease. Person-to-person viral transmission certainly occurs at polling locations. Small but difficult-to-measure outbreaks may also occur, but our statistical model was not designed to detect these, nor can it be extrapolated to coronavirus.

While some officials embraced that view, cyberexperts who examined the incident said it was little different than the thousands of routine attempts that companies and government agencies fend off daily, as hackers and security researchers scan the internet for weak spots.The secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, told reporters at a news conference with President Trump on Monday that whatever happened had been unsuccessful.“Fortunately we have extremely strong barriers,” he said. “We had no penetration into our networks. We had no degradation of the functioning of our networks.

They say they are spending a disproportionate amount of time scanning social media, trying to gather whatever information they can from anonymous posts by doctors in Seattle, New York and even Italy.“Right now, we are flying blind, sharing snippets from anonymous doctors over Facebook and Twitter,” said Jennifer Ellice, an emergency room doctor in Los Angeles. “We can’t wait for the usual evidence-based, peer-reviewed data in journals and professional association guidelines.”Dr. Ellice and her colleagues were pleading Monday for a technological platform, such as a mobile app, that could validate and authorize licensed physicians to share real-time information that would, for example, tell them whether emergency room patients showing extreme gastrointestinal distress may be stricken with the coronavirus.“We are making policy decisions by word of mouth,” Dr. Ellice said.Doctors say they were wading through misinformation — what World Health Organization officials call an “infodemic” of lies and rumors — in search of real-time information from doctors around the country.

Then Sunday’s debate, originally planned for Phoenix, was moved to Washington and conducted without a live audience.Now we’re at the point where some states are postponing voting in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Louisiana, Georgia and Kentucky have all pushed back their primary elections. In Ohio, a last-minute move has only added to the uncertainty. Ohio was one of four states scheduled to hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday, but its governor, Mike DeWine, recommended on Monday afternoon that it move its election to June 2 and allow mail-in voting to continue until then.“It is clear that tomorrow’s in-person voting does not conform and cannot conform with these C.D.C. guidelines,” Mr. DeWine said, referring to a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that any events in the United States be canceled or postponed where 50 people or more are expected to gather.On Monday evening, a county judge rejected the governor’s request. But Mr. DeWine said late Monday night that he and top state health officials would ignore that ruling and order the polls closed by declaring a public health emergency. (Track the latest developments here.)Florida, Illinois and Arizona have decided to press on with their primaries on Tuesday, so expect hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes to be distributed at polling places. And expect the coronavirus to be going around at some of them, experts say.“Currently, the state of the situation is that the virus is in the community, probably more than is actually reported,” Dr. E. Hanh Le, the senior director of medical affairs at Healthline, said in an interview. “Many of the symptoms are so mild, a lot of people are reporting that they don’t have any symptoms at all.

She has been closely following preparations at the state level, and she expressed satisfaction with the precautions being taken.“Particularly for states like Arizona and Florida, where there’s a higher population of older voters, they’ve done a great job I think of pre-emptively preparing themselves,” she said. That includes “making sure that their polling stations and poll employees know what to do in terms of accepting people when they come; making sure the machines are cleaned before and throughout the day, so that when people come in they’re not contaminating each other.”In Florida, the most delegate-rich state on the Democratic calendar Tuesday, more than 100 cases of the virus have been confirmed, and at least three people have been killed by it, according to a New York Times database. Mark Ard, a spokesman for Florida’s Division of Elections, said the state was coordinating its response with the 67 county election supervisors and was helping provide counties with health supplies.“We are working with the supervisors of elections to make sure they’re prepared and they have what they need, working with their emergency management officials to make sure that they have what they need,” he said in an interview.Polling sites in Florida, Illinois and Arizona have been moved out of many senior centers in order to prevent voters from coming into contact with higher-risk, elderly voters. “Our recommendation would be if there’s a polling location in an assisted living facility, allow the residents to vote there,” Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said Wednesday. “But maybe the general public should have the option or be directed to go to a different polling location.” In the Bay Area, where voting in the California primary has already occurred, local officials have issued a shelter-at-home order, effectively barring people from leaving their homes under most circumstances.But in states that vote Tuesday, officials are doing an elaborate dance, encouraging people to stay home except when absolutely necessary — while also reassuring voters that it’s OK to take part in the political process.Dr. Le said that despite the seriousness of the virus, voters who take necessary precautions shouldn’t feel obligated to stay home.

Adrian Fontes, the county recorder, who is a Democrat, announced a plan to mail ballots to all Democrats who had not yet cast early votes. But the state’s attorney general, Mark Brnovich, a Republican, acquired a restraining order to prevent Mr. Fontes from sending the ballots.The Arizona secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is now seeking legislation that could prevent hangups like this in the future, by allowing election officials to authorize all-mail elections in cases of emergency like this one.

Monday mailbag: Biden’s V.P. shortlist Monday mailbag: Biden’s V.P. shortlist This morning, we listed Senators Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren as some of the possible running mates for Joe Biden after he declared he would select a woman for the job. Eric Wiesenthal of Sacramento writes:Your bullet on possible V.P. candidates was easy, but not very imaginative. I agree with you listing the women who’ve run this time, but I would suggest you and your team begin investigating possible African-American and Latinx candidates. Stacey Abrams of Georgia comes to mind, as does Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. My guess is there is a robust shortlist of women of color who would bring youth, energy and genuine excitement for what the Democrats will offer.Our colleague Katie Glueck gave us an update on the thinking in the Biden camp:While Mr. Biden is certainly not yet the nominee, he has mentioned by name, or alluded to, a long list of potential running mates, including many of his former rivals. And his allies are already quietly — and largely unofficially — debating the merits of various vice-presidential candidates, mainly focusing on the names Mr. Biden himself has floated in public.One school of thought holds that Mr. Biden must choose a running mate who reflects the racial diversity of the Democratic Party, and he is already facing pressure from some of his most loyal backers to select an African-American woman in recognition of his unique debt to black voters.Another view is that the stakes of the election are so high, and Democrats are so focused on beating Mr. Trump, that Mr. Biden is likely to have wide latitude to choose whichever person he concludes is likeliest to help him win the general election. And choosing a popular woman for the vice presidency might be greeted with strong enough enthusiasm within the Democratic Party to offset any reservations about an all-white ticket.Some close to Mr. Biden’s campaign have noted that he appears fond of Ms. Klobuchar, who endorsed him before Super Tuesday. He went on to win her home state, Minnesota, despite never having campaigned there this cycle, and he seemed visibly incredulous at his results watch party that evening when he noted the victory, a reflection of how unexpected it was.A day after Ms. Harris dropped out of the race, Mr. Biden said: “She can be the president one day herself. She can be the vice president.” She rallied with him on the eve of the Michigan primary, and he dealt a major blow to Mr. Sanders in that contest. There are still bruised feelings among some in the Biden camp over her lacerating remarks about his views on busing during a debate-stage clash, but Mr. Biden has said that he doesn’t hold grudges.

He went on to win her home state, Minnesota, despite never having campaigned there this cycle, and he seemed visibly incredulous at his results watch party that evening when he noted the victory, a reflection of how unexpected it was.A day after Ms. Harris dropped out of the race, Mr. Biden said: “She can be the president one day herself. She can be the vice president.” She rallied with him on the eve of the Michigan primary, and he dealt a major blow to Mr. Sanders in that contest. There are still bruised feelings among some in the Biden camp over her lacerating remarks about his views on busing during a debate-stage clash, but Mr. Biden has said that he doesn’t hold grudges. He has also expressed openness to Ms. Warren, though more recently he emphasized her value in the Senate. Still, he said on the debate stage on Sunday that they had spoken recently, and over the weekend he endorsed her bankruptcy proposal.In November, he alluded to several other women outside of Washington: Ms. Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and 2018 nominee for governor; Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general who was fired by President Trump early in his term; and Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.Other names generating chatter include Ms. Cortez Masto of Nevada, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Representative Val Demings of Florida. But in an MSNBC interview on Monday, Ms. Whitmer appeared to take herself out of the running. “It is not going to be me, but I’m going to have a hand in helping make sure that he has got the rounded-out ticket that can win,” she said.

"WASHINGTON — The Senate voted on Monday to temporarily reinstate a handful of newly expired F.B.I. tools for investigating terrorism and espionage in an attempt to grant lawmakers time to sort out broader differences over surveillance laws and move to addressing the coronavirus pandemic.Senators unanimously agreed to extend until early June the F.B.I. powers, put into place after the Sept. 11 attacks, without making other changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.The House would also have to agree to an extension in order for it to have the force of law. The timing of such a vote was unclear on Monday evening.Senate leaders had tried last week to head off the expiration on Sunday of the tools by fast-tracking a bipartisan bill passed by the House.

The bill renewed the F.B.I. authorities and went further, instituting other new privacy and transparency protections for Americans under FISA. But senators demanding a full debate over government spying and civil liberties objected, and lawmakers simply ran out of time. The issue now is primarily timing. While the House’s overhaul is still ultimately likely to pass the Senate with votes from both parties, a delay became necessary when other senators warned that a protracted surveillance debate this week could slow any response to the rapidly unfolding financial and health crises caused by the coronavirus outbreak.“FISA needs to be carefully reviewed,” Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said on Twitter on Sunday. “That takes time. That can wait. The emergency response to #coronavirus should be the first order of business in the Senate tomorrow.”In agreeing to extend the programs for more than two months, lawmakers pushing for a fuller review of the House’s bill won a commitment that Republican leaders would allow the Senate to vote on a limited number of proposals to put in place even more stringent privacy protections for Americans.“We’re doing the right thing,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who had been agitating most vocally to delay passage of the House’s bipartisan measure.But in the delicate political balancing act of surveillance laws, the Senate’s action did not necessarily guarantee the short-term extension of the F.B.I. investigative authorities. The House is out this week, meaning that even if Democratic leaders signed off an extension, any member could object. Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas and a staunch opponent of the bill, is already in Washington threatening to block the approval of technical changes to a coronavirus relief bill; he could do so with the surveillance extension as well.

House leaders were discussing the Senate’s measure, a senior Democratic aide said late Monday.President Trump’s unpredictability on surveillance issues could also upend negotiations. The president hinted last week that he might not sign the bill because it did not rein in spying aggressively enough. But Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, later said the president assured him that he would.The Senate’s action on Monday is an effort to put off until June the expiration of four F.B.I. powers dating to the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, including one authority that most lawmakers agree should expire.Under that authority, the National Security Agency is allowed to operate a system that could swiftly access logs of Americans’ domestic phone calls on the servers of phone companies, enabling counterterrorism analysts to scrutinize social links in search of hidden associates of terrorism suspects.The Freedom Act system replaced a previously secret program in which the agency systematically vacuumed up logs of Americans’ phone records tracing back to the Sept. 11 attacks. It was exposed in the 2013 leaks by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden.But the Freedom Act system proved dysfunctional, expensive and inadequate. The National Security Agency repeatedly had to purge the records it collected from the system after discovering that phone companies had sent more data than the agency had the legal authority to sift through.The agency spent about $100 million on the system between 2015 and 2019, when it shut down the program, and obtained only two intelligence leads that the F.B.I. did not already know about, according to a recently declassified report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.The most frequently used of the three powers that the F.B.I. is keeping for now is the ability to get a FISA court order to obtain business records deemed relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation. The other two involve special FISA wiretaps: one that lets the F.B.I. swiftly follow a suspect who changes phones to evade monitoring, and one that lets the F.B.I. target a “lone wolf” terrorism suspect who lacks ties to a foreign group like Al Qaeda.

The House passed its bill, the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act, last week by cobbling together an atypical coalition of Democrats and Republicans to extend three of the four expiring F.B.I. tools and make some changes to the FISA court and traditional FISA wiretaps.For example, the bill would expand when FISA judges — who normally hear only from the Justice Department when weighing surveillance applications — should appoint an outsider to critique the government’s arguments. Under the bill, outsiders should be appointed when an application “presents exceptional concerns” about First Amendment rights, which could apply to investigations touching on political campaigns or religious activity.It would also make clear that the government cannot use a FISA business records order to collect information — like cellphone location data, which in a criminal investigation requires a search warrant — that has a higher legal standard.And it would expand criminal penalties for misusing FISA, raising from five years to eight the prison sentence for engaging in electronic surveillance without following its procedures.

"A Connecticut man has been arrested on charges that he threatened to kill Representative Adam Schiff of California, the Democrat who was the lead impeachment manager in the House during the proceedings against President Trump, federal prosecutors announced on Monday.The man, Robert M. Phelps, 62, of Torrington, Conn., used a meeting request form on Mr. Schiff’s congressional website to send the expletive-laden threats, which were made on Nov. 12, the eve of the first public impeachment hearing, according to a criminal complaint.Mr. Phelps was taken into custody on Friday and made a brief appearance the same day in U.S. District Court in Connecticut. He was at least the third person to be charged with threatening Mr. Schiff, a former federal prosecutor who became the face of the impeachment case against Mr. Trump. Several other Democratic lawmakers have faced similar death threats.Prosecutors said that Mr. Phelps wrote, “I want to come and see you so I can spit in your face and I want to kill you with my bare hands and smash your sick little round fat lying face in.” A Connecticut man has been arrested on charges that he threatened to kill Representative Adam Schiff of California, the Democrat who was the lead impeachment manager in the House during the proceedings against President Trump, federal prosecutors announced on Monday.The man, Robert M.

"Senior aides battling one another for turf, and advisers protecting their own standing. A president who is racked by indecision and quick to blame others and who views events through the lens of how the news media covers them. A pervasive distrust of career government professionals, and disregard for their recommendations. And a powerful son-in-law whom aides fear crossing, but who is among the few people the president trusts.The culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years in the White House has shaped his administration’s response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives.It explains how Mr. Trump could announce he was dismissing his acting chief of staff as the crisis grew more severe, creating even less clarity in an already fractured chain of command. And it was a major factor in the president’s reluctance to even acknowledge a looming crisis, for fear of rattling the financial markets that serve as his political weather vane.“What begins every kind of mobilized response by the president — clear assignments and some sense that this is an absolute priority — none of that seemed to be a part of the president’s discussion,” said Kathleen Sebelius, who served as the health and human services secretary under President Barack Obama. “The agencies were kind of left to their own devices.” Senior aides battling one another for turf, and advisers protecting their own standing.

Biden Jr. and the so-called czar handling the response to the Ebola outbreak under President Barack Obama. “But it was inevitable, sadly, that it would come, and here it is.”Without the dedicated pandemic team on the White House’s National Security Council, which was disbanded in 2018, the management of the government’s vast coronavirus response fell to Alex M.

Azar II, a former drug executive and Mr. Trump’s health and human services secretary. But almost as a matter of course Mr. Trump did not want to highlight the virus as a public health threat when it was developing in China in January. Concerned about rattling financial markets, he signaled to advisers that he wanted to play it down, seizing on a health expert’s belief that the coronavirus might follow traditional influenza patterns and weaken after April. He told members of his private club, Mar-a-Lago, and said publicly that any danger would pass by April 1.As the threat of the coronavirus accelerated, Mr. Azar and a small group of health officials with decades of government experience, including Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, began daily meetings on the sixth floor of health and human services’ Washington headquarters.The group was officially designated as a 12-person “task force” in late January by the departing chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, but personal disputes quickly sprang up as pressure grew from other agencies and departments to be involved.Among the members of the task force, Dr. Fauci, an infectious disease expert who first became prominent explaining the AIDS epidemic to President Ronald Reagan, emerged as an effective spokesman who did not shrink from contradicting Mr. Trump.

But senior administration officials have criticized Mr. Azar for what they believe was a decision to leave key health figures off the task force early on, particularly Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner and an accomplished oncologist, and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency in charge of health care for tens of millions of older and poor Americans, absences the officials attributed to petty turf wars.A health and human services official defended Mr. Azar, saying that the department included the Medicare agency and the F.D.A. in coronavirus meetings well before the two joined the task force.Ms. Verma, who has feuded so intensely with Mr. Azar that it led to an intervention from Mr. Trump, was a top Indiana health official during Mr. Pence’s time as governor in the state, as was Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, another new member of the task force.Joe Grogan, the White House Domestic Policy Council director who has feuded with Mr. Azar over drug policy, and Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser, have irritated some health officials over comments they made about the potential economic impacts of virus containment.At one point early in the crisis, while the president was at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Grogan tried to consolidate coronavirus work within the Domestic Policy Council, which the National Security Council had taken the lead on at the White House, irking health officials.At times the internal tensions have broken out in the open. In an Oval Office meeting last week, Mr. Trump was told that Dr. Redfield had told Politico reporters about a looming shortage in materials the C.D.C. uses to extract genetic material from patient samples.After Mr. Trump asked about the supply problem, Mr. Azar turned to his C.D.C. chief and asked whether he was going to answer the president, according to three senior administration officials who heard about the testy exchange.

Mr. Kushner’s early involvement with dealing with the virus was in advising the president that the media’s coverage exaggerated the threat. But when Mr. Pence’s chief of staff asked him to help merge the Pence and Trump communications operations because the two-person shop in the vice president’s office found itself overwhelmed and trying to keep up, Mr. Kushner, long critical of the White House communications shop, tried to supplement the vice president’s team with other aides.

He urged his father-in-law to go ahead with a ban on some travel from Europe and to declare a national emergency, after Mr. Trump had dithered and second-guessed himself for agreeing to it. He got executives at several pharmaceutical corporations to agree to help with mobilized testing efforts, and has pushed for an increase in medical supplies to hospitals.But after Mr. Trump delivered an error-ridden Oval Office address last week, the president followed it with an appearance Friday in the Rose Garden in which he said Google had developed a coronavirus testing website that did not exist. Mr. Kushner was deeply involved in both efforts, and had sold his father-in-law on the website as a smart concept.By Sunday evening, Mr. Trump was raging to aides that the press coverage was terrible after the promised national website failed to materialize. And on Monday, after Mr. Pence had been praised for his calm demeanor, Mr. Trump decided to answer questions from reporters himself.“They’re working hand in hand,” Mr. Trump said in a White House news conference, flanked by members of the task force. “I think they’re doing really a great job.”As for his own performance during the crisis? “I’d rate it a 10,” Mr. Trump said.

As states and municipalities impose measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, four more primary elections had been slated for Tuesday worth a combined 577 delegates, the third biggest haul available in the entire primary season. But on Monday, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio announced that he was pushing for voting in the state to be extended to June 2 — with no in-person voting occurring Tuesday. Then a judge rejected that plan, leaving the status of Ohio’s election unclear just hours before voting was to begin.The other states — Arizona, Florida and Illinois — were still planning to hold elections during a viral outbreak so severe that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended against any gatherings of more than 50 people across the country.

The biggest prize on Tuesday — Florida, with 219 delegates — is set up to be a particularly poor match for Mr. Sanders, with its older residents, and a Latino population less inclined toward his democratic socialist message.Sanders needs a miracle.Tuesday’s contests aren’t expected to be good for Mr. Sanders. There are large concentrations of older voters, black voters and suburbanites who have flocked to Mr. Biden in the states that have voted so far.After losing Michigan by 16 percentage points despite going all-in on his campaign there, the Vermont senator faces the prospect of losing Arizona, Florida and Illinois by wide margins. He’s been far behind in public polling and, after in-person campaigning, has been shuttered since the emergence of the coronavirus and has had no public appearances besides Sunday night’s debate.With even some allies now admitting that Mr. Sanders’s path to the nomination has narrowed to a shut, only a shocking upset in at least one state has the potential to change the trajectory of the 2020 presidential race.Short of that, Mr. Sanders will be left in a state of suspended animation — far behind Mr. Biden in the delegate race with no upcoming primaries or caucuses to alter the state of the race, at least not until coronavirus concerns pass.Sanders is outspending Biden in ads. If the elections are successfully held, Mr. Biden is poised to do particularly well on Tuesday. All three states are places that Mr. Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.

With in-person campaigning frozen indefinitely by the virus, the importance of advertising and free news media coverage is most likely going to be of heightened importance going forward. With in-person campaigning frozen indefinitely by the virus, the importance of advertising and free news media coverage is most likely going to be of heightened importance going forward. A combined more than $21 million in television ads has been spent in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — and in every state, Mr. Sanders spent more than Mr. Biden and his supportive super PAC combined. The priciest state, by far, is Florida, where Mr. Sanders had poured nearly $6 million and Mr. Biden spent $5.3 million, despite polling in March that has shown Mr. Biden with a large lead in the state. Mr. Sanders is the bigger spender online, too.In the past seven days, Mr. Sanders has spent about $247,000 on Facebook ads in Illinois — nearly five times the $53,000 that Mr. Biden spent. It was a similar story across all four states, with Mr. Sanders ($106,000) far outpacing Mr. Biden (nearly $20,000) in Arizona and doubling him in Florida.Races to watch in Illinois.All eyes are on the presidential primary, of course, but there are also several important down-ballot races happening in Illinois today.The most closely watched is the primary in the Third Congressional District between Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Democrat, and Marie Newman, a progressive challenger. It is a second try for Ms. Newman, who is backed by the Justice Democrats and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York: She lost to Mr. Lipinski by just 2,000 votes in 2018.The primary will be an important test of whether someone like Mr. Lipinski, who opposes abortion and voted against the Affordable Care Act, is still welcome in the Democratic Party — and conversely, whether a candidate from the party’s progressive wing can win in a district that, while solidly Democratic, leans more conservative on social issues.Across the aisle, Republicans will be choosing their challengers against two first-term Democrats who flipped seats in 2018: Sean Casten in the Sixth District and Lauren Underwood in the 14th. And both parties are holding primary elections for an open seat in the 15th District, where Representative John Shimkus, a Republican, is retiring.We’ll also be keeping an eye on the state attorney’s race in Cook County, home to Chicago. It has been the most expensive such race in county history and pits the incumbent, Kim Foxx, against three challengers. The most well-funded of the three is Bill Conway, a former prosecutor.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing to ask Congress to infuse about $850 billion in additional stimulus to prop up the economy, which is facing a deep downturn as businesses shutter amid the coronavirus pandemic.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to pitch Republican senators on the administration’s request for additional fiscal firepower, the centerpiece of which is the payroll tax cut that President Trump has been calling for, according to people familiar with the plans. At a luncheon in the Capitol, Mr. Mnuchin is also expected to face questions from Republicans who are reluctant to embrace a narrower relief package the House passed last week that includes paid leave, unemployment insurance, free coronavirus testing and additional food and health care aid.Some Republican senators now want to wrap both emergency economic measures into one enormous package, which would give them more negotiating leverage on a final product, according to people involved in the discussions who insisted on anonymity to describe them.The Trump administration is also supporting a request for $50 billion in economic relief for the airline industry as part of the broader package. The industry’s lobbying group publicly made the request on Monday, asking for grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The administration is also considering ways to support the cruise ship industry.

The industry’s lobbying group publicly made the request on Monday, asking for grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The administration is also considering ways to support the cruise ship industry. Widespread travel restrictions are throttling both industries and are expected to be a major drag on global economic growth. Economists at Capital Economics predicted that tourism worldwide could be cut by 50 percent over the next six weeks, sapping in 0.7 percentage points from the world’s annual gross domestic product.The proposal is emerging amid a growing sense of urgency among lawmakers to step in with aggressive measures to stanch the economic pain wrought by the pandemic, and mounting anxiety that Congress is running out of time to do so. With public health officials counseling significant measures to slow the spread of coronavirus, and states and cities ordering businesses to close, limitations on travel and other restrictions on movement, it is not clear how long lawmakers will be able to continue gathering in Washington.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said on Tuesday that senators would not leave the capital before passing “significant and bold new steps, above and beyond what the House has passed, to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm.”Mr. Trump’s payroll tax cut has drawn opposition from members of both parties, and a growing chorus of Republicans and Democrats are calling instead for cash payments to Americans. Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, said this week that every adult American should receive a $1,000 check from the government to help boost spending in the economy. A group of Democratic senators, led by Michael Bennet of Colorado, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is pushing Congress to send as much as $4,500 to nearly every adult and child in the United States this year, as part of a sustained government income-support program to counter the economic slowdown.Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, laid out the administration’s fiscal stimulus approach on Monday and said that it would amount to about $800 billion, a figure that did not include relief for the airline industry.

Voters will be asked to wash their hands both before entering the precinct and after leaving it.Maggie Astor and Matt Stevens contributed reporting.","2020 Democratic Primary in Arizona, Florida and Illinois: What to Watch For",2020-03-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/march-17-democratic-primary.html,new_york_times
"Turnout is a question ahead of every election. It would be an understatement to say it is a more challenging question than usual ahead of Tuesday’s primaries, as voters head to the polls in Florida, Illinois and Arizona amid the coronavirus pandemic.Although it’s hard to forecast the impact of coronavirus on turnout, there are a few hard facts that, on balance, suggest it might have less of an effect than one might expect in Florida and Arizona. But Illinois might be somewhat more vulnerable to a decline in turnout. (On Monday, Ohio’s governor postponed the state’s primary over health concerns.)One factor is sure to blunt the effect of the coronavirus: early voting. Already, millions of voters in these states have cast their ballots either in person or by mail. Early voters are almost always older than the overall electorate, which tends to mitigate the possibility that such voters, who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus, won’t match their typical share of the vote.

Early voters are almost always older than the overall electorate, which tends to mitigate the possibility that such voters, who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus, won’t match their typical share of the vote. Historically, early voters represent an especially large share of the electorate in Arizona, which has a large list of permanent absentee voters. These voters in Arizona tend to be much older: Over all, 34 percent of registered Democrats who are permanent absentee voters are over 65, compared with 20 percent of registered Democrats who aren’t permanent absentees, according to data from L2, a nonpartisan political data firm.

In 2016, 81 percent of Democrats in Arizona cast their ballots ahead of the election. So far this year, the state has already received more Democratic ballots than it did four years ago. Alone, that’s enough to significantly insulate the state from the effects of the coronavirus.Florida also has extensive in-person and early voting. Nearly one million Democrats have already voted there, or about 55 percent of the total turnout from the 2016 Democratic primary. Early voters tend to be older in Florida as well. In 2016, of those between 18 and 24 who voted, 62 percent voted on Election Day. That’s compared with just 39 percent of voters over age 65 who did so, according to an analysis by Matthew Isbell, a Democratic political consultant in Florida.Illinois has below-average rates of absentee voting. Nearly 400,000 voters have cast ballots, but this tally includes both Democratic and Republican voters. It suggests that only around 10 percent of Democratic primary voters have cast ballots there, making the state much more susceptible to a decline in Election Day turnout. Another factor that might shape turnout is the number of known coronavirus cases. This could affect whether voters perceive a substantial risk in voting. None of these states have a particularly high rate of confirmed coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by The New York Times.

By this measure, Arizona again seems relatively insulated from suppressed turnout: The state currently has just 18 known cases, or 2.5 cases per million residents. Florida and Illinois, on the other hand, have somewhat higher numbers. There are 138 known cases in Florida, or 6.4 per million, and 95 in Illinois, or 7.5 cases per million. Both are still beneath the national average.

There, turnout was down by 20 percent from the last election in 2014. It was a significant decline in turnout, but perhaps not one that bodes especially poorly for the elections in the U.S. on Tuesday. After all, there are more than 83 cases per million French resident, or more than 10 times the rate of Illinois, and there is no substantial early voting.There is no reason to assume that American and French voters will respond to the coronavirus threat in the same way. But if they did, the turnout in today’s primaries would presumably remain relatively strong.If turnout did drop because of coronavirus, it’s hard to say which candidate would benefit. Older voters would seem likeliest to stay home. They face the greatest health risks from coronavirus, and older Democrats tend to be most concerned about it, according to data from Civiqs. A lower turnout among older voters would tend to hurt Joe Biden, who has won older voters by a wide margin.On the other hand, older voters are likeliest to have already voted, and they are the most reliable voters in general.

Confirmed cases tend to be concentrated in metropolitan areas, where Bernie Sanders has usually fared best in the contests since South Carolina. In Illinois, for instance, most cases are in Cook County, which includes Chicago and around half of Illinois Democrats. Cook County has 70 known coronavirus cases, or 13.4 per million residents. One could argue that turnout is likeliest to drop there, and that might be bad news for Mr. Sanders, who seems likely to get swept in the state’s rural areas and suburbs.Ultimately, even a significant coronavirus turnout effect would be unlikely to change the trajectory of the race. Mr. Biden leads by a wide margin in all three states, based on the polls and recent election results. If he wins by anything like the kind of margins suggested by the polls, he could end the night with an all but insurmountable lead in the pledged delegate count.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump, under pressure to take more significant steps to slow the spreading coronavirus, recommended on Monday that Americans stop unnecessary travel and avoid bars, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people, as he warned that the outbreak could extend well into the summer.The national guidelines, which also advise home-schooling and the curtailing of visits to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, are the most robust response so far from the Trump administration. But the guidelines, which officials described as a trial set, are not mandatory and fall short of a national quarantine and internal travel restrictions, which many health officials had urged.And they do not reflect the urgency of actions taken around the world as governments in Italy, France, Spain and elsewhere began imposing stringent lockdowns on citizens. Even within the United States, local governments were imposing shelter-at-home orders and police-enforced quarantine zones.“So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is much lower than the other way had we not done a good job,” Mr. Trump said, “but people are talking about July, August, something like that.” WASHINGTON — President Trump, under pressure to take more significant steps to slow the spreading coronavirus, recommended on Monday that Americans stop unnecessary travel and avoid bars, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people, as he warned that the outbreak could extend well into the summer.The national guidelines, which also advise home-schooling and the curtailing of visits to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, are the most robust response so far from the Trump administration.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the president assumed a more realistic tone than his weeks of casual optimism and hopes that the virus “will disappear.” He said discussions with governors and public health experts had prompted his administration to “further toughen” the guidelines to contain the virus.“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,” Mr. Trump said, “we will rally together as one nation, and we will defeat the virus, and we’re going to have a big celebration all together.”Mr. Trump made his announcement as much of the United States was disoriented by the abrupt closure of schools and businesses and the essential emptying of public life. The 2.1 million-strong work force of the federal government was struggling with a confusing patchwork of guidance on whether or not to work from home. Stock prices weathered another brutal day of trading, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 12 percent, and coronavirus infections in the country soared to well over 4,000 — and well over 181,000 globally.In Chicago, an employee in the Federal Aviation Administration office responsible for airlines at O’Hare International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing the agency to close an office that performs safety and maintenance inspections at one of the nation’s busiest airports.

Mr. Trump angered some governors on a conference call on Monday morning when he told them, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves.” In a recording shared with The New York Times, he was heard adding: “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” Mr. Trump angered some governors on a conference call on Monday morning when he told them, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves.” In a recording shared with The New York Times, he was heard adding: “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves.

The president’s guidelines appeared to be driven by a new report from London that predicted that without action to stem the spread, the virus could cause more than two million deaths in the United States, and the most effective way to reduce that is to limit interactions among people.“We are at a critical inflection point in this country, people,” Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, said on Fox News. “When you look at the projections, there’s every chance that we could be Italy,” where deaths have topped 2,100.A congressional stimulus package that could cushion the effects of the pandemic hit a snag as lawmakers from both chambers haggled over who could provide a better one.When asked by reporters if the country was headed for a recession, Mr. Trump remarked, “It may be.”“We’re thinking in terms of the virus,” the president said. “Once we stop — I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy. And once this goes away, once it goes through and we’re done with it, I think you’re going to see a tremendous, a tremendous surge.”Mr. Trump’s advisers were less sanguine.“We are going to be challenged, no question about it,” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic adviser, told reporters gathered in the White House driveway earlier on Monday. “We have a big challenge.” But such realism was the tone of the day.

The bill could include direct aid like loans or grants for industries such as the airlines. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called on Monday for Congress to approve loans and loan guarantees for large companies whose business has been disrupted by the virus.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said that any future legislation would help support families and bolster businesses and the health care system, indicating that he and his lieutenants would take a larger role in drafting another piece of legislation.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Tuesday that he wants Congress to quickly approve a sweeping economic stimulus package that would include sending checks directly to Americans within two weeks as large swaths of the economy shut down in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.“We want to go big,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House on Tuesday, adding that he has instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to pursue measures that would provide more immediate economic support over the payroll tax cut holiday that he had been promoting. The Trump administration is preparing to ask Congress to infuse about $850 billion in additional stimulus to prop up the economy. And while Mr. Trump had signaled he wanted the payroll tax to be the centerpiece, it faces bipartisan opposition in Congress, and on Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said time was of the essence.“We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I mean now, in the next two weeks.” WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Tuesday that he wants Congress to quickly approve a sweeping economic stimulus package that would include sending checks directly to Americans within two weeks as large swaths of the economy shut down in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.“We want to go big,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House on Tuesday, adding that he has instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to pursue measures that would provide more immediate economic support over the payroll tax cut holiday that he had been promoting.

The administration has been negotiating with lawmakers in the House and the Senate over the timeline and contents of a stimulus package. Mr. Mnuchin is expected to pitch Republican senators on the proposal at a lunch in the Capitol on Tuesday. He is also expected to face questions from Republicans who are reluctant to embrace a narrower relief package the House passed last week that includes paid leave, unemployment insurance, free coronavirus testing and additional food and health care aid.Some Republican senators now want to wrap both emergency economic measures into one enormous package, which would give them more negotiating leverage on a final product, according to people involved in the discussions who insisted on anonymity to describe them. At the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump instructed him to allow for the deferment of tax payments, interest free and penalty free for 90 days. People can defer up to a $1 million and corporations can defer up to $10 million in payments.

He added that people who can file their taxes now should do so, because many will get refundsThe Trump administration is also supporting a request for $50 billion in economic relief for the airline industry as part of the broader package. The industry’s lobbying group publicly made the request on Monday, asking for grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The administration is also considering ways to support the cruise ship industry.Widespread travel restrictions are throttling both industries and are expected to be a major drag on global economic growth. Economists at Capital Economics predicted that tourism worldwide could be cut by 50 percent over the next six weeks, sapping in 0.7 percentage points from the world’s annual gross domestic product.The proposal is emerging amid a growing sense of urgency among lawmakers to step in with aggressive measures to stanch the economic pain wrought by the pandemic, and mounting anxiety that Congress is running out of time to do so. With public health officials counseling significant measures to slow the spread of coronavirus, and states and cities ordering businesses to close, limitations on travel and other restrictions on movement, it is not clear how long lawmakers will be able to continue gathering in Washington.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said on Tuesday that senators would not leave the capital before passing “significant and bold new steps, above and beyond what the House has passed, to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm.”Mr. Trump’s payroll tax cut has drawn opposition from members of both parties, and a growing chorus of Republicans and Democrats are calling instead for cash payments to Americans. Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, said this week that every adult American should receive a $1,000 check from the government to help boost spending in the economy. A group of Democratic senators, led by Michael Bennet of Colorado, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is pushing Congress to send as much as $4,500 to nearly every adult and child in the United States this year, as part of a sustained government income-support program to counter the economic slowdown.The Senate has yet to act on the measure the House passed last week, which was the product of negotiations between Democrats and Mr. Mnuchin. The House on Monday substantially scaled back the scope of the paid leave provisions as part of an agreed-upon package that passed quietly without a vote.    The Treasury secretary said that this would inject $300 billion into the economy. He added that people who can file their taxes now should do so, because many will get refundsThe Trump administration is also supporting a request for $50 billion in economic relief for the airline industry as part of the broader package.

The original legislation offered 10 additional weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay for all workers impacted by the pandemic. Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, laid out the administration’s fiscal stimulus approach on Monday and said that it would amount to about $800 billion, a figure that did not include relief for the airline industry.Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Mnuchin are also considering an array of other proposals to help individuals and small and midsize businesses, which are facing cash flow problems. One of those ideas, according to people familiar with the discussions, would make it easier for businesses to restructure debt. Other ideas under consideration include providing more funding to hospitals and measures such as loan workouts to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.The Treasury secretary downplayed speculation that American markets could be closed because of the tremendous volatility, but said it was possible that hours could be shortened. “We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,” he said. “Americans need to know they have access to their money.”Jim Tankersley and Nick Fandos contributed reporting.

With in-person campaigning frozen indefinitely by the virus, the importance of advertising and free news media coverage is most likely going to be of heightened importance going forward.A combined more than $21 million in television ads has been spent in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — and in every state, Mr. Sanders spent more than Mr. Biden and his supportive super PAC combined. The priciest state, by far, is Florida, where Mr. Sanders had poured nearly $6 million and Mr. Biden spent $5.3 million, despite polling in March that has shown Mr. Biden with a large lead in the state. Mr. Sanders is the bigger spender online, too.In the past seven days, Mr. Sanders has spent about $247,000 on Facebook ads in Illinois — nearly five times the $53,000 that Mr. Biden spent. It was a similar story across all four states, with Mr. Sanders ($106,000) far outpacing Mr. Biden (nearly $20,000) in Arizona and doubling him in Florida.Races to watch in Illinois.All eyes are on the presidential primary, of course, but there are also several important down-ballot races happening in Illinois today.The most closely watched is the primary in the Third Congressional District between Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Democrat, and Marie Newman, a progressive challenger. It is a second try for Ms. Newman, who is backed by the Justice Democrats and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York: She lost to Mr. Lipinski by just 2,000 votes in 2018.The primary will be an important test of whether someone like Mr. Lipinski, who opposes abortion and voted against the Affordable Care Act, is still welcome in the Democratic Party — and conversely, whether a candidate from the party’s progressive wing can win in a district that, while solidly Democratic, leans more conservative on social issues.Across the aisle, Republicans will be choosing their challengers against two first-term Democrats who flipped seats in 2018: Sean Casten in the Sixth District and Lauren Underwood in the 14th. And both parties are holding primary elections for an open seat in the 15th District, where Representative John Shimkus, a Republican, is retiring.

We’ll also be keeping an eye on the state attorney’s race in Cook County, home to Chicago. It has been the most expensive such race in county history and pits the incumbent, Kim Foxx, against three challengers. The most well-funded of the three is Bill Conway, a former prosecutor.More than 300,000 absentee ballots have been cast in Arizona.More than 380,000 Democrats in Arizona have already cast their ballots in the primary. Like other states in the West, Arizona Democrats are a diverse group — with white voters making up about half of voters, while Latinos make up about 36 percent and black voters account for about 9 percent of all voters, according to an analysis by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.While Mr. Sanders has done well among Latino voters elsewhere in the West, a poll released by Univision late last week indicated Mr. Sanders held just a five-point lead ahead of Mr. Biden.In polling conducted earlier this month, voters indicated that their greatest concern was reducing health care costs, with roughly 60 percent saying they supported moving toward a system that “guarantees health care for everyone.”Though Arizona Democrats have said they expect a record number of voters to cast their ballots by mail, the outbreak of the pandemic has unquestionably changed the atmosphere — many voters have said they prefer Mr. Biden because of his experience. But the electorate is likely to split along ideological lines, with Mr. Sanders’s supporters saying that the current crisis underscores the need for “Medicare for All.”What’s turnout going to be like in Arizona?

Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, said this week that every adult American should receive a $1,000 check from the government to help boost spending in the economy. A group of Democratic senators, led by Michael Bennet of Colorado, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is pushing Congress to send as much as $4,500 to nearly every adult and child in the United States this year, as part of a sustained government income-support program to counter the economic slowdown.The Senate has yet to act on the measure the House passed last week, which was the product of negotiations between Democrats and Mr. Mnuchin. The House on Monday substantially scaled back the scope of the paid leave provisions as part of an agreed-upon package that passed quietly without a vote.Workers impacted by the pandemic — because they are ill, quarantined, caring for a family member, or lacked child care with schools closed — would still receive two weeks of sick leave. But health care providers or emergency responders could be excluded by the labor secretary. And any additional leave provided would be limited to workers with children whose schools or child care have been closed. The original legislation offered 10 additional weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay for all workers impacted by the pandemic.Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, laid out the administration’s fiscal stimulus approach on Monday and said that it would amount to about $800 billion, a figure that did not include relief for the airline industry.Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Mnuchin are also considering an array of other proposals to help individuals and small and midsize businesses, which are facing cash flow problems. One of those ideas, according to people familiar with the discussions, would make it easier for businesses to restructure debt. Other ideas under consideration include providing more funding to hospitals and measures such as loan workouts to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.The Treasury secretary downplayed speculation that American markets could be closed because of the tremendous volatility, but said it was possible that hours could be shortened.“We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,” he said. “Americans need to know they have access to their money.”Jim Tankersley and Nick Fandos contributed reporting.

With in-person campaigning frozen indefinitely by the virus, the importance of advertising and free news media coverage is most likely going to be of heightened importance going forward.A combined more than $21 million in television ads has been spent in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — and in every state, Mr. Sanders spent more than Mr. Biden and his supportive super PAC combined. The priciest state, by far, is Florida, where Mr. Sanders had poured nearly $6 million and Mr. Biden spent $5.3 million, despite polling in March that has shown Mr. Biden with a large lead in the state. Mr. Sanders is the bigger spender online, too.In the past seven days, Mr. Sanders has spent about $247,000 on Facebook ads in Illinois — nearly five times the $53,000 that Mr. Biden spent. It was a similar story across all four states, with Mr. Sanders ($106,000) far outpacing Mr. Biden (nearly $20,000) in Arizona and doubling him in Florida.Races to watch in Illinois.All eyes are on the presidential primary, of course, but there are also several important down-ballot races happening in Illinois today.The most closely watched is the primary in the Third Congressional District between Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Democrat, and Marie Newman, a progressive challenger. It is a second try for Ms. Newman, who is backed by the Justice Democrats and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York: She lost to Mr. Lipinski by just 2,000 votes in 2018.The primary will be an important test of whether someone like Mr. Lipinski, who opposes abortion and voted against the Affordable Care Act, is still welcome in the Democratic Party — and conversely, whether a candidate from the party’s progressive wing can win in a district that, while solidly Democratic, leans more conservative on social issues.Across the aisle, Republicans will be choosing their challengers against two first-term Democrats who flipped seats in 2018: Sean Casten in the Sixth District and Lauren Underwood in the 14th. And both parties are holding primary elections for an open seat in the 15th District, where Representative John Shimkus, a Republican, is retiring.

We’ll also be keeping an eye on the state attorney’s race in Cook County, home to Chicago. It has been the most expensive such race in county history and pits the incumbent, Kim Foxx, against three challengers. The most well-funded of the three is Bill Conway, a former prosecutor.More than 300,000 absentee ballots have been cast in Arizona.More than 380,000 Democrats in Arizona have already cast their ballots in the primary. Like other states in the West, Arizona Democrats are a diverse group — with white voters making up about half of voters, while Latinos make up about 36 percent and black voters account for about 9 percent of all voters, according to an analysis by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.While Mr. Sanders has done well among Latino voters elsewhere in the West, a poll released by Univision late last week indicated Mr. Sanders held just a five-point lead ahead of Mr. Biden.In polling conducted earlier this month, voters indicated that their greatest concern was reducing health care costs, with roughly 60 percent saying they supported moving toward a system that “guarantees health care for everyone.”Though Arizona Democrats have said they expect a record number of voters to cast their ballots by mail, the outbreak of the pandemic has unquestionably changed the atmosphere — many voters have said they prefer Mr. Biden because of his experience. But the electorate is likely to split along ideological lines, with Mr. Sanders’s supporters saying that the current crisis underscores the need for “Medicare for All.”Will young Sanders supporters show up on Tuesday?Mr. Sanders has attracted loyal support from his voters, who remain eager for him to push his agenda, particularly on Medicare for all and free public college. And Mr. Sanders took an aggressive tact in Sunday night’s debate, pressing on with his criticisms of Mr. Biden’s previous stances.Though in recent days, Mr. Biden has tried to adopt policies that would appeal to Mr. Sanders’s supporters, the two repeatedly sparred over policy differences on Sunday. As Mr. Biden appears poised to capture the Democratic nomination, it is unclear whether he will attract the support of Mr. Sanders’s most loyal supporters, particularly Latino and young voters.

The most well-funded of the three is Bill Conway, a former prosecutor.More than 300,000 absentee ballots have been cast in Arizona.More than 380,000 Democrats in Arizona have already cast their ballots in the primary. Like other states in the West, Arizona Democrats are a diverse group — with white voters making up about half of voters, while Latinos make up about 36 percent and black voters account for about 9 percent of all voters, according to an analysis by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.While Mr. Sanders has done well among Latino voters elsewhere in the West, a poll released by Univision late last week indicated Mr. Sanders held just a five-point lead ahead of Mr. Biden.In polling conducted earlier this month, voters indicated that their greatest concern was reducing health care costs, with roughly 60 percent saying they supported moving toward a system that “guarantees health care for everyone.”Though Arizona Democrats have said they expect a record number of voters to cast their ballots by mail, the outbreak of the pandemic has unquestionably changed the atmosphere — many voters have said they prefer Mr. Biden because of his experience. But the electorate is likely to split along ideological lines, with Mr. Sanders’s supporters saying that the current crisis underscores the need for “Medicare for All.”Will young Sanders supporters show up on Tuesday?Mr. Sanders has attracted loyal support from his voters, who remain eager for him to push his agenda, particularly on Medicare for all and free public college. And Mr. Sanders took an aggressive tact in Sunday night’s debate, pressing on with his criticisms of Mr. Biden’s previous stances.Though in recent days, Mr. Biden has tried to adopt policies that would appeal to Mr. Sanders’s supporters, the two repeatedly sparred over policy differences on Sunday. As Mr. Biden appears poised to capture the Democratic nomination, it is unclear whether he will attract the support of Mr. Sanders’s most loyal supporters, particularly Latino and young voters. But despite Mr. Sanders’s promise to expand the electorate, young people have not turned up in droves for him during the primary race.“Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?” Mr. Sanders said after losing on Super Tuesday early this month. “The answer is no.”Will those voters be any more inclined to show up amid the coronavirus pandemic?What’s turnout going to be like in Arizona?

Arizona offered several emergency early-voting options as the coronavirus pandemic escalated. Matt Grodsky, a party spokesman, said on Monday that early turnout alone might surpass the total turnout in the 2016 presidential primary race.Many counties — including Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and Mesa, and Pima County, which includes Tucson — are also offering curbside pickup outside precincts Tuesday so that voters can turn in their ballots without having to enter crowded polling sites.Officials said they had chosen not to postpone the primary in part because so many Arizonans vote early anyway.“Safety procedures have been put in place at every polling location,” Mr. Grodsky said. “We believe that delaying the election would cause undue chaos to this election process.”A video released by Gov. Doug Ducey and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said that those safety procedures included setting “regular intervals” for poll workers to wash their hands, and sanitizing voting equipment and other commonly touched surfaces. Voters will be asked to wash their hands both before entering the precinct and after leaving it.Maggie Astor and Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

"WASHINGTON — When it comes to the term bailout, lawmakers and Trump administration officials would just as soon bail out and avoid it altogether.

The bipartisan TARP, or Troubled Asset Relief Program, of 2008 was labeled a bank bailout and helped incite backlashes in the form of the conservative Tea Party and progressive Occupy Wall Street movements, demonstrating the power of federal rescue programs to anger voters at both ends of the ideological spectrum.Lawmakers now scrambling to bolster the economy in light of the coronavirus crisis don’t want to stir those kinds of resentments again.

Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a House panel that while “specific industries” might be in line for substantial government assistance, he did not want to apply any bothersome buzzword.“I want to be clear: This is not bailouts,” he said. “We are not looking for bailouts, but there may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel, that have issues with lending.” To many Americans, a bailout has come to signify the idea that some undeserving corporate entity that has preyed on the public and profited from doing so is getting taxpayer help while the taxpayer himself is not.

He noted that banks ultimately paid back the funds they were allocated in 2008.“A program where the government doesn’t lose money is difficult to describe as a bailout,” Mr. Bradley said. “It is a loaded term, and opponents use it indiscriminately to apply to things that don’t even meet the textbook definition.”Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former top aide to Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader during the 2008 debate over the financial rescue package, said the value of government relief was sometimes in the partisan eye of the beholder.“If you are a Democrat, assistance to families is much needed economic relief or an economic stimulus, and some will call aid to businesses a bailout,” Mr. Manley said. “If you are a Republican, aid to businesses will be much needed relief or a stimulus, and some will call aid to families wasteful spending.”The bank bailout came in the final months of the George W. Bush administration, though it is often associated with President Barack Obama, who took office in January 2009. It passed on bipartisan votes in both the House and Senate, though blocs of Republicans in both chambers opposed it.While its real political effect was in the future, it still became something of an issue in the 2008 election.

But he said that turnout at polling places was low. “What’s happening right now at the polls, it’s very slow,” Mr. Quinn said. “We’ll see if that picks up between 4 and 7 today.

But Primary Day turnout has not kept up the pace.“It’s off-year election kind of slow,” Mr. Bride said. He projected Peoria County’s turnout might reach about 17 percent of registered voters, down from 43 percent in 2016 when both parties had competitive presidential contests.In Florida’s Palm Beach County, hundreds of volunteer poll workers told officials they could not show up on Tuesday, forcing the county to open some locations late and move other ones. “Nobody’s voting,” Mr. Balanoff said. “They had a bigger than normal early voting and absentee voting, but it certainly looks like it’s going to be a really, really slow day.”Marty Quinn, a Chicago city alderman who represents a district on the city’s Southwest Side near Midway International Airport, pointed to record numbers of early and mail-in voters.

It’s the invisible enemy.”Yet Mr. Trump appeared to hedge on the severity of the crisis, saying the wartime power law was “a worst-case scenario in the future.” The president also continued to refer to the disease as the “Chinese virus,” brushing off questions about whether the phrase was racist.The prospect of escalating government intervention fell far short of reassuring investors. Markets erased Tuesday’s gains and plummeted to new lows, as reports of mass layoffs steadily reached Wall Street and Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler all said they would temporarily shutter their plants in the United States.The S&P 500 declined about 5 percent, wiping away nearly all of the gains made during Mr. Trump’s presidency on another day that saw an automatic 15-minute halt in trading to prevent a stock market crash. Oil prices and European stocks were also sharply down. And the New York Stock Exchange announced it would temporarily close its trading floor and move fully to electronic trading for the first time in its history after two people there tested positive for Covid-19. “Now it’s our time,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House. “We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together, and we will come through together. It’s the invisible enemy.”Yet Mr. Trump appeared to hedge on the severity of the crisis, saying the wartime power law was “a worst-case scenario in the future.” The president also continued to refer to the disease as the “Chinese virus,” brushing off questions about whether the phrase was racist.The prospect of escalating government intervention fell far short of reassuring investors.

Even as Mr. Trump unveiled his plan, it was not clear how quickly it could have an effect. Just hours after the president announced his order to dispatch two military hospital ships, a Pentagon spokesman said deployment would not be possible for at least two weeks because one of the ships, the Comfort, is currently undergoing repairs in Norfolk, Va. The other ship, the Mercy, will deploy sooner. Even as Mr. Trump unveiled his plan, it was not clear how quickly it could have an effect.

And when he invoked the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that authorizes the president to take extraordinary action to force American companies to help produce material — like respirators, ventilators and protective gear for health workers — needed for national security, Mr. Trump said,  “Hopefully there will be no need.”On Capitol Hill, Congress was racing to negotiate a swift agreement on the administration’s $1 trillion request and marry it with proposals flooding in from lawmakers, interest groups and industries. But with vast amounts of money on the line and bipartisan agreement necessary to pass anything into law, it was not clear how quickly the talks could proceed.With the memory of past bailouts fresh in their minds, lawmakers were toiling to ensure that any rescue plan would contain accountability measures for the businesses that received government aid.After days of delay, senators voted overwhelmingly to give final approval to a relief package passed last week by the House that would provide paid leave, enhanced unemployment benefits, free coronavirus testing as well as food and health care aid. The vote was 90 to 8, with two senators not voting because they were in quarantine after coming into contact with people infected by the novel coronavirus.Mr. Trump quickly signed the bill, which early estimates suggest could cost several hundreds of billions of dollars. But that emergency package — considered a mammoth response to the virus when it was initially drafted only a week ago — was already being eclipsed by the emerging $1 trillion stabilization plan as the damage wrought by the pandemic coursed throughout the global economy.

The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States shot past 8,000 by Wednesday evening, and deaths related to the disease rose to at least 143, fueled largely by an explosion of new cases in New York. Officials warned that the numbers would continue to rise as much-delayed testing ability ramped up in the coming days.For the first time, the legions of infected Americans included sitting members of Congress. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, and Representative Ben McAdams, Democrat of Utah, said in separate statements that they began experiencing symptoms on Saturday evening. Mr. Diaz-Balart, 58, who remained in Washington, and Mr. McAdams, 45, who had already returned to Utah, learned of their positive test results on Wednesday.Both men were on the House floor as recently as early Saturday morning voting on the virus relief bill with fellow members. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, issued a grim warning to the nation’s millennials, pleading with them from the White House briefing room to avoid large gatherings and to take the disease seriously amid new evidence that young people in Italy and France had become “very seriously ill” from it.Having moved on Tuesday to wall off the southwestern border, the president announced his agreement with Canada to do the same to the northern border. The decision effectively closed off the United States from the rest of the continent, as Mr. Trump’s government and those around the world sought to control the spread of the virus. Separately, the State Department said it would temporarily stop issuing visas to foreign travelers.Belgium became the latest country to lock down all but essential businesses. Italy, already ravaged by the pandemic, recorded its single deadliest day yet, with total fatalities connected to the virus approaching 3,000 and threatening to surpass China’s reported totals.

With many of its own members at elevated health risk from the virus and bracing for potential travel restrictions, the Senate may have only a handful of days to sign a deal before leaving town for what could be an extended recess. And though the House is not in session and has not scheduled a return to Washington, many of its members were ready to fly back if there were a deal.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said his party was coming close to an agreement with the White House and could begin talks as early as Thursday with Democrats, whose support would be needed to pass anything into law.“Republicans hope shortly to have a consolidated position along with the administration, then we intend to sit down with our Democratic colleagues to see what we can agree to,” he said Wednesday afternoon. “Just how long it will take to get through these steps is unclear, but as everyone knows, we are moving rapidly because the situation demands it.”In a conference call with Democratic leadership and committee chairmen on Wednesday afternoon, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was pushing for a bipartisan negotiation between House and Senate leaders that could yield a final agreement on the next economic rescue package by early next week.The Trump administration’s proposed relief package, outlined in a document circulated to lawmakers and lobbyists, called for the authority to send two waves of checks, each totaling $250 billion, directly to American taxpayers, the first on April 6 and the second on May 18. Payments would be fixed and their sizes dependent on income and family size, the summary said, in line with a proposal by Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri.It would extend loans to small businesses equaling six weeks of their payroll up to $1,540 per employee, on the condition that the companies must keep paying their employees for eight weeks after receiving the loan. It also called for $50 billion for secured loans for the airline industry and another $150 billion for secured loans or loan guarantees for other sectors of the economy that have been devastated by the global economic shutdown as the virus spreads.

Under the plan, the Exchange Stabilization Fund, an emergency reserve account that is usually used for intervening in currency markets, would cover the costs of the secured loans to airlines and other industry players. The fund would also temporarily be allowed to guarantee money market mutual funds.“We’re going to provide whatever economic aid we need to this economy,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNBC. “There are a lot of great companies that were great companies a month ago, they’re going to be great companies three months from now, six months from now — whatever it is.”Mr. McConnell has insisted the Senate will not leave town until it finishes the emergency stabilization package, but the desire for speed may not guarantee that talks go smoothly. Republican senators unhappy about various provisions of the smaller relief bill passed by the House last week are likely to continue to haggle over costs and specific details of anything the chamber puts together.Congress already passed an initial $8.3 billion package of funding for the government health agencies responding to the novel coronavirus, which Mr. Trump signed this month.On Tuesday night, the White House sent a new $45 billion request for agencies on the front lines. That request included an additional $8.3 billion for the Defense Department; $5.3 billion for the emergency preparedness and response agency at the Department of Health and Human Services; and $13.1 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover health care treatment costs, testing kits, temporary intensive care unit beds and personal protective equipment.Senate Democratic leaders have put forward their own $750 billion plan and would have to lend at least some support to any package for it to pass the Senate. “There are many things in this bill that are important, like no payment on student loans or mortgages, help with our mass transit systems — there are many things — and Democrats are going to fight for them in the next phase of response,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said of his proposal.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday defended his increasingly frequent practice of calling the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus,” ignoring a growing chorus of criticism that it is racist and anti-Chinese.“It’s not racist at all,” Mr. Trump said, explaining his rationale. “It comes from China, that’s why.”But the term has angered Chinese officials and a wide range of critics, and China experts say labeling the virus that way will only ratchet up tensions between the two countries, while resulting in the kind of xenophobia that American leaders should discourage. Asian-Americans have reported incidents of racial slurs and physical abuse because of the erroneous perception that China is the cause of the virus.“The use of this term is not only corrosive vis-à-vis a global audience, including here at home, it is also fueling a narrative in China about a broader American hatred and fear of not just the Chinese Communist Party but of China and Chinese people in general,” said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

At the White House briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was attaching “China” to the name of the virus to combat a disinformation campaign promoted by Beijing officials that the American military was the source of the outbreak.“I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them,” Mr. Trump said. “I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.”Then in two tweets on Wednesday morning, he pointedly referred to the “Chinese Virus.” When he was asked about the term during another appearance at the daily White House coronavirus briefing later in the day, he insisted that he was simply pointing out a fact: that the illness was first detected in China.Public health officials have tried to avoid names that might result in discriminatory behavior against places or ethnic groups since releasing more stringent guidelines for naming viruses in 2015. But after the briefing, the White House on Twitter criticized what it called “the media’s fake outrage,” pointing to other illnesses that had been named after places, including the Ebola virus and the West Nile virus.Mr. Kennedy said that past language used by Mr. Trump and his administration had eliminated any benefit of the doubt. “Given the Trump administration’s long record of statements and actions on immigration, immigrants and issues of race,” he said, “use of this term can’t but be interpreted as xenophobic and tinged with racist overtones.” At the White House briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was attaching “China” to the name of the virus to combat a disinformation campaign promoted by Beijing officials that the American military was the source of the outbreak.“I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them,” Mr. Trump said. “I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.”Then in two tweets on Wednesday morning, he pointedly referred to the “Chinese Virus.” When he was asked about the term during another appearance at the daily White House coronavirus briefing later in the day, he insisted that he was simply pointing out a fact: that the illness was first detected in China.Public health officials have tried to avoid names that might result in discriminatory behavior against places or ethnic groups since releasing more stringent guidelines for naming viruses in 2015.

And I think, in the end, that’s going to be — that will have saved a tremendous number of lives.”But Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Mr. Trump’s travel measures fell far short of a comprehensive approach that would include testing and quarantines, and overall were “too little, too late.”The virus most likely emerged in China in November or December, and it is clear that some travelers from China were already spreading the virus within the United States in January, before the restrictions went into place at the beginning of February, Mr. Huang said.Still, since the beginning of the outbreak, Mr. Trump and high-ranking administration officials have sought to pinpoint blame for the spread of the virus on China, and Beijing has responded in kind. The finger-pointing over which country has done less to contain the disease has caused tensions between the two nations almost daily.

On Tuesday, the Chinese government announced that it would be expelling journalists from major news outlets, including The New York Times, in a response to the Trump administration’s decision to limit the number of Chinese citizens working in the United States for five propaganda outlets.And last week, Zhao Lijian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, shared the conspiracy theory that the United States was behind the virus. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” he said on Twitter. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!”The darker turn in U.S.-China relations has spilled out into public spats and private mistrust. While both countries have said that the trade deal they signed in January remains on track, American officials have blamed China for mishandling the coronavirus epidemic, as well as for withholding exports of face masks and other protective medical equipment.And within the Trump administration, some officials who are China hawks have privately discussed a theory that the virus emerged not from a food market in Wuhan, as many news media reports have said, but from a nearby Chinese government laboratory, where virologists were carrying out research.That theory has been discussed on Fox News by Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, an ally of Mr. Trump’s.Charlie Woo, the chief executive of Megatoys and the public policy committee chairman of the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese-Americans, said the administration’s language was dividing the public during a national emergency.“This crisis requires science, facts and clear language, not fear-mongering, finger-pointing and xenophobia by our public servants,” Mr. Woo said in a statement. “We face a global pandemic that calls for a truly global, unified response. Attempts to ascribe the virus to one culture, ethnicity or country can only hinder this effort, alienating people who could instead collaborate and support one another.” On Tuesday, the Chinese government announced that it would be expelling journalists from major news outlets, including The New York Times, in a response to the Trump administration’s decision to limit the number of Chinese citizens working in the United States for five propaganda outlets.And last week, Zhao Lijian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, shared the conspiracy theory that the United States was behind the virus. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” he said on Twitter. “Be transparent!

Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said on Twitter that “I don’t understand why China gets upset bc we refer to the virus that originated there the ‘Chinese virus’ Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918&1919.”The phrase “Spanish flu” is itself a misnomer: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say experts are still not sure where the disease originated.The language has also extended to the president’s re-election effort. In a message emailed to supporters and posted on its website, the Trump-Pence 2020 campaign fueled the push to blame Beijing for the spread of the virus. It also accused former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner, of “siding with the Chinese.”“America is under attack — not just by an invisible virus, but by the Chinese,” said the campaign appeal, which was dated Wednesday.It added: “What is Joe Biden up to as all this is happening?

In a press briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo six times referred to the coronavirus as the “Wuhan virus,” after the city that was the epicenter of the virus in China.Even as he said that “now is not the time for recrimination,” Mr. Pompeo also again accused China of initially playing down the threat posed by what is now a pandemic.“We know this much: We know that the first government to be aware of the Wuhan virus was the Chinese government,” Mr. Pompeo said. “That imposes a special responsibility to raise the flag, to say: ‘We have a problem. This is different and unique and presents risk.’ And it took an awful long time for the world to become aware of this risk that was sitting there, residing inside of China.”“The Chinese Communist Party had a responsibility to do this — not only for Americans and Italians and South Koreans and Iranians who are now suffering, but for their own people as well,” Mr. Pompeo said.Mr. Pompeo said the expulsions were just the latest example of how China wants to “deny the world the capacity to know what’s really going on inside of their country.”Government officials in China have publicly cast doubt on whether the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, as health authorities believe.But a senior State Department official said on Wednesday that President Xi Jinping of China in early January repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the “Wuhan” illness, and that many Chinese citizens still do.Edward Wong contributed reporting.

"This was supposed to be the presidential primary race in which the progressive wing of the Democratic Party put it all together. The left was coming for power, not only moral victories. One popular podcast promised that the party’s moderates would soon “bend the knee,” as working Americans flocked to a left-wing presidential agenda.But after a disastrous month of electoral drubbings that continued with Tuesday’s primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, it has become clear that the presidential promises of political revolution and big structural change will once again have to wait.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is not just beating liberal rivals, all but vanquishing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and outlasting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. His candidacy has poked significant holes in the strategy of their wing of political thought.Their big investments in organizing could not overcome his name recognition. They could not reshape the primary electorate, while Mr. Biden has surged among more moderate voters in Democratic suburbs. They could not cut into his advantage with black voters. And they could not overcome his electability argument — that he is the best candidate to defeat President Trump — as evidenced by the fact that Mr. Biden bested Mr. Sanders with many liberal voters in Florida on Tuesday. This was supposed to be the presidential primary race in which the progressive wing of the Democratic Party put it all together. The left was coming for power, not only moral victories. One popular podcast promised that the party’s moderates would soon “bend the knee,” as working Americans flocked to a left-wing presidential agenda.But after a disastrous month of electoral drubbings that continued with Tuesday’s primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, it has become clear that the presidential promises of political revolution and big structural change will once again have to wait.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is not just beating liberal rivals, all but vanquishing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and outlasting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. His candidacy has poked significant holes in the strategy of their wing of political thought.Their big investments in organizing could not overcome his name recognition.

And they could not overcome his electability argument — that he is the best candidate to defeat President Trump — as evidenced by the fact that Mr. Biden bested Mr. Sanders with many liberal voters in Florida on Tuesday. Mr. Biden is also succeeding even as progressive policies such as single-payer health care, robust action on climate change and student debt cancellation continue to poll high among Democratic voters, drawing majority support in some states.This disconnect, in which policies are popular but the candidates who advocate them are losing, has frustrated progressive groups. They privately split blame among themselves, the candidates they backed and a Democratic electorate that has prioritized fear of losing to President Trump above all other concerns.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a leading progressive and a top surrogate for Mr. Sanders, said in an interview that her wing of the party needed to learn “political lessons” from this race.Asked for examples, she said that reaching suburban women and older black voters, groups progressive presidential candidates have struggled to win over, may require different political tactics.“There’s so much emphasis on making outreach as conflict-based as possible,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “And sometimes I even feel miscast and understood. Because it’s about what tools you use, and conflict is one tool but not the only tool.” Mr. Biden is also succeeding even as progressive policies such as single-payer health care, robust action on climate change and student debt cancellation continue to poll high among Democratic voters, drawing majority support in some states.This disconnect, in which policies are popular but the candidates who advocate them are losing, has frustrated progressive groups.

As Mr. Biden triumphed in Florida on Tuesday night, more than 70 percent of the state’s voters interviewed by AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate, said they favored replacing private health insurance with a “Medicare for all”-type system, the single-payer health care plan that has been the signature issue of Mr. Sanders’s campaign.

Exit polls in Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri and Washington, all of which had primaries last Tuesday, showed that the majority of Democrats in each state backed Medicare for all. Common Dreams, the progressive website, tallied 20 states in a row where voters said they supported Medicare for all over private insurance in exit polls. Still, Mr. Biden has cruised to victory in many of them.Matt Morrison, executive director of the labor organization Working America, said left-wing Democrats told themselves a faulty story — that winning the policy argument was the foremost way to build a political coalition. But doing so also requires building trust with voters, he said, because most Americans “look and ask, ‘Are they going to win over voters that aren’t like me or don’t care about politics?’”“The self-branded progressive wing has to go beyond just the policy that fits the needs of the community,” he added. “Voters see that clearly. They’re making judgments about the whole person.” Exit polls in Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri and Washington, all of which had primaries last Tuesday, showed that the majority of Democrats in each state backed Medicare for all.

I want it! But can it win?’”And it is not just that Mr. Biden is winning, but how Mr. Sanders is losing: The Vermont senator has not won a single county in Florida, Michigan, Mississippi or Missouri.The results are humbling for his allies, who entered the race oozing confidence.

When Ms. Warren was leading in polls and her policy ideas were dominating the conversation, they gloated that progressives did not have one presidential front-runner, but two.But early victories by Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire and Nevada would soon run into a moderate buzz saw.

I know what we have to do.”Sean McElwee, the co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress, said the left’s vulnerability was in some ways self-inflicted; since Mr. Sanders’s first presidential campaign in 2016, he said, progressives have not focused enough on persuading mainstream Democrats to support their cause.“By refusing to acknowledge persuasion, we leave ourselves out of part of the equation,” he said. “For progressives to have a seat at the table, we have to start speaking in the language that people are actually thinking in.”Mr. Sanders has yet to comment on Tuesday’s results, and his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said on Wednesday morning that the senator would be “having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.”It is a stark contrast to what progressive leaders were saying in May, when their message to those who warned of Mr. Biden’s durability was to wait and see.“This is what we’re going to test,” Mr. Shakir said at the time. “Where are people at?”Not, evidently, with Mr. Sanders. “Let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you” Mr. Biden said. “I know what’s at stake.

"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was reassessing the future of his presidential bid on Wednesday after a crushing round of primary losses left him with no realistic path to the Democratic nomination and the 2020 race itself was on hold because of the coronavirus outbreak.Mr. Sanders’s campaign has stopped actively advertising on Facebook, and his campaign manager sent an email to supporters without asking for donations — the kind of steps that sometimes precede the end of campaigns. His aides say Mr. Sanders is not suspending his bid, even as some Democrats have become increasingly vocal that he should consider leaving the race.The party’s front-runner, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has now amassed a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates needed to clinch the nomination after winning the Arizona, Florida and Illinois primaries on Tuesday. Mr. Biden has swept so many states and attracted so many demographic groups that Mr. Sanders has little left to go on besides his political message and his passionate base of liberal supporters.Some Democrats said that with the delegate outlook so bleak, and with a deadly pandemic gripping an anxious nation, Mr. Sanders risks appearing self-centered and out of step if he insists on pressing ahead.

Bloomberg. “The Democratic Party has moved within inches of his revolution on all major issues.”Yet  26 states, territories and the District of Columbia have yet to hold primaries and caucuses, and there are still 1,399 delegates left to be awarded. With the primary season essentially on hold because of public health concerns, it could be at least two months before Mr. Biden accumulates enough to secure the nomination. D.N.C. rules require a presidential nominee to accrue 1,991 delegates, and Mr. Biden cannot win those delegates if states don’t hold their primaries.But if Mr. Sanders does quit, Mr. Biden would be free to move on to focus on the general election, President Trump and the national challenges posed by the virus.Even among those who view Mr. Biden’s eventual triumph as inevitable, there is a belief that contested primaries are good for the party, generating enthusiasm and spurring turnout. In Wisconsin, Democratic officials worry that if Mr. Sanders drops out before the state’s planned April 7 primary, it could depress turnout and hurt liberal candidates for state and local offices.“There’s thousands of people on the ballot right now,” said Andrew Werthmann, a D.N.C. member from Eau Claire, Wis. “People should recognize that having contested primaries does help drive turnout and that helps all elections down the ballot.”Others in the party say that prodding Mr. Sanders to drop out now would deprive his loyalists of the right to show their support for him at the ballot box. And for the party’s left wing, having Mr. Sanders continue to run would enable them to win delegate slots at the national convention, which would provide leverage when it comes to shaping the party’s platform and writing rules for the next presidential nominating contest.  “It’s time to throw in the towel knowing that he has won the battle of issues,” said Wilbur Colom, a Democratic National Committee member from Mississippi who formerly supported Michael R.

But he has made it clear he will wait for the Vermont senator to approach him before playing a larger role, one former aide said.One of the most conspicuous Sanders boosters on Wednesday was Mr. Trump himself, who has regularly claimed that the Democratic establishment was trying to rig the system against Mr. Sanders — and whose campaign viewed Mr. Sanders as its preferred opponent.“The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters.” Officials close to Mr. Biden say they are sensitive to being perceived as pushing Mr. Sanders too hard. In a series of staff and surrogate calls over the past week, Biden aides have increasingly pressed for an approach in which Mr. Biden begins to ignore Mr. Sanders altogether and instead tries to turn the race into a two-man contest with Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the campaign’s strategy.Mr. Biden’s campaign also understands it is operating from a position of strength. On Wednesday it sent a memo to reporters that declared he had an “increasingly clear” path to the nomination and saying the 2020 primary race “is nowhere near as close as the 2008 and 2016 Democratic primaries.” The two campaigns have been communicating, however. Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said in a statement on Wednesday that “since last week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns have been in regular contact at a senior level to discuss how the coronavirus is affecting the campaigns, how to adjust schedules and activities in light of that — as well as to discuss both Vice President Biden’s and Senator Sanders’s ideas on policy responses to the virus.” Former President Barack Obama, who is close to Mr. Biden,  has grown increasingly anxious over the difficulties of incorporating the Sanders wing of the party into the Biden coalition, according to former aides and associates.

But they also see no real downside in sticking it out, pointing to the uncertainty surrounding the primaries because of the coronavirus.Mr. Sanders also views the crisis as a moment when the progressive agenda he has championed for years is especially vital, and he is eager to leverage his influence at a time when issues like health care and economic inequity are so resonant, some allies say.  On Tuesday night before most polls closed, he released a list of proposals to deal with the crisis, including that Medicare cover all medical bills and that $2,000 cash payments be provided to every American each month.  He has indicated he plans to speak with Democratic leadership about the plans he has proposed.

"WASHINGTON — The outbreak of the respiratory virus began in China and was quickly spread around the world by air travelers, who ran high fevers. In the United States, it was first detected in Chicago, and 47 days later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. By then it was too late: 110 million Americans were expected to become ill, leading to 7.7 million hospitalized and 586,000 dead. WASHINGTON — The outbreak of the respiratory virus began in China and was quickly spread around the world by air travelers, who ran high fevers. In the United States, it was first detected in Chicago, and 47 days later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. By then it was too late: 110 million Americans were expected to become ill, leading to 7.7 million hospitalized and 586,000 dead. That scenario, code-named “Crimson Contagion” and imagining an influenza pandemic, was simulated by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services in a series of exercises that ran from last January to August.The simulation’s sobering results — contained in a draft report dated October 2019 that has not previously been reported — drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed.

Cities and states went their own ways on school closings.Many of the potentially deadly consequences of a failure to address the shortcomings are now playing out in all-too-real fashion across the country. And it was hardly the first warning for the nation’s leaders. Three times over the past four years the U.S. government, across two administrations, had grappled in depth with what a pandemic would look like, identifying likely shortcomings and in some cases recommending specific action.In 2016, the Obama administration produced a comprehensive report on the lessons learned by the government from battling Ebola. In January 2017, outgoing Obama administration officials ran an extensive exercise on responding to a pandemic for incoming senior officials of the Trump administration.The full story of the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus is still playing out. Government officials, health professionals, journalists and historians will spend years looking back on the muddled messages and missed opportunities of the past three months, as President Trump moved from dismissing the coronavirus as a few cases that would soon be “under control” to his revisionist announcement on Monday that he had known all along that a pandemic was on the way.

What the scenario makes clear, however, is that his own administration had already modeled a similar pandemic and understood its potential trajectory.

The White House defended its record, saying it responded to the 2019 exercise with an executive order to improve the availability and quality of flu vaccines, and that it moved early this year to increase funding for the Department of Health and Human Services’ program that focuses on global pandemic threats.“Any suggestion that President Trump did not take the threat of COVID-19 seriously is false,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.But officials have declined to say why the administration was so slow to roll out broad testing or to move faster, as the simulations all indicated it should, to urge social distancing and school closings.Asked at his news briefing on Thursday about the government’s preparedness, Mr. Trump responded: “Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before.”The work done over the past five years, however, demonstrates that the government had considerable knowledge about the risks of a pandemic and accurately predicted the very types of problems Mr. Trump is now scrambling belatedly to address.Crimson Contagion, the exercise conducted last year in Washington and 12 states including New York and Illinois, showed that federal agencies under Mr. Trump continued the Obama-era effort to think ahead about a pandemic.

But the planning and thinking happened many layers down in the bureaucracy.

Bush administration, homeland security and health officials focused on big gaps in the American response to a biological attacks and the growing risk of pandemics. The first test came in April 2009, just a few months after the start of President Barack Obama’s first term. A 10-year-old California girl was diagnosed with a contagious disease that would be called swine flu or H1N1, the first flu pandemic in more than 40 years.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that ultimately there were about 60.8 million cases in the United States, along with 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths associated with H1N1.The virus turned out to be less deadly than first expected. But it was a warning shot that officials in the Obama administration said they took seriously, kicking off a planning effort that escalated in early 2014, with the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and ensuing fear that it could spread to the United States.

But it was a warning shot that officials in the Obama administration said they took seriously, kicking off a planning effort that escalated in early 2014, with the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and ensuing fear that it could spread to the United States. Ebola was less contagious than the flu, but far more deadly. It killed 11,000 people in Africa. But it could have been far worse. The United States sent nearly 3,000 troops to Africa to help keep the disease from spreading. While the containment effort was considered a success, inside the White House, officials sensed that the United States had gotten lucky — and that the response had revealed gaps in preparedness.Christopher Kirchhoff, a national security aide who moved from the Pentagon to the White House to deal with the Ebola crisis, was given the job of putting together a “lessons learned” report, with input from across the government.The weaknesses Mr. Kirchhoff identified were early warning signals of what has unfolded in the past three months.His report concluded that the United States assumed more ability on the part of the World Health Organization than the agency actually had.The United States had its own issues. There was no airplane in the U.S. fleet capable of evacuating an American doctor who was infected while treating patients in Liberia. The Pentagon was largely unprepared for the intervention that Mr. Obama ordered.While the United States rapidly developed a way to screen air passengers coming into the country — borrowing from intelligence tools developed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to track possible terrorists — Mr. Kirchhoff found deficiencies in even measuring how fast the virus was spreading.

On the plus side, the Obama White House had created an Ebola Task Force, run by Ron Klain, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s former chief of staff, before a single case emerged in the United States. Congress allocated $5.4 billion in emergency funding to pay for Ebola treatment and prevention efforts in the United States and West Africa.The money helped fund a little-known agency inside the Department of Health and Human Services in charge of preparing for future contagious disease outbreaks, the same office that in 2019 ran the Crimson Contagion exercise and other similar events in the years since.After a man named Thomas Duncan, a Liberian citizen, became the first person given a diagnosis of Ebola on American territory in September 2014, errors resulted in the infection of two nurses and fear of a wider spread in the United States. (Mr. Duncan died, but the two nurses recovered.)What is striking in reading Mr. Kirchhoff’s account today, however, is how few of the major faults he found in the American response resulted in action — even though the report was filled with department-by-department recommendations.There were deficiencies “in personal protective equipment use, disinfection” and “social services for those placed under quarantine.”There was confusion over travel restrictions, and the need “for a smoother sliding scale of escalation of government response, from local authorities acting on their own to local authorities acting with some federal assistance” to the full activation of the federal government.The report concluded that “a minimum planning benchmark might be an epidemic an order of magnitude or two more difficult than that presented by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, with much more significant domestic spread.” On the plus side, the Obama White House had created an Ebola Task Force, run by Ron Klain, Vice President Joseph R.

Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state; John F. Kelly, designated to become homeland security secretary; and Rick Perry, who would become energy secretary — gaming out the response to a deadly flu outbreak.She asked Tom Bossert, who was preparing to come in as Mr. Trump’s homeland security adviser, to run the event alongside her.“We modeled a new strain of flu in the exercise precisely because it’s so communicable,” Ms. Monaco said. “There is no vaccine, and you would get issues like nursing homes being particularly vulnerable, shortages of ventilators.”Ms. Monaco was impressed by how seriously Mr. Bossert, her successor, appeared to take the threat, as did many of the 30 or so Trump team members who participated in the exercise, details of which were reported by Politico.

But by the time the current crisis hit, almost all of the leaders at the table — Mr. Tillerson, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Perry among them — had been fired or moved on.In 2018, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at the time, John R. Bolton, ousted Mr. Bossert and eliminated the National Security Council directorate, folding it into an office dedicated to weapons of mass destruction in what Trump officials called a logical consolidation.Asked about that shift on March 13, Mr. Trump told a reporter that it was “a nasty question,” before adding: “I don’t know anything about it.” Writing on Twitter the next day, Mr. Bolton lashed out at critics who said the shift had reflected disinterest in pandemic threats.“Claims that streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation’s bio defense are false,” Mr. Bolton tweeted. “Global health remained a top NSC priority.”In a statement, the National Security Council said it “has directors and staff whose full-time job it is to monitor, plan for, and respond to pandemics, including an infectious disease epidemiologist and a virologist.”But in testimony to Congress last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, suggested that ending the stand-alone directorate was ill-advised. “It would be nice if the office was still there,” he said.On Feb. 10, nearly three weeks after the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in the United States, Mr. Trump submitted a 2021 budget proposal that called for a $693.3 million reduction in funding for the C.D.C., or about 9 percent, although there was a modest increase for the division that combats global pandemics.

They included the Pentagon, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Security Council. Groups like the American Red Cross and American Nurses Association were invited to join, as were health insurance companies and major hospitals like the Mayo Clinic.The war game-like exercise was overseen by Robert P. Kadlec, a former Air Force physician who has spent decades focused on biodefense issues. After stints on the Bush administration’s Homeland Security Council and the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he was appointed assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for Preparedness and Response.“He recognized early that we have a big problem and we needed much bigger budgets to prepare,” said Richard Danzig, the secretary of the Navy in the Clinton administration, who had worked with Mr. Kadlec.The exercise played out in four separate stages, starting in January 2019.The events were supposedly unspooling in real time — with the worst-case scenario underway as of Aug. 13, 2019 — when, according to the script, 12,100 cases had already been reported in the United States, with the largest number in Chicago, which had 1,400.The fictional outbreak involved a pandemic flu, which the Department of Health and Human Services says was “very different than the novel coronavirus.” The staged outbreak had started when a group of 35 tourists visiting China were infected and then flew home to Australia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Thailand, Britain and Spain, as well as to the United States, with some developing respiratory symptoms and fevers en route.A 52-year-old man from Chicago, who was on the tour, had “low energy and a dry cough” upon his return home. His 17-year-old son on that same day went out to a large public event in Chicago, and the chain of illnesses in the United States started.

Many of the moments during the tabletop exercise are now chillingly familiar.In the fictional pandemic, as the virus spread quickly across the United States, the C.D.C. issued guidelines for social distancing, and many employees were told to work from home.But federal and state officials struggled to identify which employees were essential and what equipment was needed to effectively work from home.There also was confusion over how to handle school children. The C.D.C. recommended that states delay school openings — the exercise took place toward the end of the summer. But some school districts decided to go ahead with the start of school while others followed the federal advice, causing the same types of confusion and discrepancies that have marked the response to the coronavirus.The exercise from last year then went on to predict how the situation on the ground in the United States would worsen as the weeks passed.Confusion emerged as state governments began to turn in large numbers to Washington for help to address shortages of antiviral medications, personal protective equipment and ventilators. Then states started to submit requests to different branches of the federal government, leading to bureaucratic chaos.Friction also emerged between the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is traditionally in charge of disaster response, and the Department of Health and Human Services, another scenario playing out now.But the problems were larger than bureaucratic snags. The United States, the organizers realized, did not have the means to quickly manufacture more essential medical equipment, supplies or medicines, including antiviral medications, needles, syringes, N95 respirators and ventilators, the agency concluded.

At the White House, President Trump said he would be open to having the government take equity stakes in companies that require federal help, a move that would be unpopular with shareholders and would give the government more oversight over businesses. But he also injected new uncertainty into the government’s response, suggesting it was not his responsibility to meet the needs of health care workers on the front lines of combating the disease. A day after he said he would use the Defense Production Act — a Korean War-era law that allows presidents to force American industry to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies — Mr. Trump told reporters that he would rather rely on states to deliver equipment to health care workers.“The federal government’s not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping,” Mr. Trump said. “You know, we’re not a shipping clerk,” he said, adding that governors “are supposed to be doing it.”On Capitol Hill, Republicans presented a bill that would offer bridge loans of up to $10 million each to small businesses, extend hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to large corporations in distressed industries and send checks as large as $1,200 per adult to individuals earning less than $99,000 per year. The payments would phase in for earners up to $75,000 — meaning lower earners would get smaller checks — and then phase out again at $99,000. Those who did not earn enough to pay income tax would receive much less: $600.The proposal is different from one pitched on Thursday by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who said the administration wanted to send two waves of $1,000 checks to every American, one in April and one in May should the crisis persist.The Senate bill also includes a raft of temporary changes to the tax code that would reduce the tax liability of large corporations, many of them overriding provisions in the 2017 tax overhaul that were meant to raise revenue to offset corporate rate cuts.

It would place new limits on a paid-leave program that Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law this week, shielding small business owners from any costs of paid leave for workers affected by the virus — and limiting how much pay those workers could receive if they are forced to stay home.A preliminary estimate by the Tax Foundation in Washington shows that the bill would cost at least $1 trillion. The small-business loans alone would be $300 billion, according to documents circulated on Thursday by Senate Republicans.Mr. McConnell called for negotiations to begin with Senate Democrats on Friday, adding that Mr. Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Eric M. Ueland, the administration’s director of legislative affairs, would join them on behalf of the administration. It would place new limits on a paid-leave program that Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law this week, shielding small business owners from any costs of paid leave for workers affected by the virus — and limiting how much pay those workers could receive if they are forced to stay home.A preliminary estimate by the Tax Foundation in Washington shows that the bill would cost at least $1 trillion.

But little more than an hour after its release, the top House and Senate Democrats indicated that the legislation did not meet their standards.“We are beginning to review Senator McConnell’s proposal, and on first reading, it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a joint statement.Calling the legislation a “significant next step,” Mr. McConnell vowed that the Senate would not leave until the rescue package had been approved, and said there could be a possible fourth relief package to follow as Congress seeks to address an extraordinary series of events.

But several of the Republican proposals are likely to be nonstarters for Democrats in both chambers, whose support is needed in order for the package to become law.“Hopefully each side will give,” said Mr. Schumer of New York, the minority leader, speaking minutes after Mr. McConnell introduced the proposal. “We’ll come up with a good plan, we’ll send it to the president, and we will help to begin the long path to eradicate this awful virus.”House Democrats, scattered across the country during an indefinite recess, have also been exchanging their own proposals over conference calls from their districts. Ms. Pelosi, who has spoken repeatedly with Mr. Mnuchin in recent days, has said her committee leaders were discussing the possibility of expanding unemployment insurance eligibility, refundable tax credits and funds for small businesses to ensure that workers continue to be paid.One of the sticking points for members of both parties was the scope of the direct payment program, with some Republican senators pushing to strengthen unemployment insurance and loans for small businesses.“Direct payments make sense when the economy is beginning to restart — it makes no sense now because it’s just money,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters. “What I want is income, not one check. I want you to get a check you can count on every week, not one week.”Others said it should be structured so that the lowest earners got the most help — not the other way around.“Relief to families in this emergency shouldn’t be regressive,” Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said in a tweet. “Lower-income families shouldn’t be penalized.” But several of the Republican proposals are likely to be nonstarters for Democrats in both chambers, whose support is needed in order for the package to become law.“Hopefully each side will give,” said Mr. Schumer of New York, the minority leader, speaking minutes after Mr. McConnell introduced the proposal. “We’ll come up with a good plan, we’ll send it to the president, and we will help to begin the long path to eradicate this awful virus.”House Democrats, scattered across the country during an indefinite recess, have also been exchanging their own proposals over conference calls from their districts.

During a private conference call on Thursday, they debated where to set the income cap on individuals who could receive government checks, according to three people familiar with the discussion who insisted on anonymity to describe the private call.Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which would have some jurisdiction over the issue, suggested capping the direct payments to individuals with incomes between $50,000 and $75,000, according to two people familiar with the discussion. Other lawmakers advocated raising the limit to individual incomes of $130,000, while others suggested universal payments.

Representative Nita M.

Analysts at J.P. Morgan said this week that the United States economy could contract by 14 percent in the second quarter of this year.The Treasury Department has not released updated economic projections, but Mr. Mnuchin said that he expected the beginnings of growth again in the third quarter and a “gigantic” rebound in the final three months of the year.

The best pick is the woman Joe or Bernie trusts the most to be president and commander-in-chief.” “I’ve been predicting a woman on the ticket since 2017 and demanding it since Warren dropped out,” said Christine Pelosi, a D.N.C. member from San Francisco who is the daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “It’s really important to have the ability to lead America in the depression we will enter if we don’t flatten the curve and find a cure. The best pick is the woman Joe or Bernie trusts the most to be president and commander-in-chief.” Some of the party’s most liberal members and supporters of Mr. Sanders suggested that choosing Ms. Warren, a fellow liberal, would help Mr. Biden appeal to the progressive and young voters who have backed the Vermont senator in the primary. Choosing a moderate like Ms. Klobuchar, they say, would dampen general election enthusiasm.“Whoever ends up the nominee should pick Senator Warren,” said Tefere Gebre, a D.N.C. member from Maryland who is executive vice president of the AFL-CIO. “I would be less enthusiastic if it’s the senator from Minnesota.”Yet, with the coronavirus upending every part of American society, including the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden may be forced to deviate from the standard playbook.Mr. Biden’s running mate pick will be viewed through the lens of a public health and economic crisis, perhaps raising the stock of candidates who have more experience, or pushing him to consider someone from outside of government.“You could imagine some highly successful person from a different walk of life being considered, and that could expand the list a lot,” said John Podesta, who as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman was involved in her vice-presidential search. “A college president or a medical professional, somebody who would send a pretty powerful signal that what you care about is strength, performance, a commitment to facts and sound decision-making.”Mr. Biden’s campaign said it was beginning to build a team to conduct a “vigorous vetting process.” Some close to the campaign say the team is in the early stages of compiling a list of potential running mates and then will vet them. Beyond his own experience as Barack Obama’s vice president, Mr. Biden has a deep bench of aides to consult.

By late July, the list had been narrowed to five men, after the one woman under serious consideration, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, declined the campaign’s invitation to be vetted. (Mr. Romney eventually chose Representative Paul Ryan.)Donald Trump’s 2016 vetting process was less streamlined, but among those he interviewed during his search was Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa.Mrs. Clinton started with a list of 40 possible candidates, which was narrowed to nine who underwent a process of serious vetting, an interview and a campaign appearance with the candidate. While she considered a number of women to be vice president, only Ms. Warren advanced to the final stages of the process.For Mr. Biden, 77, a much younger woman could assuage concerns about his age and critiques about a primary process that started with the most diverse field in history and ended with two white men.Mr. Biden’s campaign hopes the early announcement that he would select a woman will give his operation a shot of enthusiasm from voters, even as the presidential election heads into a deep freeze because of the coronavirus. On Thursday, his campaign sent a fund-raising appeal asking supporters to “commit to standing with” Mr. Biden and his future female running mate.By announcing he will pick a woman, Mr. Biden is aiming to give his ticket a modern-day balance in a party focused on issues of racial and gender representation. Past nominees have chosen running mates who provided geographic diversity (Lloyd Bentsen in 1988) or offered the promise of winning a key state (Mr. Ryan, from Wisconsin, in 2012). Mr. Obama, just four years into his Senate term, chose Mr. Biden in 2008 to ease concerns about his own relative lack of experience and help appeal to white working-class voters.Choosing Ms. Harris, 55, would not only provide not a gender balance but also would add a black woman to the ticket after black voters helped revive Mr. Biden’s campaign in February.

Veterans of past vice-presidential searches said the most important elements have been how comfortable the nominees are with their would-be partners.And while past campaigns spent months vetting candidates and agonizing over running-mate strategy, there’s very little academic research suggesting that the vice-presidential pick has a huge impact on winning the general election.“The first and most important criteria is, can this person help you win in November and will they at least not hurt you in November,” said Mr. Podesta.For Mrs. Clinton, that meant ruling out candidates from states with Republican governors, like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. If she won, her team feared that Mr. Brown could be replaced in the Senate by a Republican and shift the balance of the chamber away from her future administration.Unlike any nominee since Mr. Gore, Mr. Biden has a unique view into the selection process, having gone through it himself. While Mr. Obama started with a list of 20 candidates, he faced pressure to select Mrs. Clinton as his running mate and create a “unity ticket.” After Mr. Obama rejected that idea, the choice came down to a “coin toss” between Mr. Biden and Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana.

This virus has been in our community a while now without us knowing.” She shared that her husband had been misdiagnosed with the flu, and that this would be “a long recovery.” She said that because he was in quarantine, “I cannot even be there for him to help him get through this.”Crises are political only until they are personal. As news of Mr. Frilot’s diagnosis spread, among his friends and on Nola.com, his story was no longer just that of a young, healthy person who caught a virus that young, healthy people had been told they were not supposed to catch. It was a revelation for the conservative suburbs of New Orleans, where many had written off the pandemic as liberal fear-mongering. Mr. Frilot, a registered Republican, and his family are generally apolitical, and were not thinking much about the virus — whether as a fiction or anything else — before he got sick. But many in their community had opinions on it from the start. By March 8, a Sunday, his temperature was 101.9. The flu, urgent-care doctors in Kenner told him.Wednesday night, and the fever had worsened. “I just couldn’t break it,” Ms. Frilot said, remembering how she alternated between Tylenol and Advil, just as the doctor prescribed. She found her husband sitting on the edge of the bathtub, wrapped in a towel, talking to himself.Thursday morning, emergency room. Thursday night, ICU. Friday morning, intubation.

But many in their community had opinions on it from the start. The language they used was the language politicians and media figures were also using. On March 8, when Mr. Frilot first went to urgent care, President Trump retweeted a joke from his White House social media director about Nero fiddling as Rome burned. The next night, Sean Hannity said on his prime time Fox News show that the virus was the media’s attempt to “bludgeon” Mr. Trump with “this new hoax.”After Ms. Frilot shared her husband’s experience, she saw social-media musings about the virus as a liberal plot to tank the stock market come to a halt, toilet-paper jokes no longer rack up likes. Several people have called her “to pass on to me that everyone has been awakened,” Ms. Frilot said. “Because everyone knows Mark.”Comments of disbelief, sorrow, promises of prayers rolled in almost immediately. A friend urged her to share her story more widely. Ms. Frilot was normally intensely private, but wasn’t that the point? That nothing was normal anymore? She made the post public.

Cheryl Pitfield, 61, a close friend and former co-worker of Ms. Frilot’s in the oil and gas industry, remembered reading it for the first time. “I just got chills,” she said. For Ms. Pitfield, before seeing her friend’s post, it didn’t seem as if there was a face to the virus. “Now there is.”She quickly sent a screenshot to friends in a group chat. “Oh my gosh,” Ms. Pitfield summed up the reaction, “this is real.”Ms. Pitfield lives in Metairie, about 10 minutes from Kenner. Like many in the area, which is represented in Congress by House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, she is a supporter of President Trump. She, and many of her friends, she said, believed that the coronavirus was a political stunt and media-induced hysteria.

Reading about Mr. Frilot, she added, put it into perspective for her.On Facebook, Kathy Perilloux shared a similar conversion.

She was asked to wear a mask. The mood was tense, chaotic, and she remembers the way the doctors and nurses looked at him.

"WASHINGTON — The outbreak of the respiratory virus began in China and was quickly spread around the world by air travelers, who ran high fevers. In the United States, it was first detected in Chicago, and 47 days later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. By then it was too late: 110 million Americans were expected to become ill, leading to 7.7 million hospitalized and 586,000 dead.

By then it was too late: 110 million Americans were expected to become ill, leading to 7.7 million hospitalized and 586,000 dead. That scenario, code-named “Crimson Contagion” and imagining an influenza pandemic, was simulated by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services in a series of exercises that ran from last January to August.The simulation’s sobering results — contained in a draft report dated October 2019 that has not previously been reported — drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed.

In January 2017, outgoing Obama administration officials ran an extensive exercise on responding to a pandemic for incoming senior officials of the Trump administration.The full story of the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus is still playing out. Government officials, health professionals, journalists and historians will spend years looking back on the muddled messages and missed opportunities of the past three months, as President Trump moved from dismissing the coronavirus as a few cases that would soon be “under control” to his revisionist announcement on Monday that he had known all along that a pandemic was on the way.

The White House defended its record, saying it responded to the 2019 exercise with an executive order to improve the availability and quality of flu vaccines, and that it moved early this year to increase funding for the Department of Health and Human Services’ program that focuses on global pandemic threats.“Any suggestion that President Trump did not take the threat of COVID-19 seriously is false,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.But officials have declined to say why the administration was so slow to roll out broad testing or to move faster, as the simulations all indicated it should, to urge social distancing and school closings.Asked at his news briefing on Thursday about the government’s preparedness, Mr. Trump responded: “Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before.”The work done over the past five years, however, demonstrates that the government had considerable knowledge about the risks of a pandemic and accurately predicted the very types of problems Mr. Trump is now scrambling belatedly to address.Crimson Contagion, the exercise conducted last year in Washington and 12 states including New York and Illinois, showed that federal agencies under Mr. Trump continued the Obama-era effort to think ahead about a pandemic.

Bush administration, homeland security and health officials focused on big gaps in the American response to a biological attacks and the growing risk of pandemics. The first test came in April 2009, just a few months after the start of President Barack Obama’s first term. A 10-year-old California girl was diagnosed with a contagious disease that would be called swine flu or H1N1, the first flu pandemic in more than 40 years.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that ultimately there were about 60.8 million cases in the United States, along with 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths associated with H1N1.The virus turned out to be less deadly than first expected. But it was a warning shot that officials in the Obama administration said they took seriously, kicking off a planning effort that escalated in early 2014, with the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and ensuing fear that it could spread to the United States.

But it was a warning shot that officials in the Obama administration said they took seriously, kicking off a planning effort that escalated in early 2014, with the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and ensuing fear that it could spread to the United States. Ebola was less contagious than the flu, but far more deadly. It killed 11,000 people in Africa. But it could have been far worse. The United States sent nearly 3,000 troops to Africa to help keep the disease from spreading. While the containment effort was considered a success, inside the White House, officials sensed that the United States had gotten lucky — and that the response had revealed gaps in preparedness.Christopher Kirchhoff, a national security aide who moved from the Pentagon to the White House to deal with the Ebola crisis, was given the job of putting together a “lessons learned” report, with input from across the government.The weaknesses Mr. Kirchhoff identified were early warning signals of what has unfolded in the past three months.His report concluded that the United States assumed more ability on the part of the World Health Organization than the agency actually had.The United States had its own issues. There was no airplane in the U.S. fleet capable of evacuating an American doctor who was infected while treating patients in Liberia. The Pentagon was largely unprepared for the intervention that Mr. Obama ordered.While the United States rapidly developed a way to screen air passengers coming into the country — borrowing from intelligence tools developed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to track possible terrorists — Mr. Kirchhoff found deficiencies in even measuring how fast the virus was spreading.

On the plus side, the Obama White House had created an Ebola Task Force, run by Ron Klain, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s former chief of staff, before a single case emerged in the United States. Congress allocated $5.4 billion in emergency funding to pay for Ebola treatment and prevention efforts in the United States and West Africa.The money helped fund a little-known agency inside the Department of Health and Human Services in charge of preparing for future contagious disease outbreaks, the same office that in 2019 ran the Crimson Contagion exercise and other similar events in the years since.After a man named Thomas Duncan, a Liberian citizen, became the first person given a diagnosis of Ebola on American territory in September 2014, errors resulted in the infection of two nurses and fear of a wider spread in the United States. (Mr. Duncan died, but the two nurses recovered.)What is striking in reading Mr. Kirchhoff’s account today, however, is how few of the major faults he found in the American response resulted in action — even though the report was filled with department-by-department recommendations.There were deficiencies “in personal protective equipment use, disinfection” and “social services for those placed under quarantine.”There was confusion over travel restrictions, and the need “for a smoother sliding scale of escalation of government response, from local authorities acting on their own to local authorities acting with some federal assistance” to the full activation of the federal government.The report concluded that “a minimum planning benchmark might be an epidemic an order of magnitude or two more difficult than that presented by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, with much more significant domestic spread.” On the plus side, the Obama White House had created an Ebola Task Force, run by Ron Klain, Vice President Joseph R.

(Mr. Duncan died, but the two nurses recovered.)What is striking in reading Mr. Kirchhoff’s account today, however, is how few of the major faults he found in the American response resulted in action — even though the report was filled with department-by-department recommendations.There were deficiencies “in personal protective equipment use, disinfection” and “social services for those placed under quarantine.”There was confusion over travel restrictions, and the need “for a smoother sliding scale of escalation of government response, from local authorities acting on their own to local authorities acting with some federal assistance” to the full activation of the federal government.The report concluded that “a minimum planning benchmark might be an epidemic an order of magnitude or two more difficult than that presented by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, with much more significant domestic spread.” But one big change did come out of the study: The creation of a dedicated office at the National Security Council to coordinate responses and raise the alarm early.“What I learned most is that we had to stand up a global biosecurity and health directorate, and get it enshrined for the next administration,” said Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s homeland security adviser.Getting the Trump Team’s Attention But one big change did come out of the study: The creation of a dedicated office at the National Security Council to coordinate responses and raise the alarm early.“What I learned most is that we had to stand up a global biosecurity and health directorate, and get it enshrined for the next administration,” said Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s homeland security adviser.Getting the Trump Team’s Attention After Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Monaco arranged an extensive exercise for high-level incoming officials — including Rex W. Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state; John F. Kelly, designated to become homeland security secretary; and Rick Perry, who would become energy secretary — gaming out the response to a deadly flu outbreak.She asked Tom Bossert, who was preparing to come in as Mr. Trump’s homeland security adviser, to run the event alongside her.“We modeled a new strain of flu in the exercise precisely because it’s so communicable,” Ms. Monaco said. “There is no vaccine, and you would get issues like nursing homes being particularly vulnerable, shortages of ventilators.”Ms. Monaco was impressed by how seriously Mr. Bossert, her successor, appeared to take the threat, as did many of the 30 or so Trump team members who participated in the exercise, details of which were reported by Politico.

But by the time the current crisis hit, almost all of the leaders at the table — Mr. Tillerson, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Perry among them — had been fired or moved on.In 2018, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at the time, John R. Bolton, ousted Mr. Bossert and eliminated the National Security Council directorate, folding it into an office dedicated to weapons of mass destruction in what Trump officials called a logical consolidation.Asked about that shift on March 13, Mr. Trump told a reporter that it was “a nasty question,” before adding: “I don’t know anything about it.” Writing on Twitter the next day, Mr. Bolton lashed out at critics who said the shift had reflected disregard for pandemic threats.“Claims that streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation’s bio defense are false,” Mr. Bolton tweeted. “Global health remained a top NSC priority.”In a statement, the National Security Council said it “has directors and staff whose full-time job it is to monitor, plan for, and respond to pandemics, including an infectious disease epidemiologist and a virologist.”But in testimony to Congress last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, suggested that ending the stand-alone directorate was ill-advised. “It would be nice if the office was still there,” he said.On Feb. 10, nearly three weeks after the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in the United States, Mr. Trump submitted a 2021 budget proposal that called for a $693.3 million reduction in funding for the C.D.C., or about 9 percent, although there was a modest increase for the division that combats global pandemics.

They included the Pentagon, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Security Council. Groups like the American Red Cross and American Nurses Association were invited to join, as were health insurance companies and major hospitals like the Mayo Clinic.The war game-like exercise was overseen by Robert P. Kadlec, a former Air Force physician who has spent decades focused on biodefense issues. After stints on the Bush administration’s Homeland Security Council and the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he was appointed assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for Preparedness and Response.“He recognized early that we have a big problem and we needed much bigger budgets to prepare,” said Richard Danzig, the secretary of the Navy in the Clinton administration, who had worked with Mr. Kadlec.The exercise played out in four separate stages, starting in January 2019.The events were supposedly unspooling in real time — with the worst-case scenario underway as of Aug. 13, 2019 — when, according to the script, 12,100 cases had already been reported in the United States, with the largest number in Chicago, which had 1,400.The fictional outbreak involved a pandemic flu, which the Department of Health and Human Services says was “very different than the novel coronavirus.” The staged outbreak had started when a group of 35 tourists visiting China were infected and then flew home to Australia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Thailand, Britain and Spain, as well as to the United States, with some developing respiratory symptoms and fevers en route.A 52-year-old man from Chicago, who was on the tour, had “low energy and a dry cough” upon his return home. His 17-year-old son on that same day went out to a large public event in Chicago, and the chain of illnesses in the United States started.

Many of the moments during the tabletop exercise are now chillingly familiar.In the fictional pandemic, as the virus spread quickly across the United States, the C.D.C. issued guidelines for social distancing, and many employees were told to work from home.But federal and state officials struggled to identify which employees were essential and what equipment was needed to effectively work from home.There also was confusion over how to handle school children. The C.D.C. recommended that states delay school openings — the exercise took place toward the end of the summer. But some school districts decided to go ahead with the start of school while others followed the federal advice, causing the same types of confusion and discrepancies that have marked the response to the coronavirus.The exercise from last year then went on to predict how the situation on the ground in the United States would worsen as the weeks passed.Confusion emerged as state governments began to turn in large numbers to Washington for help to address shortages of antiviral medications, personal protective equipment and ventilators. Then states started to submit requests to different branches of the federal government, leading to bureaucratic chaos.Friction also emerged between the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is traditionally in charge of disaster response, and the Department of Health and Human Services, another scenario playing out now.But the problems were larger than bureaucratic snags. The United States, the organizers realized, did not have the means to quickly manufacture more essential medical equipment, supplies or medicines, including antiviral medications, needles, syringes, N95 respirators and ventilators, the agency concluded.

You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they’re making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference.”Mr. Burr has long pushed for the United States to better prepare for the threat presented by pandemics, including sponsoring legislation that Congress passed in 2006 called the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act.“His message has always been, and continues to be, that we must be prepared to protect American lives in the event of a pandemic or bio-attack,” Caitlin Carroll, a spokeswoman for Mr. Burr, said in a statement. “Since early February, whether in constituent meetings or open hearings, he has worked to educate the public about the tools and resources our government has to confront the spread of coronavirus.”In a series of posts on Twitter, Mr. Burr accused NPR of twisting his comments into a “tabloid-style hit piece.” He argued that the report made him look duplicitous for sharing information at a publicly advertised event that was consistent with the message members of the Trump administration were then trying to promulgate.

Those sales include as much as $150,000 worth of stock in two hotel chains, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Extended Stay America. The values of both companies have declined significantly in recent weeks.

Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma; and Kelly Loeffler, Republican of Georgia.The record of Mr. Burr’s stock transaction shows he and his wife sold 33 different stocks on Feb. 13 that were collectively worth $628,000 to $1.7 million, according to the disclosures filed with the secretary of the Senate. Those sales include as much as $150,000 worth of stock in two hotel chains, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Extended Stay America. The values of both companies have declined significantly in recent weeks. He also sold as much as $65,000 worth of stock in Park Hotels & Resorts.Ms. Feinstein and her husband sold $1.5 million to $6 million worth of stock in Allogene Therapeutics, a California-based biotech company, in transactions that took place on Jan. 31 and Feb. 18.Mr. Inhofe sold a large amount of stock — all on Jan. 27 — including holdings in PayPal, Apple and Brookfield Asset Management, a real estate company, with the overall value of the sales totaling as much as $400,000, a disclosure report shows.Ms. Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey C. Sprecher, who is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, reported 27 stock sales worth millions of dollars starting on Jan. 24. On that day, Ms. Loeffler tweeted about attending the Senate briefing on the coronavirus. The stocks the couple sold were in companies including Exxon Mobil, Ross Stores and AutoZone. As the Intelligence Committee chairman, Mr. Burr receives regular briefings on threats to the United States, including the coronavirus. He is also a member of the Senate health committee, which in January hosted a briefing with top Trump administration officials open to all senators.It is apparently not the first time Mr. Burr has acted decisively to shield his assets from financial turmoil after hearing from government officials.

Loeffler does not make investment decisions for her portfolio,” the statement said. “Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisers without her or her husband’s knowledge or involvement.”The sales by Ms. Loeffler were initially reported by The Daily Beast.A spokesman for Ms. Feinstein said that she played no role in the decision to sell the stock. “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust,” a spokesman, Tom Mentzer, said in a statement. “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.”In a statement on Friday, Mr. Inhofe said he had not attended the Jan. 24 briefing and does not have “any involvement” in his investment decisions. He said that when he became chairman of the Armed Services Committee in late 2018, he had instructed his financial adviser to begin selling off all equities in favor of mutual funds and that the January sales were a part of that transition.Congress began requiring its members to disclose their stock sales in 2012, when it passed a law called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, which was intended to prevent lawmakers from using inside information to profit. The forms do not require lawmakers to record their actual earnings from those sales, just a range of the value of each transaction.Details of Mr. Burr’s stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and the Center for Responsive Politics, which maintains a database of congressional stock transactions. “Appreciate today’s briefing from the President’s top health officials on the novel coronavirus outbreak,” she wrote about the briefing. “These men and women are working around the clock to keep our country safe and healthy.”Ms. Loeffler’s office issued a statement early on Friday that said she did not even know the trades had taken place until weeks after they were made.“Sen.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers have resisted calls from congressional Democrats and a growing number of governors to use a federal law that would mobilize industry and provide badly needed resources against the coronavirus spread, days after the president said he would consider using that authority.Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about the Defense Production Act since he first said on Wednesday that he was prepared to invoke the law, which was passed by Congress at the outset of the Korean War and grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.The next day, he suggested that obtaining medical equipment should be up to individual governors because “we’re not a shipping clerk.” But on Friday, he reversed himself, asserting that he had used the law to spur the production of “millions of masks,” without offering evidence or specifics about who was manufacturing them or when they would reach health workers.And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that he was left with the impression after talking with Mr. Trump that he had decided to move to put the act into effect. He said “a commitment on the phone was a good start,” but that the president now needed to push the government “to move full steam ahead.” WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers have resisted calls from congressional Democrats and a growing number of governors to use a federal law that would mobilize industry and provide badly needed resources against the coronavirus spread, days after the president said he would consider using that authority.Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about the Defense Production Act since he first said on Wednesday that he was prepared to invoke the law, which was passed by Congress at the outset of the Korean War and grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.The next day, he suggested that obtaining medical equipment should be up to individual governors because “we’re not a shipping clerk.” But on Friday, he reversed himself, asserting that he had used the law to spur the production of “millions of masks,” without offering evidence or specifics about who was manufacturing them or when they would reach health workers.And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that he was left with the impression after talking with Mr. Trump that he had decided to move to put the act into effect. He said “a commitment on the phone was a good start,” but that the president now needed to push the government “to move full steam ahead.” But Mr. Trump’s confusing statements played out in the middle of a growing health crisis that within days has abruptly and indefinitely altered the course of American life.With the number of coronavirus cases in the United States surging above 17,000 — over 40 percent of those concentrated in New York — front-line health care workers have reported a dire shortage of masks, surgical gowns and eye gear to protect them from the virus. State lawmakers have also implored the president to help them get the supplies they need.Business leaders have said invoking the defense law is not necessary. During his appearance with the members of his coronavirus task force on Friday, Mr. Trump supported that idea and said that private companies, including General Motors, had volunteered to produce supplies without any prompting from the government.“We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work and help our country,” Mr. Trump said. “We have not had a problem with that at all.”Some of the president’s advisers have privately said that they share the longstanding opposition of conservatives to government intervention and oppose using the law, and the president again signaled his own ambivalence about it.

It is a big step. I am not sure if it is done before. When we need something, we’ll use it.”Asked Friday night about specific ways the Defense Production Act has been used, the White House said in a statement that the president was “currently using it to drive the private sector’s response to this crisis,” and that he had invoked the act “to ensure that the necessary authorities will be available to prioritize production of items under government contracts and to allocate scarce items where they are needed most.”In signing the executive order on Wednesday to put the act into effect, Mr. Trump said the purpose was to expedite distribution of “health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of Covid-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators,” and that Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, could order production and distribution of supplies, if necessary.But the president did not say if masks and ventilators in anything near the necessary quantity have actually been delivered to the workers who need them.During Friday’s briefing, Mr. Trump grew increasingly confrontational with reporters as they pressed him on the details of the Defense Production Act, and he snapped at Peter Alexander, a reporter for NBC News, who asked him what he would say to Americans who were scared.“I say that you’re a terrible reporter, that’s what I say,” Mr. Trump replied.“It is a bad signal that you are putting out to the American people,” the president continued. “You want to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism. Let’s see if it works. I happen to feel good about it. Who knows. I have been right a lot. Let’s see what happens.”As the coronavirus has spread, Mr. Trump has come under withering attack from Democrats for the speed at which he has mobilized the government to respond. “When we need something, we’ll order something,” Mr. Trump said of the act. “As you know two days ago, I invoked the act.

Kristi Noem, Republican of South Dakota, grew frustrated as she expressed to the president and members of the coronavirus task force that state officials had been working unsuccessfully with private suppliers.“I need to understand how you’re triaging supplies,” Ms. Noem said. “We, for two weeks, were requesting reagents for our public health lab from C.D.C., who pushed us to private suppliers who kept canceling orders on us. And we kept making requests, placing orders.”She added, “I don’t want to be less of a priority because we’re a smaller state or less populated.”Mr. Trump promised her that would “never” happen before Ms. Noem’s telephone line was disconnected.When it was originally passed, the Defense Production Act granted President Harry S. Truman the power to spur the production of aluminum, titanium and other needed materials during wartime. Since then, it has been used for both the prevention of terrorism and to prepare for natural disasters. “We’re talking about a president who is basically doing what Herbert Hoover did at the beginning of the Depression and minimizing the danger and refusing to use available federal action,” Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said Friday in an interview with the radio station WNYC. “And people are going to die, and they shouldn’t, they don’t have to, if we could get the support that we’re asking for.”Republicans have not been openly critical, but some governors have been explicit in describing their difficulties in depending on the private sector for medical supplies.In a call held on Thursday with Mr. Trump, a group of governors stressed to him that they were struggling to address the staggering demand for equipment.At one point, Gov.

The act would give the Trump administration the authority to override companies’ existing contracts and to direct supplies to hot spots like New York City or Seattle. It could also help mobilize funds for retooling factories, refitting pharmacy drive-throughs into testing sites and ramping up production of an eventual vaccine.But John Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that corporate executives were already working “hand in glove” with the government on production challenges.“American companies will do whatever it takes to support our country’s response to the pandemic and shore up the economy,” he said. “The Defense Production Act was designed for defense industry products with a single supplier, often with purely domestic production chains, and invoking it may do more harm than good in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.”Companies that manufacture face masks, medical wipes and other supplies say they are already operating around the clock to meet elevated demand. Some factories that make similar products — like surgical gowns, diapers and incontinence products — have already switched over to manufacture the face masks or other protective gear that health care workers need.But people familiar with the administration’s actions say it is still trying to figure out how industry supply chains operate, which companies could produce additional products and what kinds of subsidies it may need to offer.And without the Defense Production Act, the government will lack the ability to channel these supplies to areas that need it most — or to persuade companies to act quickly and without regard for their profits.As reported cases of the virus in the United States have soared, Mr. Trump, who is known to recruit input from a variety of outside advisers, has been getting conflicting advice. The proliferating number of private sector voices with direct access to the president and his top advisers — notably his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner — has resulted in a chaotic process.

The process is being rushed, with legislation being written in private and rushed toward votes without much scrutiny of the fine print. Both parties are under intense pressure to deliver for key constituencies.“The only industry that hasn’t been slowed down by the virus is the lobbying industry,” said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California.In an interview, Mr. Khanna said lobbyists have been “inundating people on the Hill with emails, calls and texts.”“It really provides a lens into the part of Washington that most Americans despise,” he continued, “particularly at this time of national crisis.”Some congressional aides have privately likened the lobbying blitz around the stimulus legislation to a gold rush.

Americans For Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the political network led by the billionaire Charles G.

I am emailing to 1) reinforce Reebok/adidas support; and 2) to ask: have you heard from anyone else on this?”Congressional analysts have previously estimated the proposed tax break would cost the government about $3.5 billion in lost tax revenue over 10 years.Gregory S. Walden, an official with the drone industry trade association, the Small UAV Coalition, did not entirely dismiss the idea that his group was being opportunistic in calling on the Trump administration to waive the regulations it opposes.

Many restaurant owners, facing lengthy closures, are laying off their staffs and are fearful of their survival if the crisis goes on for an extended period.“The challenge for us is that there are people who are using this crisis as a way to revisit past legislative battles that have nothing to do with coronavirus or the people suffering from it,” Mr. Kennedy said. “It’s offensive to the American people.”He said more than 40 state governments have ordered restaurants to be closed or drastically limited in service, which could lead to the elimination of 5 to 7 million jobs over the next three months. The $325 billion in assistance his group is seeking includes $145 billion to help cover operations and pay employees. “If you’re opportunistic in helping people, that’s the right kind of opportunism,” said Mr. Walden, a former chief counsel of the Federal Aviation Administration.But Sean Kennedy, an executive at the National Restaurant Association, said the flurry of lobbying in recent weeks has complicated the efforts of groups like his seeking Washington’s support to prop up struggling industries.

Those sessions, including an update on Feb. 12, were focused on the readiness of the United States for a potential epidemic, but also touched on the possible economic fallout. The next day, Feb. 13, Mr. Burr sold off 33 different stock holdings, worth a collective $628,000 to $1.7 million, liquidating a large share of his portfolio.Mr. Burr’s sale of the shares in the weeks before the market plunged over concerns about the economic impact of the virus at a time when Mr. Trump and other Republican officials were playing down the threat is now coming under intense scrutiny. It has also raised questions about whether he avoided losses by trading on inside information as Americans are looking to Washington for help in a severe crisis.At least four other senators, as well as about two dozen House lawmakers, also sold some of their financial holdings in the same period. Like Mr. Burr, the other senators said they did nothing wrong and were not acting on information unavailable to the general public.The stock sale ignited a political firestorm from both the left and the right, as calls immediately emerged for the resignation of Mr. Burr, who overnight found himself battling to avoid becoming the symbol of a financially advantaged elite at a populist moment.Under pressure to explain himself, Mr. Burr on Friday said that he had asked the Senate Ethics Committee to scrutinize the sales in an attempt to clear his name.

The four other senators — Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, Kelly Loeffler, Republican of Georgia, and David Perdue, Republican of Georgia — have each rejected any suggestion that they played any role in the stock sales, saying their portfolios are managed by others and they were perhaps not even aware the securities were being sold.But Mr. Burr has not disputed that he was involved in the decision, nor that it was motivated by a fear that markets in the United States were about to decline. He said on Friday that his decision had been based “solely on public news reports” out of Asia, largely from CNBC.The matter may be difficult to untangle. As a member of both the Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee and the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr was frequently briefed by national security and health officials on threats to the United States, including potential pandemics like the coronavirus. In the case of the Intelligence Committee, much of that information was classified.Legislation called the STOCK Act enacted in 2012 prohibits lawmakers and staff members from using nonpublic information to buy or sell stocks, with both criminal and civil penalties for violations. But the law left questions about how “nonpublic” is defined.Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer who advises members of Congress and candidates and who is a Republican, said the actions by Mr. Burr at a minimum needed to be examined.

He boasted to a North Carolina radio station at the time that he was one of three “brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn’t be doing this.”Publicly available disclosures show that the stock sales by Mr. Burr and his wife included as much as $150,000 in stock in two hotel chains, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Extended Stay America. The stock value of both companies has declined rapidly in recent weeks.As of 2018, the period covered by his most recent financial disclosure report, Mr. Burr had a net worth of about $1.7 million, making him the 154th wealthiest member of Congress, out of the 530 examined by Roll Call in an annual report on lawmakers and their assets.This means his sale on Feb. 13 represented a large share of his wealth; other than his stock portfolio, his assets consisted of real estate in Winston-Salem and Nags Head, N.C., and various bank accounts worth at least $802,000.It was not the first time that Mr. Burr had moved suddenly to protect his wealth.In 2008, after he heard the Treasury secretary at the time, Henry M. Paulson, talk about challenges banks were facing — as the nation was entering a recession — he called his wife and told her to withdraw as much cash as possible from their bank accounts, Mr. Burr told supporters during a speech in North Carolina.“I want you to go to the A.T.M., and I want you to draw out everything it will let you take,” Mr. Burr said, according to an account in The Hendersonville Times-News and The Hill newspaper. “I don’t know whether there is a violation, but it is certainly the type of facts that motivated the passage of the STOCK Act in the first place, and they are certainly the type of facts that warrant an investigation,” Mr. Sanderson said.Mr. Burr was one of only three senators to vote against the legislation, calling the law unnecessary because insider trading is already banned by other laws.

Mr. Burr trades relatively often on his holdings, filing 17 different “periodic transaction reports” last year, which are required when lawmakers buy or sell a stock. But most of these other transactions involved just a couple of purchases or sales, instead of a comprehensive and sudden sale of most of his holdings.The Feb. 13 stock sales by Mr. Burr came a week after he wrote an opinion article for Fox News suggesting that the United States was “better prepared than ever before” to confront the virus, in part because of legislation he had sponsored more than a decade ago called the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act intended to help prepare for such a threat.But Mr. Burr was clearly worried about the threat presented by the coronavirus. He told a group of North Carolina residents gathered last month at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington that the effect would be severe.“There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything we have seen in recent history,” Mr. Burr said, according to a recording obtained by NPR, which reported on his remarks on Thursday.Though as Intelligence Committee chairman he is entitled to additional one-on-one sessions with intelligence officials beyond what other senators hear, Mr. Burr does not appear to have requested any, according to two of the people familiar with the committee’s work, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.Sessions organized by the health committee that Mr. Burr attended were not classified and largely rehashed publicly available information about the virus, according to Senate aides involved. They were intended to prepare senators for the possibility that they might need to help draft a response if and when the virus arrived in the United States.The four other senators each also made significant stock sales between late January and late February at a time when senators were regularly briefed on the virus’s spread. Three of them — Ms. Loeffler, Mr. Perdue and Mr. Inhofe — said that they employed outside financial advisers to buy and sell stocks without their consultation and only learned about the sales after they were completed. Ms. Feinstein said the holdings were controlled by her husband or in a blind trust.

"Michael R. Bloomberg on Friday abandoned plans to form a new super PAC for the presidential race and employ his campaign organizers through November, instead opting to give $18 million to the Democratic National Committee for the party’s battleground states program and disband the army of field workers he had assembled across the country.The reversal — which came on the same day that election authorities reported he had spent more than $900 million on his campaign — prompted an outcry from former staff members, who said it was particularly startling for Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign to shatter their expectations of employment and health benefits in the middle of a major public-health crisis.“I’m so sorry I worked for this guy. I thought he was totally different,” said Jane Conrad, a former field organizer for Mr. Bloomberg in Minnesota whom the campaign recruited away from her work as a union field representative in February. “He took me out of my job for his own gain.”Mr. Bloomberg’s presidential campaign had promised at its outset that it would finance a field program through the November election, attracting staff members like Ms. Conrad with generous pay and benefits.

He transferred $18 million from his campaign account to the D.N.C., which intends to use the funds to hire its own organizing staff in battleground states.“While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the president accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,” the Bloomberg campaign wrote in an unsigned memo.The Bloomberg campaign had already paid rents through November for dozens of field offices in states expected to be competitive in the general election. Those offices will be transferred to Democratic state parties, which D.N.C. officials said would hire organizers using the money from Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign. The Bloomberg memo said the D.N.C. staffing would draw “in part from our own incredibly experienced and talented organizing staff.”In a conference call Friday, about 1,500 former campaign staff members across the country — including some who had been laid off earlier in the month — were informed of the plans by the campaign’s states director and encouraged to apply to work for the D.N.C., though they were advised that, should they be hired, those jobs would carry different pay and benefits.A set of interview talking points used by the campaign to hire field organizers over the last several months, seen by The New York Times, had included mention of “full health, dental and vision benefits” and “employment through November 2020 with Team Bloomberg.” In the end, Mr. Bloomberg, a multibillionaire, chose to do none of those things.

Employees were encouraged to reapply to work for Mr. Bloomberg’s organization in six battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.But on Friday, campaign employees in those states learned that they would not be working through the general election either. The Bloomberg campaign circulated a new survey to employees, inviting them to add their names to a list that would be forwarded to the D.N.C. for potential hiring. The deadline to fill it out was March 25.There was no promise of a job. Applicants would “be fed into the competitive hiring process,” the message said.“I spent all that time talking to people in my district, telling them we were going to be there through November — that was hammered into us over and over again,” said Dallas Johnson, who began working as an organizer in Minnesota for Mr. Bloomberg in January. “For the people who got let go today, there are other things they could have been doing,” he said, adding they had “pretty much zero job prospects of getting hired right now.”Ms. Conrad, who took a leave of absence to join the campaign last month, said Friday that she would be unable to reclaim her job as a labor union representative before the end of the year.She expressed particular concern about losing health care at the end of the month in the face of the coronavirus outbreak.“I was looking to get ahead and pay off medical bills,” said Ms. Conrad, whose son has Crohn’s disease and takes immunosuppressant drugs. “Now I’m looking at falling further behind on them.” Those verbal promises were first tested on March 9, less than a week after Mr. Bloomberg exited the race, when many field organizers were laid off and told they would be paid through the end of the month. Employees were encouraged to reapply to work for Mr. Bloomberg’s organization in six battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.But on Friday, campaign employees in those states learned that they would not be working through the general election either.

Nearly a dozen other former campaign workers expressed frustration in interviews on Friday, saying the pay and promises of job security through November had been key reasons they joined Mr. Bloomberg’s long-shot campaign. They requested anonymity to speak because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed with the campaign and a desire not to jeopardize the remaining pay the campaign had promised them.Some said they had completed the form sent out by the campaign on Friday, asking them to prioritize their interest in working in 14 different states for the D.N.C.“It’s embarrassing to me, because I worked within my neighborhood,” Elle Zwicky, another former field organizer for Mr. Bloomberg in Minnesota, said Friday. “Now to go back to all these neighbors and friends and community members around me who hosted house parties, volunteered — that’s a breach of trust for the people that gave time and energy to the campaign, that I gathered, that I organized.”Mr. Bloomberg is all but certain to remain a major funder of the Democratic Party, even in the absence of an organization under his direct control.His $18 million contribution to the D.N.C., a figure that far exceeds individual limits, is legal, party officials said, because it is coming in the form of a transfer from the campaign. Individuals are allowed to make unlimited contributions to their own campaigns, and campaigns can make unlimited transfers to political parties.The transfer is also not expected to be Mr. Bloomberg’s last huge contribution to the campaign against Mr. Trump: In recent weeks, he has also announced large donations to three major progressive groups — Swing Left, Collective Future and Voto Latino — and those checks are likely to keep coming.“With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump,” said Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman. “This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot.” Nearly a dozen other former campaign workers expressed frustration in interviews on Friday, saying the pay and promises of job security through November had been key reasons they joined Mr. Bloomberg’s long-shot campaign.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers have resisted calls from congressional Democrats and a growing number of governors to use a federal law that would mobilize industry and provide badly needed resources against the coronavirus spread, days after the president said he would consider using that authority.Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about the Defense Production Act since he first said on Wednesday that he was prepared to invoke the law, which was passed by Congress at the outset of the Korean War and grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.The next day, he suggested that obtaining medical equipment should be up to individual governors because “we’re not a shipping clerk.” But on Friday, he reversed himself, asserting that he had used the law to spur the production of “millions of masks,” without offering evidence or specifics about who was manufacturing them or when they would reach health workers.And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that he was left with the impression after talking with Mr. Trump that he had decided to move to put the act into effect. He said “a commitment on the phone was a good start,” but that the president now needed to push the government “to move full steam ahead.” WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers have resisted calls from congressional Democrats and a growing number of governors to use a federal law that would mobilize industry and provide badly needed resources against the coronavirus spread, days after the president said he would consider using that authority.Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about the Defense Production Act since he first said on Wednesday that he was prepared to invoke the law, which was passed by Congress at the outset of the Korean War and grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.The next day, he suggested that obtaining medical equipment should be up to individual governors because “we’re not a shipping clerk.” But on Friday, he reversed himself, asserting that he had used the law to spur the production of “millions of masks,” without offering evidence or specifics about who was manufacturing them or when they would reach health workers.And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that he was left with the impression after talking with Mr. Trump that he had decided to move to put the act into effect. He said “a commitment on the phone was a good start,” but that the president now needed to push the government “to move full steam ahead.” But Mr. Trump’s confusing statements played out in the middle of a growing health crisis that within days has abruptly and indefinitely altered the course of American life.With the number of coronavirus cases in the United States surging above 17,000 — over 40 percent of those concentrated in New York — front-line health care workers have reported a dire shortage of masks, surgical gowns and eye gear to protect them from the virus. State lawmakers have also implored the president to help them get the supplies they need.

State lawmakers have also implored the president to help them get the supplies they need. Business leaders have said invoking the defense law is not necessary. During his appearance with the members of his coronavirus task force on Friday, Mr. Trump supported that idea and said that private companies, including General Motors, had volunteered to produce supplies without any prompting from the government.“We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work and help our country,” Mr. Trump said. “We have not had a problem with that at all.” Business leaders have said invoking the defense law is not necessary.

It is a big step. I am not sure if it is done before. When we need something, we’ll use it.”Asked Friday night about specific ways the Defense Production Act has been used, the White House said in a statement that the president was “currently using it to drive the private sector’s response to this crisis,” and that he had invoked the act “to ensure that the necessary authorities will be available to prioritize production of items under government contracts and to allocate scarce items where they are needed most.”In signing the executive order on Wednesday to put the act into effect, Mr. Trump said the purpose was to expedite distribution of “health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of Covid-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators,” and that Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, could order production and distribution of supplies, if necessary.But the president did not say if masks and ventilators in anything near the necessary quantity have actually been delivered to the workers who need them.During Friday’s briefing, Mr. Trump grew increasingly confrontational with reporters as they pressed him on the details of the Defense Production Act, and he snapped at Peter Alexander, a reporter for NBC News, who asked him what he would say to Americans who were scared.“I say that you’re a terrible reporter, that’s what I say,” Mr. Trump replied.“It is a bad signal that you are putting out to the American people,” the president continued. “You want to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism.

Kristi Noem, Republican of South Dakota, grew frustrated as she expressed to the president and members of the coronavirus task force that state officials had been working unsuccessfully with private suppliers.“I need to understand how you’re triaging supplies,” Ms. Noem said. “We, for two weeks, were requesting reagents for our public health lab from C.D.C., who pushed us to private suppliers who kept canceling orders on us. And we kept making requests, placing orders.”She added, “I don’t want to be less of a priority because we’re a smaller state or less populated.”Mr. Trump promised her that would “never” happen before Ms. Noem’s telephone line was disconnected.

When it was originally passed, the Defense Production Act granted President Harry S. Truman the power to spur the production of aluminum, titanium and other needed materials during wartime. Since then, it has been used for both the prevention of terrorism and to prepare for natural disasters.The act would give the Trump administration the authority to override companies’ existing contracts and to direct supplies to hot spots like New York City or Seattle. It could also help mobilize funds for retooling factories, refitting pharmacy drive-throughs into testing sites and ramping up production of an eventual vaccine.But John Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that corporate executives were already working “hand in glove” with the government on production challenges.“American companies will do whatever it takes to support our country’s response to the pandemic and shore up the economy,” he said. “The Defense Production Act was designed for defense industry products with a single supplier, often with purely domestic production chains, and invoking it may do more harm than good in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.”Companies that manufacture face masks, medical wipes and other supplies say they are already operating around the clock to meet elevated demand. Some factories that make similar products — like surgical gowns, diapers and incontinence products — have already switched over to manufacture the face masks or other protective gear that health care workers need.But people familiar with the administration’s actions say it is still trying to figure out how industry supply chains operate, which companies could produce additional products and what kinds of subsidies it may need to offer.And without the Defense Production Act, the government will lack the ability to channel these supplies to areas that need it most — or to persuade companies to act quickly and without regard for their profits.

As reported cases of the virus in the United States have soared, Mr. Trump, who is known to recruit input from a variety of outside advisers, has been getting conflicting advice. The proliferating number of private sector voices with direct access to the president and his top advisers — notably his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner — has resulted in a chaotic process.The president’s advisers say they see the role of the federal government as a facilitator, as opposed to the chief producer or a national governor. They have tried to encourage states to get by with what they can, suggesting there will be support from the federal government but that this should not be the first option.In practice, the administration has been trying to use the provision to jawbone companies into taking voluntary action while holding over them the possibility that the federal government would intervene, according to administration officials familiar with the state of play.“We’re actually encouraged that the partnership with the private sector can meeting many of these needs,” said Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, on Friday morning in a discussion with reporters.Katie Rogers and Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

"WASHINGTON — The nation remained fixated on the final acts of the impeachment drama in early February, but as the Senate prepared to acquit President Trump, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, already had his eye on a troubling new threat: the coronavirus.On the morning of Feb. 4, Mr. Burr assembled members of the committee in a secure room on Capitol Hill to hear for the first time from intelligence officials about how foreign powers were responding to what the World Health Organization had days earlier declared a global health emergency.Their warnings were not highly classified or all that specific, drawn largely from diplomatic wires and publicly reported information, according to three people familiar with them. But at a time when the White House was playing down threats from the virus, intelligence officials from the C.I.A. painted an early picture of the outbreak’s geopolitical implications.Around the same time, Mr. Burr, a longtime proponent of increased federal efforts to prepare for a global health pandemic, was receiving similar briefings from top government health officials through another Senate committee he sits on. Those sessions, including an update on Feb. 12, were focused on the readiness of the United States for a potential epidemic, but also touched on the possible economic fallout.

Those sessions, including an update on Feb. 12, were focused on the readiness of the United States for a potential epidemic, but also touched on the possible economic fallout. The next day, Feb. 13, Mr. Burr sold off 33 different stock holdings, worth a collective $628,000 to $1.7 million, liquidating a large share of his portfolio.Mr. Burr’s sale of the shares in the weeks before the market plunged over concerns about the economic impact of the virus at a time when Mr. Trump and other Republican officials were playing down the threat is now coming under intense scrutiny. It has also raised questions about whether he avoided losses by trading on inside information as Americans are looking to Washington for help in a severe crisis.At least four other senators, as well as about two dozen House lawmakers, also sold some of their financial holdings in the same period. Like Mr. Burr, the other senators said they did nothing wrong and were not acting on information unavailable to the general public.The stock sale ignited a political firestorm from both the left and the right, as calls immediately emerged for the resignation of Mr. Burr, who overnight found himself battling to avoid becoming the symbol of a financially advantaged elite at a populist moment.Under pressure to explain himself, Mr. Burr on Friday said that he had asked the Senate Ethics Committee to scrutinize the sales in an attempt to clear his name.

The four other senators — Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, James M.

He said on Friday that his decision had been based “solely on public news reports” out of Asia, largely from CNBC.The matter may be difficult to untangle. As a member of both the Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee and the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr was frequently briefed by national security and health officials on threats to the United States, including potential pandemics like the coronavirus.

He boasted to a North Carolina radio station at the time that he was one of three “brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn’t be doing this.”Publicly available disclosures show that the stock sales by Mr. Burr and his wife included as much as $150,000 in stock in two hotel chains, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Extended Stay America. The stock value of both companies has declined rapidly in recent weeks.As of 2018, the period covered by his most recent financial disclosure report, Mr. Burr had a net worth of about $1.7 million, making him the 154th wealthiest member of Congress, out of the 530 examined by Roll Call in an annual report on lawmakers and their assets.This means his sale on Feb. 13 represented a large share of his wealth; other than his stock portfolio, his assets consisted of real estate in Winston-Salem and Nags Head, N.C., and various bank accounts worth at least $802,000.It was not the first time that Mr. Burr had moved suddenly to protect his wealth.In 2008, after he heard the Treasury secretary at the time, Henry M. Paulson, talk about challenges banks were facing — as the nation was entering a recession — he called his wife and told her to withdraw as much cash as possible from their bank accounts, Mr. Burr told supporters during a speech in North Carolina.“I want you to go to the A.T.M., and I want you to draw out everything it will let you take,” Mr. Burr said, according to an account in The Hendersonville Times-News and The Hill newspaper. “I don’t know whether there is a violation, but it is certainly the type of facts that motivated the passage of the STOCK Act in the first place, and they are certainly the type of facts that warrant an investigation,” Mr. Sanderson said.Mr. Burr was one of only three senators to vote against the legislation, calling the law unnecessary because insider trading is already banned by other laws.

Mr. Burr trades relatively often on his holdings, filing 17 different “periodic transaction reports” last year, which are required when lawmakers buy or sell a stock. But most of these other transactions involved just a couple of purchases or sales, instead of a comprehensive and sudden sale of most of his holdings.The Feb. 13 stock sales by Mr. Burr came a week after he wrote an opinion article for Fox News suggesting that the United States was “better prepared than ever before” to confront the virus, in part because of legislation he had sponsored more than a decade ago called the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act intended to help prepare for such a threat.But Mr. Burr was clearly worried about the threat presented by the coronavirus. He told a group of North Carolina residents gathered last month at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington that the effect would be severe.“There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything we have seen in recent history,” Mr. Burr said, according to a recording obtained by NPR, which reported on his remarks on Thursday.Though as Intelligence Committee chairman he is entitled to additional one-on-one sessions with intelligence officials beyond what other senators hear, Mr. Burr does not appear to have requested any, according to two of the people familiar with the committee’s work, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.Sessions organized by the health committee that Mr. Burr attended were not classified and largely rehashed publicly available information about the virus, according to Senate aides involved. They were intended to prepare senators for the possibility that they might need to help draft a response if and when the virus arrived in the United States.The four other senators each also made significant stock sales between late January and late February at a time when senators were regularly briefed on the virus’s spread. Three of them — Ms. Loeffler, Mr. Perdue and Mr. Inhofe — said that they employed outside financial advisers to buy and sell stocks without their consultation and only learned about the sales after they were completed. Ms. Feinstein said the holdings were controlled by her husband or in a blind trust.

For years, skeptics expressed concern about how he would handle a genuine crisis threatening the nation, and now they know. “When he’s faced a problem, he has sought to somehow cheat or fix the outcome ahead of time so that he could construct a narrative that showed him to be the winner,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer. “And when it was all about feuds with other celebrities or contests over ratings or hotel branding, he could do that and no one cared enough to really check. And the bluster and bragging worked.”“But in this case,” Mr. D’Antonio added, “he tried that in the beginning and you can’t brag or bluster your way out of people dying. And I think more than the suffering, the human suffering, it’s been the inexorable quality of the data that’s forced him to change.”Only after viral projections grew more dire and markets began to tank did Mr. Trump shift tone and appear to take the threat more seriously, finally adopting a more aggressive set of policies to compel Americans to stay away from one another while trying to mitigate the economic damage. “When he’s faced a problem, he has sought to somehow cheat or fix the outcome ahead of time so that he could construct a narrative that showed him to be the winner,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer. “And when it was all about feuds with other celebrities or contests over ratings or hotel branding, he could do that and no one cared enough to really check.

Some in the public seem to have responded. Fifty-five percent of Americans approved of his handling of the crisis in a poll by ABC News and Ipsos released on Friday, up from 43 percent the previous week. A Reuters poll, also conducted with Ipsos, put approval of his handling of the pandemic at 48 percent, up from 38 percent a couple weeks earlier, while surveys by The Economist and YouGov showed a smaller rise, from 41 percent to 45 percent.

But even as he has seemed to take the crisis more seriously, Mr. Trump has continued to make statements that conflicted with the government’s own public health experts and focused energy on blaming China, quarreling with reporters, claiming he knew that the coronavirus would be a pandemic even when he was minimizing its threat only a few weeks ago and congratulating himself for how he has managed a crisis he only recently acknowledged.“We’ve done a fantastic job from just about every standpoint,” he said Tuesday. “We’ve done a great job,” he said Wednesday. “We’ve done a phenomenal job on this,” he said Thursday.The next day he grew irritated when Peter Alexander of NBC News asked if he was giving Americans a “false sense of hope” by promising immediate delivery of a drug that experts said is not proven. Mr. Trump said he disagreed with them. “Just a feeling,” he said. “You know, I’m a smart guy. I feel good about it.”Mr. Alexander moved onto his next question, a “softball” by his own reckoning, asking what Mr. Trump would say to Americans who were at home watching and scared. Most presidents would use the opportunity to offer reassuring words. But Mr. Trump was still steamed and snapped, “I say that you’re a terrible reporter. That’s what I say.”Later in the same briefing, Yamiche Alcindor of PBS’s “NewsHour” asked when everyone who needed a coronavirus test would be able to get one, as he asserted two weeks ago that every person already could. “Nobody is even talking about it except for you, which doesn’t surprise me,” he said dismissively. How about people with symptoms who could not get a test, he was asked. “I’m not hearing it,” he replied.The White House rejects any criticism of the president as illegitimate. “This great country has been faced with an unprecedented crisis, and while the Democrats and the media shamelessly try and destroy this president with a coordinated, relentless, biased political assault, President Trump has risen to fight this crisis head-on by taking aggressive historic action to protect the health, wealth and well-being of the American people,” Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.Mr. Trump acted at the end of January to restrict travel from China, where the outbreak was first detected, and repeatedly points back to that decision, arguing that he saved lives as a result. But he resisted stronger action for weeks. Even as governors, mayors and businesses decided on their own to curb large gatherings and eventually close down schools, restaurants and workplaces, the president at first offered no guidance about whether to take such action.

He has repeatedly misrepresented the state of the response — promising a vaccine “soon” that will actually take at least a year to develop, insisting that tests were available while patients struggled to find any, boasting about the availability of millions of masks while health care workers took to stitching together homemade versions. And dismissing the threat for weeks may have led to complacency among some Americans who could have acted much sooner to take precautions.Mr. Trump’s defensiveness over the pandemic has become a central dynamic inside the White House as officials wrestle with difficult policy choices. Aides have long understood that Mr. Trump needs to hear support for his decisions, preferably described in superlatives. He often second-guesses himself, prompting advisers to ask allies to tell him he made the right call or go on Fox News to make that point in case he might be watching.Over the last week, as Mr. Trump has faced ever more draconian and expensive options, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, sought to coax him into action by using bits of praise in news coverage or from other officials as a motivator, according to people familiar with the discussions.Officials have learned that the president craves a constant diet of flattery, which they serve up during daily televised briefings. Vice President Mike Pence makes a point of repeating it day after day, sometimes repeatedly in the course of a single briefing. “Mr. President, from early on, you took decisive action,” he said during one.Other advisers have followed suit. “Thank you, Mr. President, for gathering your public health experts here today and for your strong leadership in keeping America safe,” Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, told him at one point. “I want to thank you for your leadership during this coronavirus outbreak,” Dr. Stephen M.

Fauci, the veteran infectious diseases expert known for his just-the-facts style, has sometimes joined in praise of the president, at one point referring to Mr. Trump’s “proactive, leaning-forward, aggressive, trying to stay ahead of the curve” approach. While Dr. Fauci does not hesitate to correct the president’s facts, as he did on Friday over the unproven drug, he does so politely, careful to maintain his viability within a political team. Still, many noticed that he put his hand to his face in seeming disbelief when Mr. Trump referred to his diplomats as the “Deep State Department.” Even Dr. Anthony S.

Still, many noticed that he put his hand to his face in seeming disbelief when Mr. Trump referred to his diplomats as the “Deep State Department.” Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said Mr. Trump had been unfairly criticized for his handling of the virus. “The media virtually ignore the president’s massive effort mobilizing the federal government, our industrial base and the scientific and medical community to combat this pandemic, rivaling F.D.R.’s arsenal of democracy,” he said.Mr. King said that Mr. Trump was working with Democrats but the news media “prefer to dwell on initial failure of C.D.C. test kits and low inventory of masks and ventilators going back two administrations.” Still, he said of Mr. Trump, “He too often takes the bait.”None of which comes as a surprise to those who dealt with Mr. Trump or studied his life before he became president. In real estate, he found he could overcome crises by bluffing his way past regulators, bullying the bankers and bamboozling the tabloids.When banks came after him for overdue loans, he pushed back, arguing that it was in their interest that his brand not be harmed by calling him out. When contractors demanded to be paid, he found complaints about their work and refused, leading in part to more than 3,500 lawsuits. When his first two marriages fell apart, he took a scorched-earth approach against his wives, leaking to New York’s gossip columnists even if it meant his children watched ugly divorces play out in public.“The typical modus operandi from him is to bluff, is to fake, is to deny,” said Jack O’Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City.When Mr. Trump prepared to open the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City in 1990 and ran into trouble with the authorities, he summoned Mr. O’Donnell. “He told them I was an expert in operations and I could fix this,” Mr. O’Donnell recalled. “And they believed him.

The self-described “king of debt” treated loan repayments almost as if they were optional and made it a mantra never to back down. “I figured it was the bank’s problem, not mine,” he wrote in one of his books. “What the hell did I care? I actually told one bank, ‘I told you, you shouldn’t have loaned me that money.’” To Mr. Trump, most of his crises were about paper and money, not people.

He seemed genuinely shaken, visiting the widows to share in their grief.“I actually think he handled that situation about as well as you could expect from him,” Mr. O’Donnell said. “It was such a shock to him. It was the first time I heard fear in his voice. It was the first time I saw empathy, that I saw emotion from him, because he realized the human loss there.”Even then, Mr. Trump could not help inserting himself into the story, suggesting falsely that he almost boarded the helicopter himself. And within months, with his Taj project flailing, Mr. Trump began publicly attributing problems to the dead executives. In a crisis, “he always was more focused on who he could blame versus fixing the problem,” said Mr. O’Donnell, who quit in disgust.Nor did Mr. Trump exhibit much empathy for the workers who lost their jobs when his casinos went bust. Instead, when asked about his failed Atlantic City ventures, he emphasizes his own ability to escape unharmed. “The money I took out of there was incredible,” he once told The New York Times.The closest analogue to the current situation may be the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, another national trauma. Mr. Trump tried to thrust himself into the news coverage, telling an interviewer by phone that day that with the destruction of the World Trade Center he now had the tallest building in New York City, a claim that was not even true. He also has said he spent extensive time around the site trying to help the cleanup, a claim that has never been verified.With the airports closed at the time, Mr. Trump was asked to provide his private plane to fly Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki to Washington for President George W. Bush’s address to Congress. Mr. Trump agreed — but in return asked for help getting permission to travel from Washington to another destination when others were grounded.

By his own account, Mr. Trump never imagined that he would be facing a pandemic, an invisible killer immune to bluster. “In every previous occasion, he was facing a human being or groups of human beings,” said Gwenda Blair, the author of a biography of the Trump family. “And obviously the coronavirus, it’s not a person, can’t be bullied.”So Mr. Trump, with his recent descriptions of a war to be won over a “foreign enemy,” is seeking a dynamic that he is familiar with, personifying the virus as an opponent to be beaten, framing it as the kind of crisis he knows how to tackle. “He’s trying to make it into a win-lose situation,” she said. “That’s how he sees the world — winners, him, losers everybody else. He’s trying to make the coronavirus into a loser and himself the winner.”Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

He’s trying to make the coronavirus into a loser and himself the winner.”Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.","Used to Meeting Challenges With Bluster and Force, Trump Confronts a Crisis Unlike Any Before",2020-03-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-leadership.html,new_york_times
"WASHINGTON — The idea to funnel cash directly to millions of Americans to help them weather the economic disaster ravaging the globe amid the coronavirus pandemic got its jump-start not from the liberal left, but from a more unlikely source: the most conservative reaches of the Republican Party.Recognizing a looming calamity for anxious people who are losing their incomes because of a government-ordered shutdown of much of the nation’s economy, some senators who would normally be expected to block a direct federal payout to the poorest Americans, potentially costing $500 billion or more, instead got behind it early.The idea is at the heart of an emerging economic stabilization package whose price tag was swelling beyond $1 trillion on Saturday as top Republicans and Democrats and Trump administration officials drew closer to an agreement that could be enacted within days.“I believe we are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in a statement Saturday night, before a test vote on Sunday meant to pave the way for passage of the package on Monday.

In a round of feverish private negotiations that unfolded on Capitol Hill and included Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, the largest sticking point appeared to be the scope of jobless aid that should be included. With Democrats pressing to broaden the scope of unemployment insurance, Republicans had agreed to a significant expansion of the program that would cover almost all wages and offer benefits to those who are self-employed and people whose hours had been reduced, according to two people familiar with the emerging deal who insisted on anonymity to discuss details that were still being finished.But there was little disagreement about sending cash payments to Americans as part of the extraordinary government rescue, with Republicans leading the charge. It was a striking populist turn for a party that has been dominated for decades by small-government activists, including some who rose to political prominence in the wake of the Wall Street bailout and are now determined to steer federal help to the most vulnerable of their constituents.“This is a public health crisis of the likes that has not been seen in a century,” said Senator Tom Cotton, a deeply conservative Republican from Arkansas and one of the chief proponents of getting cash in the hands of hurting Americans as quickly as possible. “Our government at every level has to take responsibility for caring for our people and caring for their health and their material well-being as well.” In a round of feverish private negotiations that unfolded on Capitol Hill and included Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, the largest sticking point appeared to be the scope of jobless aid that should be included.

But there was Mr. Cotton on “Fox & Friends” last week, pushing the idea of a quick cash infusion to counter the economic devastation of the coronavirus outbreak. A few hours later, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, proposed on Twitter that “every American adult should immediately receive a one-time check for $1,000.” The idea was first met with skepticism and even incredulity.But as it became clear there was bipartisan opposition to President Trump’s push for a payroll tax holiday, Mr. Mnuchin got onboard and the cash idea quickly transformed from pipe dream to reality, to the centerpiece of Senate Republicans’ roughly $1 trillion rescue plan. The optics were jarring, since it is Republicans who usually accuse Democrats of being too quick to throw taxpayer money around.“Senate Republicans want to put cash in Americans’ hands,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor as colleagues of both parties worked behind closed doors to hammer out the details of the economic stabilization plan.Not everyone was as enthusiastic about the cash payments. Some Republican colleagues balked, Democrats had reservations about the scope and distribution of the payments and conservative fiscal watchdog groups were aghast.David McIntosh, the head of the free-market Club for Growth, said Republicans seemed to have borrowed the idea from Andrew Yang, the former Democratic presidential candidate who proposed a $1,000 universal monthly income. The idea, Mr. McIntosh noted, was ridiculed by Republicans just a few weeks ago.“It is panic-driven — panic on Capitol Hill,” Mr. McIntosh said. “There is no indication it would work or make a difference. They are throwing up any idea.”Under the Senate Republicans’ original bill, individuals could receive one-time checks of a maximum of $1,200 or $2,400 for married couples, in addition to $500 a child. Those earning more money would get a bigger check, and the payment would phase out for those earning more than $75,000, ending entirely for taxpayers with more than $99,000 in income or families earning $198,000. The initial Senate measure would also reduce the payments to $600 for people with no income tax liability but at least $2,500 in earnings.

But those provisions came under attack from lawmakers in both parties and were quickly overhauled in the bipartisan negotiations, in favor of a program that would send the full amount to those at lower income levels. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri and another ultraconservative, was among those pushing for that change.Republican resistance to the cash payments came from Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said it was more practical to use unemployment insurance to supplement income. Other Senate Republican said privately that they were not convinced that the cash payout would be all that effective, but they were not about to jump in front of a moving legislative train and look as if they were denying relief to struggling constituents.On the Democratic side, progressives were pushing for more generous payments on a monthly basis during the crisis and higher eligibility levels. But Democratic leaders were reluctant to face accusations that they had pushed for checks going to the affluent. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, also wanted to make sure due consideration was given to other Democratic priorities, such as a significant expansion of unemployment insurance and aid to states and hospitals.Some Democrats acknowledged they were taken aback by the willingness of Republicans to embrace such spending.“I’m more worried about the deficit than most Republicans,” said Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, who favors targeted cash payments.Senate Republicans were determined to go big with the economic assistance plan after Mr. McConnell allowed the Trump White House and congressional Democrats to largely take the lead on the first two emergency relief packages, leaving some of his party’s senators frustrated. The strategy opened the door to expansive legislative proposals as Senate Republicans sought to put their own stamp on the pandemic response.A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney said that given his business background, he was aware of the potential hardship for sidelined employees and focused on cash assistance to speed aid, rather than trying to rely on a more complicated system of existing unemployment programs and tax breaks.

President George W. Bush did so twice in 2001 and again in 2008 during that years’s economic downturn, to mixed reviews. But this is the first time since the inception of the Tea Party movement, which stirred a backlash in 2010 against government intervention and bailout programs.The Club for Growth endorsed Mr. Cotton in his first Senate run in 2014, and Mr. McIntosh said he was surprised by the senator’s strong support of the cash payment plan, since he usually backs “what will work.”His prominent support is a risk to Mr. Cotton, who has been discussed as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024, if the proposal is later found to be wasteful and ineffective. But he seems confident of the approach based on his understanding of economic conditions in his home state and the threat posed to virtually every American by the economic halt.“Growing up where I did, folks were frequently working paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “I certainly don’t hear the perspective you would hear if you were a rich guy in New York or Washington or another big city and everyone you know works at a big financial firm or a Fortune 500 company.”Emily Cochrane and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting. “He kind of just put it out there without a lot of detail, knowing there would be a conversation about it,” said Liz Johnson, Mr. Romney’s spokeswoman. “Consensus grew around it literally overnight.”This isn’t the first time the government has sent out checks under a Republican president.

"In mid-January, a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders’s pollster offered a stark prognosis for the campaign: Mr. Sanders was on track to finish strong in the first three nominating states, but Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s powerful support from older African-Americans could make him a resilient foe in South Carolina and beyond.The pollster, Ben Tulchin, in a meeting with campaign aides, recommended a new offensive to influence older black voters, according to three people briefed on his presentation. The data showed two clear vulnerabilities for Mr. Biden: his past support for overhauling Social Security, and his authorship of a punitive criminal justice law in the 1990s.But the suggestion met with resistance. Some senior advisers argued that it wasn’t worth diverting resources from Iowa and New Hampshire, people familiar with the campaign’s deliberations said. Others pressed Mr. Tulchin on what kind of message, exactly, would make voters rethink their support for the most loyal ally of the first black president.Crucially, both Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, consistently expressed reservations about going negative on Mr. Biden, preferring to stick with the left-wing policy message they have been pressing for 40 years.

The warnings about Mr. Biden proved prescient: Two months later, Mr. Sanders is now all but vanquished in the Democratic presidential race, after Mr. Biden resurrected his campaign in South Carolina and built an overwhelming coalition of black voters and white moderates on Super Tuesday.While Mr. Sanders has not ended his bid, he has fallen far behind Mr. Biden in the delegate count and has taken to trumpeting his success in the battle of ideas rather than arguing that he still has a path to the nomination. His efforts to regain traction have faltered in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has frozen the campaign, and perhaps heightened the appeal of Mr. Biden’s safe-and-steady image.In the view of some Sanders advisers, the candidate’s abrupt decline was a result of unforeseeable and highly unlikely events — most of all, the sudden withdrawal of two major candidates, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who instantly threw their support to Mr. Biden and helped spur a rapid coalescing of moderate support behind his campaign.Mr. Sanders had been “on the brink of winning,” Mr. Tulchin argued, “until the most unprecedented event in the history of presidential primaries occurred.”But interviews with more than three dozen Sanders aides, elected officials, activists and other people who worked with his campaign revealed a more extensive picture of his reversal of political fortune. Though Mr. Sanders climbed to a position of seeming dominance by mid-February, he and his inner circle also made a series of fateful decisions that left him ill positioned to win over skeptical Democrats — and sorely vulnerable to an opponent with Mr. Biden’s strengths.

Though Mr. Sanders climbed to a position of seeming dominance by mid-February, he and his inner circle also made a series of fateful decisions that left him ill positioned to win over skeptical Democrats — and sorely vulnerable to an opponent with Mr. Biden’s strengths. Mr. Sanders proved unable to expand his base well beyond the left or to win over African-Americans in meaningful numbers. He failed to heed warnings from traditional party leaders, and even from within his campaign, about the need to modulate his message and unify Democrats. He allowed internal arguments to fester within his campaign, an ungainly operation that fragmented into factions beneath the only two real decision makers — Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane.Though outwardly amiable, Mr. Sanders’s inner circle fractured between some long-serving counselors and relative newcomers, like Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager. Mr. Shakir and others regarded pleas from Mr. Tulchin and another pugilistic aide, David Sirota, to go on the attack against Mr. Biden as both futile and annoyingly predictable, while Mr. Shakir’s internal critics saw him as exceedingly territorial.

There were also serious operational mistakes: In South Carolina, the campaign effectively deputized a former Ohio state senator and loyal surrogate, Nina Turner, to direct strategy, rather than empowering a political strategist to run the pivotal early state. In private conversations, Mr. Sanders often touted his support from some younger African-Americans, seemingly missing the bigger picture.And for all of Mr. Tulchin’s alarm in January about South Carolina, on the eve of the primary he was reassuring Mr. Sanders that a public poll showing him down over 20 percentage points in the state was “an outlier for good reason.”In an email sent to Mr. Sanders and a group of senior aides, Mr. Tulchin reminded the senator that their internal polling had him trailing Mr. Biden by only four points. Two days later, the former vice president would win South Carolina by nearly 30 points.

Perhaps the most significant factor, as with every presidential campaign, was the candidate himself, and the stubborn ideological and stylistic consistency that both endeared Mr. Sanders to his supporters and limited his ability to build a majority coalition larger than his own progressive movement.

He ruled out several lines of attack against the former vice president because they touched on Mr. Biden’s role in the Obama administration, which Democratic primary voters revere.Mr. Shakir and a second senior aide, Ari Rabin-Havt, took Mr. Sanders’s side and repeatedly reminded other campaign officials that Mr. Sanders was the ultimate decision maker on the campaign. In conversations with associates, both men agreed that it might make sense to criticize Mr. Biden in a sharper way. But they said Mr. Sanders could not be persuaded to do so: He and Jane liked the Bidens personally, and their word was final.The fissures within the campaign leadership extended beyond how to deal with Mr. Biden.

In January, efforts by Ms. Turner and others to direct some campaign resources into Super Tuesday states fizzled against opposition from Mr. Shakir and others. Mr. Shakir was adamant that Mr. Sanders’s path to the nomination ran principally through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and the California primary on Super Tuesday.There was also a running argument within the campaign about how to handle Senator Elizabeth Warren, with some advisers viewing her as a serious threat that needed to be quashed and others, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Sanders’s most important endorser, urging the campaign to seek conciliation.The dispute erupted publicly in January, when CNN reported that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren in 2018 that he did not believe a woman could defeat President Trump, an assertion Mr. Sanders denied.

It would linger over both of them for the remainder of the race.

Revolutionary to a FaultDespite the divisions within his campaign, Mr. Sanders cut a winning path through the first few states to vote, culminating with a landslide victory in Nevada on Feb. 22. In his speech that night, Mr. Sanders sounded a unifying note, focusing on his “multigenerational, multiracial coalition.”Encountering a pair of reporters in a Las Vegas hotel that evening, Mr. Tulchin — strolling to dinner with Mr. Weaver — crowed that Mr. Sanders had delivered a speech worthy of the general election. Mr. Weaver was more subdued, noting that the primary fight was not over.The speech turned out to be a blip between Mr. Sanders’s anti-establishment diatribes. And there was little aides could do to steer him in a different direction: The chief speechwriter on the Sanders campaign was Mr. Sanders.For months, his political advisers and outside allies had quietly mulled a shift in tone — the possibility that Mr. Sanders might take even modest steps to show skeptical Democrats that he could unify the party.

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez repeatedly urged the campaign to broaden Mr. Sanders’s message and seek out new allies, outside his familiar base. (In a statement, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez denied any “tension or major disagreements” with Mr. Sanders.)RoseAnn DeMoro, the former leader of the nurses union who was one of Mr. Sanders’s most ferocious surrogates in 2016, and the actor John Cusack, another ally, both pressed the campaign to refocus Mr. Sanders’s pitch on a general-election audience, people familiar with their entreaties said.Mr. Cusack urged the Sanders campaign to address voters beyond its progressive base, proposing that the senator give a speech at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and citing its namesake’s connection to environmentalism and fighting poverty. “His campaign needs to create a unit that is charged with outreach to groups who do NOT identify as progressive, but have strong views that are aligned with his.

In the weeks before Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders had indeed refused to yield to critics who were searching for gestures of accommodation. In Nevada, leaders of the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226 were frustrated that Mr. Sanders did not speak out more forcefully when his supporters heaped abuse on predominantly female union leaders over their opposition to “Medicare for all.”As Culinary officials were deluged with vitriol, including graphic and misogynistic messages, Mr. Sanders placed a phone call to the union’s secretary-treasurer, Geoconda Argüello-Kline, but they never connected.“Our feeling was that Senator Sanders should have said something earlier and should have been stronger about it,” said Bethany Khan, a political strategist for the union.And then there was Cuba: In February, Democratic officials in Florida reached out to propose convening some conversations between Mr. Sanders and Latino leaders in South Florida, many of whom were nervous about his rhetoric on socialism and revolution. The Sanders campaign showed tentative interest, people familiar with the conversations said.Then, the day after the Nevada caucuses, CBS aired a “60 Minutes” interview in which Mr. Sanders stood by his past praise for certain policies of Fidel Castro’s government.

And he made no attempt at private damage control: None of the lawmakers who rebuked him in public heard from Mr. Sanders or his senior aides.His campaign eventually dispatched emissaries, including the actress and activist Cynthia Nixon, to meet quietly with Latino groups in Orlando after Super Tuesday, but they could not assure local Democrats that Mr. Sanders would change course before Florida’s March 17 primary.

Indeed, until then, Mr. Sanders’s campaign was expecting to win seven or eight of the 14 states voting on Super Tuesday and seize a solid delegate lead over the rest of the Democratic field.So confident was Mr. Sanders that he would vanquish Mr. Biden that he spent valuable days trying to force two other candidates out of the race by campaigning in Minnesota and Massachusetts, the home states of Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren.

In early November 1918, the statewide ban on public gatherings was lifted and politicians were allowed to campaign for five days before polls were opened. Men — women did not yet have the right to vote — filed in to cast ballots for a Senate seat, which the incumbent Republican senator was able to hold on to. Afterward, infections and deaths climbed, said Dr. Watkins.“The disease appeared to be reaching a significant amount of the population, greater than ever before; and the timing coincides with the lifting of the quarantine,” Dr. Watkins wrote in her dissertation, noting that “the political machine disregarded the health and safety of its citizens.”That year, turnout across the nation was very low for the midterms, said Julian E. Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University.

To avoid such an outcome this year, many political scientists and researchers are calling for more early and absentee voting as well as the loosening of restrictions on showing identification in person.“Our main concern needs to be doing everything possible to increase voting participation and eliminating barriers, especially given the heath situation,” said Professor Zelizer.But when he thinks about 1918, the fact that elections were held at all, he said, should offer optimism for the future.“There have been moments like this but overall it’s not as if the system is suspended,” he said. “We have a pretty strong commitment to moving through.” That result — low turnout, voters getting fatally ill — is the worst outcome for any election.

But at the White House, in recent days, there has been a growing sentiment that medical experts were allowed to set policy that has hurt the economy, and there has been a push to find ways to let people start returning to work. Some Republican lawmakers have also pleaded with the White House to find ways to restart the economy, as financial markets continue to slide and job losses for April could be in the millions.Vice President Mike Pence indicated on Sunday at a White House briefing about the virus that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would issue new guidelines on Monday, allowing some people who have been exposed to the coronavirus to resume working outside their homes if they wear masks.The move could set the stage for states with relatively low numbers of cases to begin to unfreeze their economies, while large states like California and New York — where there are more cases and where state officials have ordered nonessential businesses to close for the time being — could continue remaining in a holding pattern.

Mr. Trump’s tweet cast doubt on his confidence in the path to fighting the virus that he so reluctantly approved. For two months he largely dismissed the warnings that the virus would reach American shores, for fear of causing economic disruption, predicting that cases would go down from a handful to “zero” in a few days.Only when the disruption came anyway, in the form of a historic stock market sell-off, was he convinced to act.But there could be consequences to ending the measures too quickly. The recent rise of cases in Hong Kong, after there had been an easing of the spread of the virus, is something of an object lesson about how ending strict measures too soon can have dangerous consequences.In a tweet on Monday morning, Thomas Bossert, the former homeland security adviser who for weeks has been vocal about the need for the U.S. government to take stricter measures, said, “Sadly, the numbers now suggest the U.S. is poised to take the lead in #coronavirus cases. It’s reasonable to plan for the US to top the list of countries with the most cases in approximately 1 week. This does NOT make social intervention futile. It makes it imperative!”Whatever the president chooses to do, there will be businesses still fearful to reopen — and employees fearful of going to work — as new cases of people infected with the virus are still being diagnosed by the thousands each day.And the president is facing potential pushback from the public health experts in his administration.

After being slow to publicly react to the spread of the virus, the Trump administration swung in the other direction at the end of February, entrusting the health experts whose counsel had not been heeded in the preceding weeks and letting them help set the policies that hundreds of millions of people would be urged to follow.But Mr. Trump has become frustrated with Dr. Fauci’s blunt approach at the briefing lectern, which often contradicts things the president has just said, according to two people familiar with the dynamic.Mr. Trump knows that Dr. Fauci is seen as credible with a large swath of the public and with journalists, and so he has given him more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials. But the president has also resisted portraying the virus as an existential threat in a way that the public health experts have.In an interview with Science Magazine that was posted online on Sunday evening, Dr. Fauci responded to a question about how he had managed not to get fired by saying that, to Mr. Trump’s “credit, even though we disagree on some things, he listens.”“He goes his own way,” Dr. Fauci continued. “He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.”But he also said there was a limit to what he could do when Mr. Trump said things that were not true during those briefings.“I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Mr. Fauci said of Mr. Trump’s erroneous statements. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.” After being slow to publicly react to the spread of the virus, the Trump administration swung in the other direction at the end of February, entrusting the health experts whose counsel had not been heeded in the preceding weeks and letting them help set the policies that hundreds of millions of people would be urged to follow.But Mr. Trump has become frustrated with Dr. Fauci’s blunt approach at the briefing lectern, which often contradicts things the president has just said, according to two people familiar with the dynamic.Mr. Trump knows that Dr. Fauci is seen as credible with a large swath of the public and with journalists, and so he has given him more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials.

"新冠病毒疫情最新消息 新冠病毒疫情最新消息 India extends its lockdown to cover almost the entire nation of 1.3 billion.The Indian authorities are grounding all domestic flights and putting most of the country, the world’s second most populous, in full lockdown.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in India remains relatively low — about 400 — but the government wants to lock things down before the virus spikes in the densely populated country. It has steadily tightened restrictions, first ending all international flights and now grounding domestic ones, starting Wednesday at midnight.

It has steadily tightened restrictions, first ending all international flights and now grounding domestic ones, starting Wednesday at midnight. Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted an urgent appeal on Twitter on Monday: “Many people are still not taking the lockdown seriously,” he said. “Please, save yourself, save your family, follow the instructions seriously.”In New Delhi, the capital, the front page of all major newspapers featured a full-page announcement outlining the new restrictions. They reminded residents that the country has a long history of fighting disease, reaching back to the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 that was instituted in British-occupied India to combat the bubonic plague. The law has been used to combat outbreaks of swine flu, cholera and malaria.But nothing on this scale has been tried before, and there was some confusion as to the scope of the new edict. For instance, food stores were supposed to be exempted, but in some neighborhoods the police ordered small grocery stores to close.India was one of the first nations to essentially shut its borders, canceling visas and denying entry to all but a few foreigners. But the containment measures have been imperfect, and fear has started to spread.

Among the drugs on the list was remdesivir, an experimental antiviral produced by Gilead Sciences that has been used in emergency cases to treat the coronavirus. But the company said on Sunday that it was suspending access to emergency requests for remdesivir, citing an “exponential increase” in such requests as the virus spreads through Europe and the United States.As coronavirus cases have increased around the world, demand has overwhelmed “an emergency treatment access system that was set up for very limited access to investigation medicines and never intended for use in response to a pandemic,” the company said in a statement.The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the website bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.Also on the list was chloroquine, a malaria medication that has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.

"WASHINGTON — With the economy faltering and the political landscape unsettled as the coronavirus death toll climbs, a stark and unavoidable question now confronts President Trump and his advisers: Can he save his campaign for re-election when so much is suddenly going so wrong?After three years of Republicans’ championing signs of financial prosperity that were to be Mr. Trump’s chief re-election argument, the president has never needed a new message to voters as he does now, not to mention luck. At this point, the president has one clear option for how to proceed politically, and is hoping that an array of factors will break his way.The option, which he has brazenly pushed in recent days, is to cast himself as a “wartime president” who looks in charge of a nation under siege while his likely Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is largely out of sight hunkered down in Delaware. This gambit, however, requires a rewriting of history — Mr. Trump’s muted approach to the virus early on — and it’s far from clear if many voters will accept the idea of him as a wartime leader.Then there are other variables that he and his allies hope will fall in their favor: that the outbreak of the virus will slow and, in the warmer months, dissipate; that the states will get it under control; that the federal government’s steps taken so far will flatten the curve; that Mr. Biden and the Democrats will look impotent and inconsequential by comparison; and that enough voters will move past his initial efforts to play down the virus’s dangers.

The great unknown, of course — and the tremendous risk to Mr. Trump’s political fate, no matter what he says or does — is that the human cost, the economic toll, and the longevity and course of the pandemic are all X factors that will most likely play out for months and could be strongly salient if not severe by the time of the November general election.In perhaps the best-case scenario for Mr. Trump, the patina of a “wartime president” could prove to be influential with casual voters who don’t dig into the details of his belated response to the coronavirus, which included dismissing the criticism of his handling of the threat as a Democratic “hoax” and contributing to a slow start in testing for the virus.“He is counting on people being so traumatized on a day-to-day basis that they will forget his inaction,” said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. “It’s better for him to be a wartime commander in chief than someone who, when the big crisis hit, misread it completely.”Politically, Mr. Brinkley said, the new posture made sense. “He can claim credit for the curve flattening at some point,” he said, “and hope people will be afraid to push a leader out of office if the crisis pushes into the fall.”The president’s course correction showed some quick results that were seized on by his political advisers. An ABC News poll released last week showed that 55 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic, up from 43 percent the week before.

Rarely have incumbent presidents seen their arguments for re-election evaporate so quickly. Mr. Trump and his advisers had planned to argue that the strong economy warranted a second term and that supporters and detractors alike wanted their 401(k)’s in the Trump-era stock market; that has now become an impossible sell. And as the administration negotiates an enormous bailout package with Congress for multiple industries, his strategy of caricaturing Democrats as “socialists” is not tenable either.So Mr. Trump is trying to mount a new version of his old argument: that “I alone can fix it,” as he said at the 2016 Republican convention about the nation’s problems. He is counting on enough voters believing they have to stick by a leader in the midst of an immense global crisis.Addressing fearful Americans, Mr. Trump said on Sunday evening: “You have a leader that will always fight for you and I will not stop until we win. This is going to be a victory.” He added at another point, “No American is alone as long as we’re united.”But shortly after reading his new script on Sunday night, Mr. Trump mocked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah for self-quarantining. “Romney’s in isolation? Gee, that’s too bad,” he said sarcastically at the briefing room podium.Mr. Trump is on uncertain political ground. His poll numbers in critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have been wavering, with most surveys showing him behind Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Republican officials are banking on voters seeing him as take-charge in contrast to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, who have been following the government’s guidance about staying indoors but have not yet found memorable ways to show how they would lead in this crisis.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have held news conferences from remote locations, and Mr. Biden has participated in “virtual” fund-raisers. While Mr. Biden has an all but insurmountable lead in the race for the Democratic nomination, he has no real ability to steer events because he is not officially the presumptive nominee, and therefore is not the head of the party either.

As a result, Mr. Biden finds himself with far fewer options than Mr. Trump or Democratic governors like Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who have real authority and are holding news conferences often broadcast live.In turn, Republican officials and Sanders allies are pushing out attacks on Mr. Biden’s low profile, asking “Where’s Joe?” in emails to supporters and the news media.

(A spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said Sunday that Mr. Biden had not been tested for the virus because he had shown no symptoms.) But the “wartime” strategy also presents risks to Mr. Trump. In his new posture, he is trying to rewrite recent history, erasing his comments from as recently as a week ago when he told Americans that they needed to “just relax” because “it all will pass.” It is also undercut by his resistance to calls for additional federal action from governors in hard-hit states.Mr. Trump’s temperament is also dissimilar to “wartime presidents” with whom he is seeking to compare himself. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Trump has struggled to stick to any bipartisan message, or speak emotionally to the pain and fear of Americans during crisis points like natural disasters or mass shootings.“That’s why it’s so hard to be a wartime president,” said Michael Beschloss, the historian and author of “Presidents of War.” “Not only are you coming up with a strategy and tactics, but at the same time you have to let Americans know that you know how hard this is for them.”Mr. Trump, so far, has struggled to feel anyone’s pain, unlike past presidents, while continuing to play out the fights with the news media that enliven his base. Last week, he lashed out at a journalist who had prompted him to explain what his message was to the millions of Americans watching him from home, who felt scared.

But Mr. Beschloss added that “part of being a wartime president is being willing to give people bad news,” a job Mr. Trump has mostly left to others.At the same time, he has been timid of using wartime powers to fight what he has called an “invisible enemy.” Last week, for instance, he resisted invoking the Defense Production Act, a federal law that grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.Mr. Trump’s allies are aware that his re-election now hangs almost entirely on how he handles the crisis. And the question is whether he will be seen as President George W. Bush was in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he was widely viewed as bringing the nation together, or if he will be compared to Mr. Bush amid the fallout from Hurricane Katrina, when he tried to minimize a crisis that eventually became too big for him to ignore, and during which Mr. Bush praised cabinet officials even as the federal government bungled the response.Aides said that how Mr. Trump ends up being perceived would also depend on Mr. Trump’s own disposition during the crisis. It is not clear to them whether he will be able to maintain his focus on the crisis for months, especially as the economic situation worsens. Over the weekend, some Trump advisers weren’t ready to accept the likelihood of jobless claims climbing into the millions by next month.The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, defended Mr. Trump’s response as apolitical. “While it seems many in the media continue to use every opportunity to destroy this president, the fact remains that he has risen to fight this crisis by taking aggressive historic action to protect the health, wealth and well-being of the American people,” Ms. Grisham said in an email.Some Democrats, meanwhile, said the mistakes made at the beginning of the response had already colored how Mr. Trump would be remembered both in the history books and at the ballot box in November. “At the end of the day, this will be Katrina with the waters at a much higher level, and lasting a longer time,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.But there is an emerging split in Democratic circles about whether to attack Mr. Trump’s response to the virus in real time, or whether the gravity of the moment calls for a pause in negative political advertising and attacks.

Some of Mr. Trump’s highest-profile political adversaries leading states that have become epicenters of the virus have been striking conciliatory notes as they seek federal assistance. Mr. Cuomo said the president was “fully engaged” on the crisis. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, described a recent phone conversation with Mr. Trump as “a privilege.”Other antagonists have continued to criticize him. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York tapped into one of Mr. Trump’s greatest fears when he referred to him on CNN as the “Herbert Hoover of his generation,” comparing him to a president who failed to recognize or take bold actions to stave off the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression.The debate about whether to embrace or attack Mr. Trump in a national emergency played out most succinctly on Twitter between David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the two men who led Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns.Mr. Axelrod said that voters would have plenty of time to judge Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, “but now doesn’t seem the moment for negative ads.” Mr. Plouffe responded that time was of the essence, and that Democrats couldn’t afford to “disarm” and let Mr. Trump create his own reality.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the likely Democratic nominee against President Trump in this year’s general election, was asked a question during a virtual fund-raiser on Sunday that reflected a challenge looming over his campaign as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies.“What I’m concerned about is that we see Donald Trump every day with this crisis giving his press report,” said one donor, according to a pool report from the fund-raiser, which was conducted by telephone. “And I would just love to see you more. Like, how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?”Mr. Biden has been taunted by online critics over his relatively low profile since the coronavirus forced him off the campaign trail, with Trump campaign officials and others needling him with the hashtag #WhereIsJoe. The former vice president has not made an appearance on camera in front of the public since he gave a brief live-streamed address from his home on Tuesday, when primaries were held in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.At Sunday’s fund-raiser, Mr. Biden said that a recreation room in his home in Delaware had been turned into a television studio, and that he planned to give remarks on Monday. On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Biden said his campaign was working to increase his ability to speak to the public. Former Vice President Joseph R.

On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Biden said his campaign was working to increase his ability to speak to the public. “I want to be in daily or at least, you know, significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think we should be doing and how we should be doing it,” Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden’s campaign got off to a rocky start with its efforts at virtual campaigning, as a “virtual town hall” with Illinois voters this month was marred by technical problems.At Sunday’s virtual fund-raiser, Mr. Biden addressed speculation about whether Mr. Trump would try to postpone the general election because of the coronavirus. (The president does not have that authority.)“The idea of postponing the electoral process is just, seems to me, out of the question,” Mr. Biden said. “I know there’s a lot of rumors and speculation as to, ‘Is the other guy going to try to postpone the election in November?’ and all that. There’s no need to do that.”Mr. Biden also indicated that he was giving serious thought to his potential future running mate, saying that he must “start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks.” “I want to be in daily or at least, you know, significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think we should be doing and how we should be doing it,” Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden’s campaign got off to a rocky start with its efforts at virtual campaigning, as a “virtual town hall” with Illinois voters this month was marred by technical problems.At Sunday’s virtual fund-raiser, Mr. Biden addressed speculation about whether Mr. Trump would try to postpone the general election because of the coronavirus.

There’s no need to do that.”Mr. Biden also indicated that he was giving serious thought to his potential future running mate, saying that he must “start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks.” “There will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at, because those background checks matter,” said Mr. Biden, who has gone through the process himself. He expressed hope that “once I pick someone, God willing if I’m the nominee, that there’s not going to be any snafu.”Mr. Biden’s remaining opponent in the primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has also shifted to campaigning virtually. Mr. Sanders held a live-streamed event on the coronavirus from Burlington, Vt., on Sunday, one of several such events he has done in recent days.Since in-person campaigning came to a halt, Mr. Biden and his team have weighed in repeatedly about the coronavirus, sharply criticizing Mr. Trump’s handling of the crisis. But he has struggled to break through given the flood of news about the outbreak, and he lacks the kind of platform that is available to Mr. Trump, who has appeared daily at White House briefings on the virus.Mr. Biden gave a speech about the coronavirus this month and released a plan for responding to the outbreak, and on Friday’s conference call with reporters, he urged the president to “stop saying false things.” But in the past week, he has been largely out of sight even as his campaign presses its case against Mr. Trump over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Biden’s team has issued a number of written statements and has posted repeatedly on social media about the subject. His campaign released a video in which Ronald Klain, a former chief of staff to Mr. Biden who served as the Ebola response coordinator in the Obama White House, stands in front of a white board and discusses Mr. Trump’s handling of the virus and how Mr. Biden would respond. The video has now been seen four million times on Twitter.Another video from the Biden campaign alternates between playing footage of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden speaking about the coronavirus. “This moment calls for a president,” the video says at the end. “In November, you can elect one.”A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Matt Wolking, on Sunday accused Mr. Biden of seeking to use the coronavirus for “political gain at the exact moment the country needs optimism and unity.” “There will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at, because those background checks matter,” said Mr. Biden, who has gone through the process himself.

The video has now been seen four million times on Twitter.Another video from the Biden campaign alternates between playing footage of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden speaking about the coronavirus. “This moment calls for a president,” the video says at the end. “In November, you can elect one.”A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Matt Wolking, on Sunday accused Mr. Biden of seeking to use the coronavirus for “political gain at the exact moment the country needs optimism and unity.” “It’s also cowardly — because instead of showing his own face, Biden is having his advisers and allies do most of his dirty work for him,” he said.Sydney Ember and Katie Glueck contributed reporting. “It’s also cowardly — because instead of showing his own face, Biden is having his advisers and allies do most of his dirty work for him,” he said.Sydney Ember and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.",Biden Addresses a Visibility Question: ‘How Do We Get More of You?’,2020-03-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/biden-trump-coronavirus.html,new_york_times
"President Trump on Sunday night said that the government would reassess the recommended period for keeping businesses shut and millions of workers at home after this week, amid millions of job losses caused by the efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.“WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” Mr. Trump tweeted in all capital letters shortly before midnight. “AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!”Officials have said that the initial 15-day period for social distancing — limiting close contact between people by banning gatherings, closing schools and offices, encouraging remote work and urging people to maintain a six-foot distance from one another — is vital to slowing the spread of the virus, for which more than 30,000 people in the United States have tested positive. The 15-day period would end Monday.Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has said in interviews that he believed that it would take several more weeks until people can start going about their lives in a more normal fashion. Other infectious disease experts suggest even harsher measures than social distancing are required to truly beat back the outbreaks in the United States.

But at the White House, in recent days, there has been a growing sentiment that medical experts were allowed to set policy that has hurt the economy, and there has been a push to find ways to let people start returning to work. Some Republican lawmakers have also pleaded with the White House to find ways to restart the economy, as financial markets continue to slide and job losses for April could be in the millions.Vice President Mike Pence indicated on Sunday at a White House briefing about the virus that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would issue new guidelines on Monday, allowing some people who have been exposed to the coronavirus to resume working outside their homes if they wear masks.The move could set the stage for states with relatively low numbers of cases to begin to unfreeze their economies, while large states like California and New York — where there are more cases and where state officials have ordered nonessential businesses to close for the time being — could continue remaining in a holding pattern.

Mr. Trump’s tweet cast doubt on his confidence in the path to fighting the virus that he so reluctantly approved. For two months he largely dismissed the warnings that the virus would reach American shores, for fear of causing economic disruption, predicting that cases would go down from a handful to “zero” in a few days.Only when the disruption came anyway, in the form of a historic stock market sell-off, was he convinced to act.But there could be consequences to ending the measures too quickly. The recent rise of cases in Hong Kong, after there had been an easing of the spread of the virus, is something of an object lesson about how ending strict measures too soon can have dangerous consequences.In a tweet on Monday morning, Thomas Bossert, the former homeland security adviser who for weeks has been vocal about the need for the U.S. government to take stricter measures, said, “Sadly, the numbers now suggest the U.S. is poised to take the lead in #coronavirus cases. It’s reasonable to plan for the US to top the list of countries with the most cases in approximately 1 week. This does NOT make social intervention futile. It makes it imperative!”Whatever the president chooses to do, there will be businesses still fearful to reopen — and employees fearful of going to work — as new cases of people infected with the virus are still being diagnosed by the thousands each day.And the president is facing potential pushback from the public health experts in his administration.

After being slow to publicly react to the spread of the virus, the Trump administration swung in the other direction at the end of February, entrusting the health experts whose counsel had not been heeded in the preceding weeks and letting them help set the policies that hundreds of millions of people would be urged to follow.But Mr. Trump has become frustrated with Dr. Fauci’s blunt approach at the briefing lectern, which often contradicts things the president has just said, according to two people familiar with the dynamic.Mr. Trump knows that Dr. Fauci is seen as credible with a large swath of the public and with journalists, and so he has given him more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials. But the president has also resisted portraying the virus as an existential threat in a way that the public health experts have.In an interview with Science Magazine that was posted online on Sunday evening, Dr. Fauci responded to a question about how he had managed not to get fired by saying that, to Mr. Trump’s “credit, even though we disagree on some things, he listens.”“He goes his own way,” Dr. Fauci continued. “He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.”But he also said there was a limit to what he could do when Mr. Trump said things that were not true during those briefings.“I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Mr. Fauci said of Mr. Trump’s erroneous statements. “OK, he said it.

At the heart of the impasse is a $425 billion fund created by the bill that the Federal Reserve could leverage for loans to assist broad groups of distressed companies, and an additional $75 billion it would provide for industry-specific loans. Democrats have raised concerns that the funds do not have rules for transparency or enough guardrails to make sure companies do not use the funds to enrich themselves or take government money and lay off workers. They also argue the measure would give Mr. Mnuchin too much discretion to decide which companies receive the funds, calling the proposal a “slush fund” for the administration.As the legislation is currently written, Mr. Mnuchin would not have to disclose the recipients until six months after the loans were dispersed. Some Democrats also objected to loopholes in the legislation they said could allow Mr. Trump’s real estate empire to take advantage of the federal aid.The Democratic leader told reporters shortly after midnight that the bill as currently written would give bailouts to major corporations without accountability and that it would not provide enough funding to health care workers on the front lines. “We need this to pass today,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Fox Business Network on Monday, just before heading to Capitol Hill to meet with Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, to try to cement a deal.Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Schumer met late into the night on Sunday after the failed vote, but did not come to terms.

Ms. Klobuchar, writing in a post on Medium, said that she and her husband have been in different places for the past two weeks, and that because 14 days had elapsed since she saw him, she was following her doctor’s guidance and not getting a test for the virus while there is a shortage of tests in the country. “This bill is going to affect this country and the lives of Americans — not just for the next few days, but in the next few months and years,” Mr. Schumer said, “so we have to make sure it is good.” He said he hoped to have a compromise bill ready on Monday.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has scheduled three procedural votes at noon Eastern in an effort to intensify pressure on Democrats to cement an agreement.Also on Monday, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said that her husband, John Bessler, had tested positive for the coronavirus.

About 13 percent of the people who tested positive for the virus were hospitalized.Moving to stem the crisis on multiple fronts, Mr. Cuomo pleaded with federal officials to nationalize the manufacturing of medical supplies and ordered New York City to crack down on people congregating in public. He suggested that some streets could be closed to traffic, allowing pedestrians more space.The governor announced measures intended to prepare for a wave of patients, including setting up temporary hospitals in three New York City suburbs and erecting a large medical bivouac in the Jacob Javits Center on Manhattan’s West Side.Already, hospitals across the New York region are reporting a surge of coronavirus patients and a looming shortage of critical supplies like ventilators and masks.

Trump warns against letting the ‘cure’ become ‘worse than the problem itself.’ Trump warns against letting the ‘cure’ become ‘worse than the problem itself.’ As public health officials and leaders around the world braced their populations for a struggle that could continue for months, President Trump signaled that measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus could have their limits.“We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” he wrote on Twitter. “At the end of the 15 day period, we will make a decision which way we want to go!”Early last week, the White House released guidelines — effective for 15 days — urging Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and recommending that people work from home, avoid unnecessary shopping trips and refrain from eating in restaurants. Many states and cities have since imposed even stricter measures, with one in four people in America now under some form of restricted movement.The point of locking down entire cities and nations has been to give health care systems time to gear up so they do not find themselves overwhelmed by a surge of patients. And as the number of known cases in the United States crossed 31,700, governors from multiple states warned that they were still not ready.Mr. Trump said that major disaster declarations were in process for New York, California and Washington — the three states hardest hit by the virus — and that they would not have to pay for deploying National Guard units.

Mr. Trump also said he had directed FEMA to supply four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight stations with 2,000 beds for California, and seven stations with 1,000 beds for the state of Washington. The stations for New York, to be built in Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, were announced earlier in the day by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.Many state and local officials have pressed Mr. Trump to use his authority under the Defense Production Act to mobilize industry to manufacture scarce goods. At the news conference on Sunday, Mr. Trump defended his decision not to do so.“Call a person over in Venezuela,” he said. “Ask them: How did nationalization of their businesses work out? Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our businesses is not a good concept.” Mr. Trump also said he had directed FEMA to supply four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight stations with 2,000 beds for California, and seven stations with 1,000 beds for the state of Washington.

Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.Some of the medications are used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said. Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.Some of the medications are used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said. Among the drugs on the list was remdesivir, an experimental antiviral produced by Gilead Sciences that has been used in emergency cases to treat the coronavirus. But the company said on Sunday that it was suspending access to emergency requests for remdesivir, citing an “exponential increase” in such requests as the virus spreads through Europe and the United States.As coronavirus cases have increased around the world, demand has overwhelmed “an emergency treatment access system that was set up for very limited access to investigation medicines and never intended for use in response to a pandemic,” the company said in a statement. The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the website bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.Also on the list was chloroquine, a malaria medication that has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.

From India to Germany to Australia, world leaders have begun taking a harder line with people who violate the strict measures put in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.“I don’t know what they’re not understanding,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said about New Yorkers ignoring social distancing guidelines on Sunday. “This is not life as usual.”The U.S. surgeon general, Jerome Adams, warned on Monday in an appearance on NBC: “This week, it’s going to get bad.” He urged people in the country to stay at home.Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said on Sunday that if people didn’t comply with social distancing measures, he was ready to introduce “far more draconian measures,” after crowds thronged Australia’s beaches over the weekend.“Do what is right for our country,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told people in Germany on Sunday, after introducing measures that limit groups in public to just two people, aside from families — at a safe distance. “Show reason and heart,” she said.As increasingly drastic restrictions are introduced across the world, leaders are making it abundantly clear that while many people are complying, in order for social distancing to work, everyone has to limit interactions.Local leaders in some Italian towns and regions have taken to the streets to demand that residents return home and called out those who fail to adhere.

Vincenzo De Luca, the president of the regional government of Campania, issued a threat in a video message to those planning to throw graduation: “We will send the police over, with flamethrowers.” In some places, fines have been introduced for people who break the rules. In the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, people who unnecessarily leave their homes can face fines of up to 25,000 euros, about $26,700.Alain Thirion, a top security official at France’s interior ministry, told reporters in Paris on Sunday that the police had carried out checks on over 1.7 million people and that over 90,000 of them were in violation of a mandatory lockdown. Repeat offenders could face up to €3,700 in fines and six months in prison, under legislation passed on Sunday by France’s Parliament.Chinese officials appear to disagree on whether to push a conspiracy theory about the U.S. Vincenzo De Luca, the president of the regional government of Campania, issued a threat in a video message to those planning to throw graduation: “We will send the police over, with flamethrowers.” In some places, fines have been introduced for people who break the rules.

In the interview with Axios, the Chinese ambassador, Mr. Cui, reiterated his criticism of people in the United States who were promoting unproven theories about the virus. “This is the job for the scientists to do, not for diplomats, not for journalists to speculate,” he said. “Because such speculation will help nobody. It’s very harmful.”But he deflected questions about Mr. Zhao’s remarks, saying it wasn’t his job to explain the view of his colleague.The fringe theories on the virus’s origins first came to the fore last month when Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas claimed that the deadly coronavirus, which first emerged in Wuhan, was manufactured by the Chinese government. In a February interview on “Face the Nation,” Mr. Cui called such claims “crazy.” He said other rumors asserting that the virus had originated from an American military laboratory were similarly unbelievable.A little joy in a difficult time.

"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland. Mr. Trump’s decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day. Mr. Trump’s decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day. In taking over the White House, Mr. Meadows, 60, a retiring Republican from North Carolina, becomes Mr. Trump’s fourth chief of staff in 38 months, the most that any president has had in such a short time. His arrival almost surely signals more changes to follow, as most of Mr. Mulvaney’s deputies and others on his team are expected to leave, too, possibly including Emma Doyle, his top lieutenant, and Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser.

Hope Hicks, one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted advisers, returns on Monday in a new role working for Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Mulvaney, who technically retained his post as budget director while serving as acting chief of staff, will surrender that, too, and the acting director, Russell T. Vought, appears poised to take the job permanently, an appointment he has quietly lobbied for for months.The change has been a long time coming. The president soured on Mr. Mulvaney a while ago but was warned by advisers not to get rid of him until after his Senate trial, which ended with Mr. Trump’s acquittal on Feb. 6. Throughout the impeachment battle, Mr. Mulvaney was at near-open war with the White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone, at one point seen as a potential successor as chief of staff.Mr. Mulvaney had increasingly been on the losing side of policy battles and appeared less often at Mr. Trump’s side. Some saw a sign of impending dismissal last month at the wedding of Stephen Miller, the president’s senior adviser, and Katie Waldman, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump sat with Mr. Meadows and his wife along with other advisers at one table, while Mr. Mulvaney was left at a lower-tier table, according to a witness. Wedding guests whispered about the optics of the scene, right in front of so many people.

Mr. Trump called Mr. Meadows on Thursday to offer him the job, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Mr. Mulvaney, who took an annual trip to Nevada this week, learned of the decision on Friday, another person familiar with the events said. Mr. Mulvaney did not travel with Mr. Trump to Florida; instead, he sent Ms. Doyle.The president wanted to announce the news on Twitter earlier in the day, but ended up waiting until after a day of travel to Tennessee to survey tornado damage and to Georgia to tour the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to another person close to the situation. Some aides assumed he would therefore wait until Sunday and were taken off-guard at the Friday night tweet.The replacement was widely seen in the West Wing as a chance for the president to reinvigorate his staff, over which Mr. Mulvaney was seen as losing control. Some of the president’s conservative advisers, including Fox News hosts, had been pressing him to replace Mr. Mulvaney.In Mr. Meadows, Mr. Trump will have an ally he considers a confidant and bellwether of congressional conservatives. “I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At a closed-door fund-raiser on Friday evening, he told donors that Mr. Meadows would be “my James Baker,” according to a person in the room, referring to the chief of staff to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Baker is generally considered the gold standard in the post.In a statement of his own, Mr. Meadows praised Mr. Mulvaney for doing “a great job,” adding, “This president and his administration have a long list of incredible victories they’ve delivered to the country during this first term, with the best yet to come.”A founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Meadows has been one of the president’s most ardent defenders. For months during the impeachment battle, Mr. Meadows was a ubiquitous face on television arguing forcefully that the president had done nothing wrong, appearances that cemented his relationship with Mr. Trump.First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows announced in December that he did not plan to seek re-election, hinting at the time that he might work for Mr. Trump in some capacity. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said.

Mr. Mulvaney, 52, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, served as chief of staff for more than 14 months in an “acting” capacity without ever formally being given the title. Mr. Mulvaney brushed off the snub by telling people that everyone in Mr. Trump’s White House was effectively in the job on an acting basis, but the seeming lack of faith or respect invariably made it harder for him to impose authority.Witnesses placed Mr. Mulvaney at the heart of the events that led to Mr. Trump’s impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to incriminate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney carried out Mr. Trump’s order to suspend $391 million in aid to Ukraine, an action declared illegal by the Government Accountability Office. Some advisers later told the president that Mr. Mulvaney had helped ensnare him in impeachment, even though he was following Mr. Trump’s wishes.At a news briefing in October, Mr. Mulvaney contradicted the president’s denial that he had imposed a quid pro quo on the assistance to benefit his own political fortunes. Mr. Mulvaney told reporters that the White House had withheld aid to Ukraine in part to force Kyiv to commit to investigating a widely debunked theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of the Democrats, a story that American intelligence agencies have called Russian disinformation.“Absolutely. No question about that,” Mr. Mulvaney said. He added, “That’s why we held up the money. ”Later that afternoon, Mr. Mulvaney issued a written statement trying to take it back, denying any quid pro quo between the aid and the investigation.The conflicting statements bolstered Democratic critics and dismayed Republican defenders, who were relying on his assurances that the aid suspension was not tied to his demands that Ukraine investigate Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney defied a House subpoena to testify, but House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump in the Senate played his comments from the briefing repeatedly as part of their case.Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, told House investigators last fall that Mr. Mulvaney had been involved in arranging a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that was tied to whether he would conduct the investigations sought by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. She testified that Mr. Mulvaney was working with Gordon D. Sondland, who was then the ambassador to the European Union.

Bolton, then the president’s national security adviser, was alarmed at the machinations and ordered Ms. Hill to report the matter to a White House lawyer. “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” Mr. Bolton told her to tell the lawyer.Unlike his predecessor John F. Kelly, a retired Marine general who left in late 2018, Mr. Mulvaney made a point of not trying to control the famously mercurial president and instead let Trump be Trump. Mr. Kelly said in October, as the House was pursuing its Ukraine inquiry, that he had previously warned the president that such an approach would mean that “you will be impeached.”As Mr. Trump’s first budget director, Mr. Mulvaney helped enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, the president’s signature legislative victory, and rolled back environmental and other regulations. But he was frustrated in his attempts to pare back spending and wound up presiding over a period of rocketing budget deficits that are projected to top $1 trillion a year for the next decade.During Mr. Mulvaney’s time as acting chief of staff, the economy remained strong, and by the end of his tenure, Mr. Trump’s approval rating had risen to 49 percent in Gallup’s poll, the highest of his presidency. He made a point of using Camp David to build ties with lawmakers and aides who otherwise previously felt neglected.Mr. Mulvaney recently told an audience in Britain that he regularly conflicted with the president over various decisions but made a point of keeping that private. “I disagree with the president every single day,” he said. “You just don’t hear about it — that’s not my job.”Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman from New York, and Annie Karni, Katie Rogers, Michael D.

"President Trump claimed again on Friday that anyone who needed a coronavirus test “gets a test.” But from Washington State to Florida to New York, doctors and patients are clamoring for tests that they say are in woefully short supply, and their frustration is mounting alongside the growing number of cases around the country.In California, where thousands are being monitored for the virus, only 516 tests had been conducted by the state as of Thursday. Washington health officials have more cases than they can currently process. And in New York, where cases have quadrupled this week, a New York City official pleaded for more test kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The slow federal action on this matter has impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic,” the official said in a letter Friday.More than 300 cases have been confirmed, at least 17 have died, and thousands are in self-quarantine. Public health officials are warning that no one knows how deeply the virus will spread, in part because the federal government’s flawed rollout of tests three weeks ago has snowballed into an embarrassing fiasco of national proportions.

Public health officials are warning that no one knows how deeply the virus will spread, in part because the federal government’s flawed rollout of tests three weeks ago has snowballed into an embarrassing fiasco of national proportions. The latest two deaths were announced late Friday night in Florida, marking the first time fatal cases were not on the West Coast.In the last week, Mr. Trump and his top officials repeatedly promised that 1 million to 1.5 million tests would be sent around the country, even though labs — government and private ones alike — have struggled to get the tests running amid a growing number of infections and rising demand for tests. Despite an order Wednesday by the C.D.C. to greatly expand criteria for who can be tested, many hospitals and state health authorities continued to limit tests to those at the highest risk for infection, adding to the confusion and frustration, especially in hot spots like California and Washington.In California, Cindy Homen, 58, followed the advice she had heard from public health officials this week and emailed her primary care doctor about getting tested, at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Santa Rosa, Calif., when she started to come down with coughing fits and a sore throat.She received a reply Thursday telling her she did not need to get tested, that most people exposed to the virus recover after experiencing mild symptoms. She was advised to wash her hands and stay home. “At this point, testing is very limited,” her doctor wrote.“This whole thing is just a big joke,” Ms. Homen said. “How do they track the coronavirus if there aren’t enough test kits and they don’t even want you to come in?” The latest two deaths were announced late Friday night in Florida, marking the first time fatal cases were not on the West Coast.In the last week, Mr. Trump and his top officials repeatedly promised that 1 million to 1.5 million tests would be sent around the country, even though labs — government and private ones alike — have struggled to get the tests running amid a growing number of infections and rising demand for tests.

On Friday, Mr. Pence said it would be a “matter of weeks” before Americans could get easy access to a coronavirus test.And on Thursday, he seemed to acknowledge that the administration’s estimates were high. Speaking at a 3M plant in Minnesota where another item in short supply — respirator masks — are made, he said, “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.” Mr. Pence added: “For those who we believe have been exposed, for those who are showing symptoms, we’ve been able to provide the testing.”On Friday, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, was prompted to speak by the president at the White House signing of the $8.3 billion emergency spending bill for the coronavirus. Mr. Azar told reporters: “I just want to make it clear that in terms of tests, we have provided all the tests to the state of Washington and the state of California that they’ve asked for. The production and shipping of tests that we’ve talked about all week is completely on schedule.” Over the past few days, Vice President Mike Pence has been moderating expectations about how quickly the tests would be widely available.

In addition, he said, Integrated DNA Technologies, the private contractor working with the C.D.C. to ship to the private sector and hospitals, has already distributed enough materials for 700,000 tests.

At a short news conference during the president’s visit to the C.D.C. lab in Atlanta on Friday, Dr. Robert R.

They have the tests and the tests are beautiful.” But states and public health experts are warning that access is still limited and varies from state to state, hampering the ability to know how far the virus has spread or for how long it has gone undetected in some regions of the country.“We’re going to need millions and millions and millions of tests,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a CNN town hall Thursday. But states and public health experts are warning that access is still limited and varies from state to state, hampering the ability to know how far the virus has spread or for how long it has gone undetected in some regions of the country.“We’re going to need millions and millions and millions of tests,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a CNN town hall Thursday. After weeks of delays by the C.D.C. because of a “manufacturing problem"" in one component of its test, and the Food and Drug Administration’s refusal to lift testing restrictions for large academic centers or private companies until Feb. 29, many laboratories have begun to process tests only in the last few days. There still is no central reporting system to track the number of tests conducted or the number of patients who have been tested.[Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic here.]It is nearly impossible to know precisely how many people in the United States have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. reported Thursday that it had tested 1,583 patients since the beginning of the outbreak, but it is not making public how many tests are being done at state and local public health laboratories, despite publishing similar data on the seasonal flu. Many local labs are just beginning to receive long-delayed test kits and, even at full capacity, will be able to run only about 100 tests per day.A total of 71 public laboratories in 47 states and the District of Columbia had the capacity to test for the coronavirus as of Friday afternoon, according to the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents government laboratories around the country. That’s up from just eight labs able to process tests last Thursday.“We’ve seen major progress with essentially the lights coming on across the country,” said Scott Becker, the association’s chief executive. After weeks of delays by the C.D.C. because of a “manufacturing problem"" in one component of its test, and the Food and Drug Administration’s refusal to lift testing restrictions for large academic centers or private companies until Feb. 29, many laboratories have begun to process tests only in the last few days. There still is no central reporting system to track the number of tests conducted or the number of patients who have been tested.[Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic here.]It is nearly impossible to know precisely how many people in the United States have been tested for the coronavirus.

But the delays mean that “we’re absolutely a few weeks behind where we should be,” he said, adding, “There is no way you can sugarcoat that.”Maine said it was still bringing its state laboratory online. Pennsylvania officials said they would have the capacity to test 150 specimens a day at the state laboratory beginning this weekend. Arkansas can process eight to 10 tests daily, and has so far tested six patients.Large, private laboratories are also ramping up. LabCorp, a major diagnostics company, began offering a coronavirus test Thursday evening. Another firm, Quest Diagnostics, said it would launch a similar product on Monday.“The reason that’s important, the reason that meets future demand is because the enormous capacity of these commercial laboratories and others in the country are precisely how we will make coronavirus tests available for your local doctor, available to your pharmacy and broadly available to the American public,” Mr. Pence said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing Friday.But Wendy Bost, a Quest spokeswoman, sounded a more cautious tone. “While we believe we have capacity to accommodate initial demand, this is an evolving situation and we anticipate building additional capacity over time,” she said in a statement.

Dr. Alex Greninger, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak, said the university’s lab had tested about 400 patients since it set up operations earlier this week under new federal guidelines. The lab can yield results in about eight hours and is testing patients from several hospitals around Washington State. “I’m entirely focused on testing and building out operations that can handle thousands of tests a day,” he said.

Meanwhile, the state laboratories in Washington have more cases than they can currently process.“We have a small backlog that we hope to be through very soon,” said Danielle Koenig, a spokeswoman for that state’s health department. The agency had tested 91 patients as of Wednesday, and attributed the backlog to both a lack of staffing and physical capacity. Their facilities can currently handle 200 samples per day, with each patient requiring between one and three tests.In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis cautioned that the state had not yet received enough testing kits. “I know they have tens of thousands that will eventually be en route,” he said. “We’d like to get them, obviously, as soon as possible.”So far, the state is conducting tests at three public health labs in Miami, Tampa and Jacksonville.The C.D.C.’s decision to remove most criteria for testing took some state officials and large health systems off-guard.“Everyone under the sun who is going to develop a cough is going to want to get a test for coronavirus,” Dr. Mark Levine, the commissioner of Vermont’s health department, said on the day the changes were announced. On Friday, Vermont health officials said they had run eight tests in the state. Many states reported on Friday that they had run only a handful of tests.In several states, health officials have been sending out guidance to physicians encouraging them to first test for other likely causes, such as the flu, before sending samples to state laboratories.

Mr. Becker, of the public health lab association, said he worried that mixed messages from the Trump administration could create demand for testing that “has the potential to overwhelm the public health system, and the country.”In Colorado, Scott Bookman, the incident commander overseeing the coronavirus for the state’s health department, warned: “We don’t have unlimited supply going forward, so we want to be careful with that.”Mr. Bookman said Colorado had tested samples from 100 patients, and its lab could test samples for 160 patients per day, if needed. State health officials announced Colorado’s first two infections on Thursday, with additional cases on Friday.Utah, where one patient has been treated for coronavirus, can test about 30 people daily. That’s enough to keep up with current demand but there are potential bottlenecks: Parts of the test are conducted manually, and supplies that come from outside vendors may become scarce.“We’re not turning away tests, but our capacity right now is limited by the fact that we have a human being extracting the DNA,” said Jenny Johnson, a Utah spokeswoman.

Dr. John Strayer, an emergency doctor at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, Wash., where some of the patients infected with the virus had been admitted, said the loosened criteria have “added to my work.”He said he now has to triage patients based on whether they were sick enough to need a test urgently. Most people are sent back home and told to quarantine until they get better.Dr. Strayer said the new policy had certainly created “lots of very angry patients.”Kate Mannle, 37, of Seattle spent a week trying to get tested. Ms. Mannle returned Saturday from an overseas trip that included a layover in South Korea, which is experiencing an outbreak of the new virus. On Sunday, she developed a fever and a cough, but was told by her doctor and hospitals that she was not sick enough to get tested.Ms. Mannle, the director of training programs for a conservation nonprofit, quarantined herself inside her one-bedroom apartment in Seattle, where she spent the week sleeping, doing a little yoga and trying to recover from her 101-degree fever and respiratory infection. She plans to stay inside until 24 to 48 hours after her cough goes away. She suspects she did indeed contract the virus, but she will probably never know for sure.“They’ve put up so many barriers,” she said. “I’m tired of it and I’m ready to move on.” She added: “But what about the next one?

"Bernie Sanders was several takes into a video delivering a message he desperately needed to convey last fall — that he was healthy enough to soldier on after his heart attack — when his team realized something was not clicking.You have to tell people how you really feel, one aide chimed in, according to a person who worked on the shoot. The heart attack not only deepened your commitment to health reform, the aide said; it was personal.Public introspection is not Mr. Sanders’s go-to move. But he gave it a shot. Near the end of the seven-minute video posted on his Instagram account in October, after swipes at “corporate media” and a pitch for “Medicare for All,” the candidate haltingly admitted that his hospitalization had indeed prompted him to take stock.

But is there a deeper layer, a “real” Bernie the public does not get to see?People who have known Mr. Sanders for years say that, if anything, he is more intense and can be insensitive to people who encounter his moods — in other words, even more Bernie than Bernie. Being around Mr. Sanders, they say, is to watch him endlessly wind himself up and back down, long periods of tension punctuated by brief, welcome intervals of calm.Within hours of having two cardiac stents installed after his heart attack, the senator was back on the phone with senior aides in Washington, grilling them on proposed staff hires, dictating media strategy and asking for details of an advertising buy, aides said.That intensity can sometimes cross the line.

In the run-up to the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Tad Devine, then a senior campaign adviser, pressured Mr. Sanders to commission a survey gauging his strengths and weaknesses. The candidate reluctantly agreed.A few days later, Mr. Sanders exploded at Mr. Devine when a journalist obtained a leaked recording of the questions. “What did you do? You are trying to destroy my reputation and my image!” Mr. Sanders shouted at the adviser, bursting through the closed door of his office in Des Moines, according to a witness.Even his amusements seem to be in character. He uses an iPad (not a phone) to devour social media and news, and loves to watch old boxing matches and movies like “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Melancholia,” a 2011 dystopian drama that ends with the obliteration of the Earth. He sings along, tunelessly, with 1960s and 1970s folk rock on car radios, takes long walks with his wife and adores his grandchildren.

Mostly, he works.“He is always working and looking to move the ball forward, even when he is having a casual conversation,” said Michaeleen Crowell, the former chief of staff in his Senate office. “It’s hard for him to take time off for himself. He’s happiest when he’s working.”A ‘Lone Ranger’ Finds AlliesIn January, Hillary Clinton, who believes Mr. Sanders’s refusal to quickly exit the 2016 primaries damaged her cause, made news with her comment that “nobody likes” Mr. Sanders in the Senate — ushering in a debate over whether he was simply too abrasive to get elected.The claim was not entirely baseless. Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, was deeply unpopular for many of his 16 years in the House of Representatives, where he bucked his own leadership and pelted bills with amendments, many of the gadfly variety.“He was like a lone ranger,” Representative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat who is one of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s closest allies, said in an interview last summer. She called his record “thin.”But the Senate has a higher threshold for grandstanding and eccentricity, so Mr. Sanders, who forged an alliance with the former majority leader Harry Reid, found a more forgiving crowd. He is less disliked than seen as a loner prone to delivering irritating sermons, fellow senators said.“No, people don’t hate Bernie,” said a Democratic senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I’d say the feeling is closer to resentment, because some of us have to take the tough votes on things so he can keep his brand pure.”As a boss, Mr. Sanders is notoriously tough. Former aides have described him as demanding and particular, sometimes to a fault.

Mr. Sanders “never makes you feel like you’re good enough to be in the room with him,” one former aide said. When an appearance at a rally in New Hampshire last fall was delayed, an impatient Mr. Sanders brushed past an organizer and barked: “I’m the candidate, not you. I’m going on,” according to a person backstage.More serious outbursts are rare, and Mr. Sanders doesn’t tend to take pushback personally, several former aides said. Mr. Devine, who declined to comment, gave back as good as he got in the exchange, according to a person who was in the room.Mr. Sanders denies that he has ever been an abusive boss, but allows that he can be difficult to work with, and has attributed his impatience to his own sense that he is falling short of his own high expectations.“Look, I don’t tolerate [expletive] terribly well,” he told the New York Times editorial board in December. “I’m not good at backslapping. I’m not good at pleasantries. If you have your birthday, I’m not going to call you up to congratulate you, so you’ll love me and you’ll write nice things about me.”He has virtually no tolerance for small talk. Steve Slavin, a high school friend of his and later his college roommate, recalled the day in 2008 when Mr. Sanders invited him to speak at his enshrinement on James Madison High School’s Wall of Distinction. After a luncheon for the honorees, the two made their way to the auditorium, taking seats together in the front row.

As they waited, Mr. Sanders did not say a word to him and instead spent the time writing notes on a piece of paper, silently.“He was scribbling away what he was going to say,” Mr. Slavin said in an interview. “We didn’t talk at all.”Creature ComfortsThough he can be difficult, with a stubborn streak that can exasperate, close friends and allies have learned to adjust. Perhaps that is why his innermost circle is so small, made up of his wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders; Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager; Warren Gunnels, his Senate policy director; and a pair of Burlington buddies, Huck Gutman and Richard Sugarman.Mr. Weaver said in early 2019 that he would not oversee Mr. Sanders’s 2020 run, after several staff members on the 2016 campaign came forward with claims that incidents of sexism and harassment were not appropriately addressed. But Mr. Sanders never had any intention of sidelining his close friend, and Mr. Weaver remains as influential as ever, according to campaign aides.The candidate’s need to control his surroundings also extends to the physical environment. He hates the cramped hassle of flying commercial, aides say, even if going private doesn’t entirely comport with his brand.For years, Mr. Sanders’s staff members have compiled hotel dos and don’ts for a man who rises early but sometimes finds it hard to fall asleep. The list, distributed to aides in his entourage and shared with hotel employees, stipulates that his room must be kept at an arctic 60 degrees. That he needs an oscillating fan. Other wish lists have requested that written materials be removed. That the room must be at least five doors away from the ice machine and from the elevator, though the walk to the elevator must not be too long.

That was just a starting point, according to aides who went along on Mr. Sanders’s weeklong tour with the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, in 2017. The morning before he was to arrive a hotel in Las Vegas, his staff summoned the hotel engineer to jury-rig the air-conditioner to the required temperature.There was one more problem: Someone had to stay in the room to keep a motion sensor from kicking the thermostat back to 72 degrees. A representative of the Sanders team looked hopefully at a Perez aide, who declined to volunteer. (A Sanders spokesman did not deny the episode, but was skeptical anyone would be asked to do such a thing.)Friends emphasize that Mr. Sanders does not demand star treatment (he routinely rejects upgrades from singles to suites, aides said). It is just that he craves peace and solitude, often to collect his thoughts and catalog them on his ever-present yellow legal pad.The heart attack limited another form of relaxation: eating. Mr. Sanders has been trying to shift to berries, grains and smoothies, but he leans toward heartier stuff — spare ribs, steaks, cheesecake, fried chicken, fried rice, bacon and eggs. He proposed to his wife outside a Burlington Friendly’s after polishing off a hot fudge sundae.Unwinding is not easy for Mr. Sanders under any circumstances, but he seems most likely to let his guard down around children. As he awaited the results of the New Hampshire primary, he wandered the halls of an airport hotel in Manchester with his grandchildren, a person on his staff said, introducing them to campaign aides and giving them a guided tour of vending machines and conference rooms.Randy Bryce, a Sanders campaign surrogate from Wisconsin, remembered going on a campaign swing with Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire last year. He had brought his 13-year-old son, and the three of them, along with Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, grabbed lunch at a coffee shop.At one point, Mr. Bryce got up; when he returned to the table, he saw Mr. Sanders smuggling chips to his son. “Don’t tell your dad I’m giving you all my chips,” Mr. Sanders said loud enough for Mr. Bryce to hear.

As he awaited the results of the New Hampshire primary, he wandered the halls of an airport hotel in Manchester with his grandchildren, a person on his staff said, introducing them to campaign aides and giving them a guided tour of vending machines and conference rooms.Randy Bryce, a Sanders campaign surrogate from Wisconsin, remembered going on a campaign swing with Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire last year. He had brought his 13-year-old son, and the three of them, along with Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, grabbed lunch at a coffee shop.At one point, Mr. Bryce got up; when he returned to the table, he saw Mr. Sanders smuggling chips to his son. “Don’t tell your dad I’m giving you all my chips,” Mr. Sanders said loud enough for Mr. Bryce to hear. Later, speaking at a union dinner, Mr. Sanders introduced Mr. Bryce’s son in front of everyone. “My son will never forget that,” Mr. Bryce said. “It was very touching.”Ms. Crowell, Mr. Sanders’s former Senate aide, said his favorite event each year was a summer barbecue in his Burlington backyard that culminated in a Wiffle ball game with the senator as pitcher. One memory, from a few years back: Her son, then a preteen, connected with a Sanders pitch and rocketed a line drive that barely missed the boss’s head. “I looked over, and Bernie has got this huge smile on his face,” she said.Mr. Sanders’s own childhood in stoop-ball-era Brooklyn was, by his own accounts, a painful one, and he has been candid in his memoirs about the lingering impact of the turbulence. He grew up with his brother, Larry, in a household chronically short of money, riven by fighting between his father, Eli, a paint salesman, and his mother, Dorothy, who died when he was 18.Those experiences are never far from his mind, friends say. During a trip to New York in 2013, before he was a national celebrity, Mr. Sanders headed to Midwood to check out his old apartment building on East 26th Street, according to an aide who accompanied him.Like any self-respecting Brooklynite, he defeated the buzzer lock by politely holding the door open for someone who was exiting the building. But once he got upstairs, he could not persuade the tenant to let him in.Mr. Sanders would not be stopped. With a dart, he stuck his head inside the doorway, peered around, absorbed it all, thanked the woman and headed back downstairs.

"Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign organization in key Super Tuesday states was so flimsy that it shocked and alarmed Democratic Party leaders. Mr. Biden had little cash for advertising on the airwaves. His message just days before the big vote was sometimes unfocused and meandering.But when 14 states voted on Tuesday, none of that mattered: Mr. Biden swept to victory in 10 of them, reflecting a quickly coalescing moderate wing of the Democratic Party and a desperation among voters to start taking the fight to President Trump.“There’s no analogous situation that I can think of in presidential politics where a candidate who was really on the brink of extinction came back and, over four days, took command of a race without benefit of media or organization,” said David Axelrod, who served as chief strategist for President Barack Obama. “It’s an unparalleled situation.”Mr. Biden was greatly aided by the late endorsements of two former rivals, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who exited the race at the beginning of the week. Mr. Biden’s overwhelming victory in South Carolina last Saturday, powered by African-American voters, injected a stunning dose of momentum into the campaign after losses in the first three nominating contests.

But Tuesday’s results also showed that in a matchup that was largely against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the less quantifiable elements of Mr. Biden’s campaign — his association with Mr. Obama, his empathy and his more moderate approach to governing — outweighed his lack of organizational heft in many places.Those operational challenges have not evaporated. Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had “virtually no operation” in his state, which votes on Tuesday.Yet as the presidential contest moves into a battle for large, delegate-rich states like Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Florida, Mr. Biden is racing to cement his advantage with the sprawling coalition that propelled him in the past week — this time with the momentum, money and avalanche of endorsements that had eluded him throughout the race, even as his team scrambles to scale up.Headed into the next round of contests on Tuesday, when six states including Michigan and Missouri will vote, Mr. Biden is again seeking to run up the score in heavily African-American congressional districts, build on his newfound strength with moderate suburbanites and fight Mr. Sanders for white working-class voters. He is quickly rerouting some staff to key states, uncorking new ad spending and leaning into sharper criticisms of Mr. Sanders, now his chief rival for the nomination.Mr. Biden’s financial fortunes are rapidly changing: Since last Saturday, the day of his resounding victory in South Carolina, his campaign has raised more than $22 million in online donations — more than double its total fund-raising in the entire month of January.

Mr. Biden’s surrogates have sprung into action, seeking to help him acquire additional support in upcoming key states through methods both traditional — Ms. Klobuchar deployed to Michigan for Mr. Biden — and creative: The former U.S. ambassador to Ireland was listed as hosting an organizing event recently for Mr. Biden in the small city of Bolivar, Mo.According to his campaign, Mr. Biden has more than 70 endorsements in Missouri, more than 50 in Florida and around 20 in Michigan. Among his newest endorsers in Michigan is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was named a national co-chair of his campaign.Former Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had focused resources on South Carolina out of necessity. But with an eye on the March 17 contest in his own state, Mr. Nelson said, “Now I think you will see a flood of people that will be coming in and augmenting the existing staff in Florida.”“People like a winner,” added Mr. Nelson, who has been pounding the phones, seeking to get more state legislators on board.Still, there is limited time to build out the kind of on-the-ground infrastructure that can often make a difference in close races.In Michigan, Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, another Biden supporter, said the Biden campaign was relying on volunteers, and had long made clear that it did not intend to establish a large presence of paid staff in the state.“They flat-out said we’re not putting field resources in Michigan,” he said, noting that he agreed with their approach. “I told them we’d do the organizing with the volunteers here and we’d be ready to go on March 10, and I think we will be.” Mr. Biden’s surrogates have sprung into action, seeking to help him acquire additional support in upcoming key states through methods both traditional — Ms. Klobuchar deployed to Michigan for Mr. Biden — and creative: The former U.S. ambassador to Ireland was listed as hosting an organizing event recently for Mr. Biden in the small city of Bolivar, Mo.According to his campaign, Mr. Biden has more than 70 endorsements in Missouri, more than 50 in Florida and around 20 in Michigan.

In contrast to 2016, Washington and Idaho Democrats have now embraced primaries — not caucuses, which tend to draw only the most committed activists — a move that some Biden allies hope will allow him to cut into Mr. Sanders’s potential advantages in those states, both of which he won handily in the previous presidential race.On Thursday, Mr. Sanders canceled a rally in Mississippi, a state with a heavily African-American Democratic electorate, redeploying instead to delegate-heavy Michigan, where he and Mr. Biden look poised for a fierce fight over the blue-collar workers that helped Mr. Sanders narrowly win the state in his 2016 presidential bid.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have criticized each other during the primary race — over Mr. Biden’s vote to authorize the war in Iraq, for example, or Mr. Sanders’s record on gun control — but they now both appear willing to wage their most pointed fights to date. Mr. Sanders has released ads jabbing Mr. Biden over his position on trade and his past support at times for Social Security freezes — reviving a fight the two men had in Iowa that Mr. Sanders’s allies believe played to his advantage.Mr. Sanders also released an ad highlighting his ties to Mr. Obama, a move that drew incredulity from some of Mr. Biden’s supporters who note not only Mr. Biden’s service as vice president under Mr. Obama, but also that Mr. Sanders reportedly weighed a primary challenge to Mr. Obama in the 2012 election.

The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday.

Recognizing the stakes here, Mr. Sanders is assailing Mr. Biden for his support of what he called “disastrous trade agreements like Nafta.” And his campaign is airing a commercial in the manufacturing-heavy state that features a former autoworker highlighting the former vice president’s lack of regret for supporting the pact while pointing out that Mr. Sanders has opposed free trade deals.

As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.

While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said former Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.” While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election.

And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals.

It is clear why Mr. Sanders is scrambling — the Super Tuesday results carried ominous signs for his candidacy. In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.

Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest.

But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Saturday continued sending contradictory signals about its response to the coronavirus, as a top federal health official appeared to walk back President Trump’s claim that “anyone who wants a test can get a test.”The health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, cautioned that only those who have gone through a doctor or medical professional can be approved for a test, a message that appeared to undercut Mr. Trump, who delivered his promise on Friday as he toured the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test,” Mr. Azar said at an off-camera briefing at the White House. “That is our medical system in the United States, in the same way that you may not get a cardiac medicine if your doctor doesn’t prescribe that.”Mr. Azar’s comments were another instance of key officials in recent days correcting or clarifying Mr. Trump, who has sought to project calm and preparedness as the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States. More than 100 new cases were announced in the United States on Saturday, including two deaths in Washington State and dozens of new cases in New York State.

More than 100 new cases were announced in the United States on Saturday, including two deaths in Washington State and dozens of new cases in New York State. The communications clash between the president and top officials overseeing the federal government’s response to the coronavirus could obscure valuable knowledge about it, said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the author of “The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide: Leadership and Management in Trying Times.”“Things change in a crisis — the advice may change in a crisis,” said Dr. Sharfstein, a former top F.D.A. official who teaches a class on the topic at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And so it’s really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice.”Mr. Azar on Saturday defended Mr. Trump’s phrasing, saying it reflected a recent shift by federal health agencies, which have loosened testing regulations. The C.D.C on Wednesday lifted all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus.

“What the president said yesterday at the C.D.C., that is consistent with what the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. are saying, which is we as regulators, or as those shipping the test, are not restricting who can get tested,” Mr. Azar said. “We are leaving that to the professional judgment of doctors and public health officials.”Mr. Trump used “shorthand” to make that point, Mr. Azar said.“What he meant to say is we’re not in the way of that,” Mr. Azar said. “And he knows the numbers. We brief him daily.” The communications clash between the president and top officials overseeing the federal government’s response to the coronavirus could obscure valuable knowledge about it, said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the author of “The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide: Leadership and Management in Trying Times.”“Things change in a crisis — the advice may change in a crisis,” said Dr. Sharfstein, a former top F.D.A. official who teaches a class on the topic at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And so it’s really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice.”Mr. Azar on Saturday defended Mr. Trump’s phrasing, saying it reflected a recent shift by federal health agencies, which have loosened testing regulations. The C.D.C on Wednesday lifted all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus.

We brief him daily.” Mr. Azar’s assertion echoed one made by Vice President Mike Pence at a White House news conference Friday evening, in which the vice president said that doctors treating potentially symptomatic Americans could contact local officials and have state labs do the testing.During a visit to the mask producer 3M in Minnesota on Thursday, Mr. Pence acknowledged the constraints of testing. “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,” he said.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has remained publicly upbeat, minimizing the potential consequences of the virus, which he has said could disappear this spring in warmer weather. “A vast majority are going to be fine,” the president said on Friday about Americans who have the virus, portraying it as similar to the flu.“I’m not concerned at all,” the president said on Saturday when asked about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House.In private, White House officials have cast Mr. Azar as “alarmist.”On Friday, Mr. Trump characterized the government’s testing aptitude as “amazing” and called the C.D.C.’s test “perfect,” statements that have been roundly disputed by scientists and health officials who have expressed alarm over the speed with which the C.D.C. has tested and over the quality of its tests.Consistent messaging, Dr. Sharfstein said, helps with the “fear of the unknown.”“Testing is a more confusing topic than it can seem,” he said. “People can be overly reassured by a negative test or overly panicked by a positive test. Having a thoughtful approach to testing is important.”The number of people who can be tested for the coronavirus and the number of tests available are fluid, federal officials said on Saturday at the White House briefing.

Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, said that 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private health labs as of Friday evening, and hundreds of thousands more were being surveyed for quality at the C.D.C. on Saturday. He said that between public health labs and C.D.C. tests, the total number of samples that have been tested was over 5,860.

Pressed over whether an ill person who consults a doctor and is recommended for a test can get one in a timely way, Mr. Azar said on Saturday that “there’s no reason that should not happen.”Doctors and patients across the nation have painted a much different picture of availability, clamoring for tests they believe are in short supply. In California, only 516 tests had been conducted as of Thursday. Health officials in Washington State have more cases than they can currently process. In New York City, officials have pleaded for more test kits from the C.D.C.State officials facing a growing number of cases criticized the Trump administration this weekend for what they described as its contradictions. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that he was “battling” mixed messages from the federal government.“You have the president saying anybody who wants a test can have a test, it’s beautiful,” he said on MSNBC. “You have the vice president saying we can’t do the tests. We don’t have the capacity.”“That confusion, I think, adds to the fear and the frustration of people, because if government doesn’t know what it’s doing, well then people feel they’re really alone,” Mr. Cuomo added.

After Mr. Pence visited Washington State this week to signal the administration’s support for the state, where 14 deaths have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle area, he praised its governor, Jay Inslee. Mr. Trump then called Mr. Inslee a “snake.”“Let me just tell you we have a lot of problems with the governor,” Mr. Trump said in Atlanta on Friday. “So Mike may be happy with him, but I’m not, OK?”Mr. Inslee wrote on Twitter that it was “important for leaders to speak with one voice.”“I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page,” he said.Mr. Trump has also sought to contain public alarm by registering fewer cases of the coronavirus, a decision that public health experts say risks misleading Americans about where the virus has spread. The president said he would prefer not to let 3,533 people on a cruise ship held off the coast of San Francisco to disembark onto American soil, even if they were placed into quarantine, in part because it would inflate the number of American infections. Nineteen crew members and two passengers of the ship have tested positive for the coronavirus.Two passengers on the ship, Cookie Clark, 76, and her husband, Joe Clark, 81, of Oakdale, Calif., said they had been watching the news constantly and were angry when they heard Mr. Trump say on Friday that he preferred the ship not dock in the United States.“As American citizens, we have a right to be back on U.S. soil,” Mr. Clark said.Ms. Clark, a retired realtor, said she was appalled. “We’re just numbers to him,” she said.Josh Michaud, an associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that it was in the public’s interest to know where cases of the virus were as soon as possible.“That’s going to be the foundation for developing an effective response. You need to know where the disease is to erect the resources,” Mr. Michaud said. “If you don’t, you’re flying blind.”Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting from New York and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco.

Reince Priebus, John F. Kelly and Mick Mulvaney each tried to navigate Mr. Trump’s harum-scarum West Wing in his own way, alternately trying to control, channel or enable the advice-resistant president, only to eventually fall out of favor. Mr. Meadows has an advantage none of them did in that he has been a political confidant and ardent champion for much longer before taking the job and many in Mr. Trump’s circle were encouraged by his ascension. But he has never been tested like this before.“The president hasn’t gone through four chiefs of staff in three and a half years because he’s trying to figure out how to govern,” said Chris Whipple, the author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of those who served in the role. “He’s gone through four chiefs because he’s not interested in governing. He lives to campaign — to divide, demonize and disrupt — not to get things done.” Reince Priebus, John F.

A former real estate developer turned conservative bomb-thrower, Mr. Meadows made his name as a disrupter of the system, clashing repeatedly with House Republican leaders over spending, immigration and other issues, and inciting the rebellion that forced Speaker John A. Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded. He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor, on the floor during a contentious vote. In that sense, then, Mr. Meadows may make sense.

He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor, on the floor during a contentious vote. Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.“It’s a great move by the president,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows’s appointment. “Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he’s a great wartime consigliere and we’re heading into election season. Mark understands the president’s electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.”While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump’s racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings’s memorial service that talked about the value of the “unexpected friendship.”“I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,” Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. “We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he’s someone who makes things about policy and not people.”Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows’s policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. “I don’t see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,” she said. “I don’t think that’s possible. And if he thinks that’s possible, he’s probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.”Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described “fat nerd” and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate. He ran for the House in 2012 as an outspoken critic of the Republican establishment.

He ran for the House in 2012 as an outspoken critic of the Republican establishment. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. “2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,” he said that year. He later called it “probably a poor choice of words on my part,” and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in “American Carnage.”Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the “Access Hollywood” tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta’s book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman — so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. “Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,” former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. “They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.”Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.

The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work. But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president. At one point early last year, during testimony by Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump’s.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to “actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.” Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows “one of my best friends,” and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president’s defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump’s camp. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney’s corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.“Mark is always up for the challenge,” Mr. Gaetz said. “We all knew when Mark wasn’t running for re-election that he didn’t lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it’s no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.” But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president.

"A Florida woman was charged on Thursday after officials said she filled out 10 voter registration forms with false information, at least six of which enrolled Democratic and independent voters in the Republican Party without their consent.The woman, Cheryl A. Hall, 63, of Clermont, Fla., worked for Florida First, a voter registration group heavily funded by America First Policies, which supports President Trump.America First Policies announced plans last year to spend more than $20 million on voter registration efforts in at least four battleground states: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.Alan Hays, the supervisor of elections in Lake County, Fla., near Orlando, said that although Ms. Hall was charged with submitting 10 false voter registration forms, he believes she might have submitted another 109 forms with false information.

Florida holds its presidential primary on March 17, and Lake County began early voting on Thursday.“It has absolutely nothing to do with party politics,” said Mr. Hays, a Republican. “If you’re misbehaving, I’m going to call you on it.”ImageCheryl A.

The registration forms that switched their party affiliation were stamped with a number belonging to Florida First, and when he contacted the group, it traced the forms back to Ms. Hall, he said.Although the forms contained the correct names of voters, their dates of birth, Social Security numbers and other details were incorrect and automatically flagged by the county election database as unverifiable, he said.“It’s just really bizarre,” Mr. Hays said. “I don’t know what part of her imagination was convinced she could get away with this.”Ms. Hall was charged with 10 counts of submitting false voter registration information and released on $20,000 bond on Thursday, according to the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.At least six of the forms were of Democrats or independents who had their party affiliation changed to Republican, Mr. Hays said. The others had their signatures or other details falsified, he said.“We don’t know what she was hoping to accomplish,” said Lt. John Herrell of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, adding that it “certainly does not appear” that Florida First did anything wrong. Ms. Hall, he said, may have simply gone “off the rails.”No one answered at a phone number listed for Ms. Hall, and it was not immediately clear if she had a lawyer.

Florida First has advertised that it pays $15 to $18 an hour to voter registration canvassers “who believe in the conservative principles of limited government, keeping taxes low and that an overly intrusive Federal government has a negative impact on our citizens.”Mr. Hays said he had seen Ms. Hall, a registered Republican, canvassing with voter registration forms at several community events.At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Hays said he wanted voters to know that even if unauthorized changes were made to their registration files, they could still cast a provisional ballot and election officials would ensure that every eligible vote was counted.

She was able to leverage her language skills to pivot to another career instead.“You can tell all the stories you want,” Ms. Uleski said. “But if you don’t have the credentials, you don’t get work.”In his State of the Union address to Congress last month, President Trump made a significant economic boast that did not garner much attention: the historic decline in veteran unemployment, which now rests around 3 percent.

Like other Americans, veterans have benefited from a roaring economy and a robust labor market. But as a group, they are often hampered by the difficulty of converting skills gained in wars to private-sector jobs, a lack of strong professional networks and a culture of treating veterans as charity cases.Underemployment is one of the greatest issues faced by returning veterans — and by their spouses, who often lose ground through constant relocations. Veterans are 37 percent more likely to be underemployed than nonveterans, a recent study by LinkedIn found.“Underemployment with this group is very concerning,” said Sarah Roberts, the company’s head of Military and Veteran Programs.Unlike students, many of whom choose their majors, a majority of people enlisted in the military are assigned their tasks and points of focus. When they leave, many veterans are eager to shift gears but lack clear pathways to do so.“About 55 percent of vets in transition want to do something totally different than what they did in the military,” Ms. Roberts said. Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has put together several programs to help place veterans in jobs, concede this is among the chief obstacles.

Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has put together several programs to help place veterans in jobs, concede this is among the chief obstacles. Veterans, particularly those without college degrees, are often pushed toward low-skill jobs even though their training and the culture of the military might well translate into other types of positions. A clear pipeline to those jobs, however, does not exist for veterans.“The employers are saying ‘It’s not our job to train them,’” said Joan Lynch, the chief content and programming officer at WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign that focuses on labor in the United States. “So whose job is it to train veterans for the work force? The military? No; they teach them to defend our nation. Employers aren’t doing it, either.”Many jobs require licenses and training for skills that veterans learned in combat, particularly in health care. Many veterans who acquired deep knowledge and specialized emergency response techniques, for example, would have no immediate access to the long credentialing process to become a physician assistant.Ms. Lynch said she had encountered many returning medics who were unable to immediately translate their skills into jobs — even when they had privately tutored medical residents on skills like suturing — because they lacked a license. At the same time, those extensive experiences may not apply in other, often lower-wage jobs for which they are vastly overqualified.“These people have about $1 million of training that the government has put into them,” Ms. Lynch said. “But they don’t have one credit toward a professional degree, and they end up being turned down for jobs delivering dry cleaning. It breaks your heart.”Under the most recent Defense Department budget bill, Congress authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess a possible partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems in which veterans can earn credit toward a master’s degree in physician assistant studies for their military operational work and medic training.Dr. David W. Callaway, an emergency physician at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., started a program in 2015 to teach veterans to translate their military medical training for civilian hospital settings.

His team spearheaded a partnership among Atrium Health, Wake Forest School of Medicine and the Defense Department to create a program that allows Special Operations combat medics to earn master’s degree credit toward a physician assistant license while serving in operational units.The program relied on private donor funding, even a local high school fund-raiser. Congress has authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess scaling the partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems.State governments, however, are best equipped to take on this issue, experts say.“We need to reform the occupational licensing laws,” said Rebecca Burgess, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “This could help veterans and military spouses whose unemployment rates have skyrocketed.”Indeed, the unemployment rate for military spouses is 24 percent, in large part because of frequent relocations and an inability to transfer occupational licenses from state to state. Last year, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona signed a bill to recognize out-of-state licenses in many areas to permit workers to become licensed in Arizona without additional training or education.Veterans leave the military with educational benefits coveted by most American high school students. In addition to the G.I. Bill, which provides 36 months of tuition payments and housing allowances, veterans have many other programs to draw on, such as an additional nine months of subsidized education for those pursuing STEM-related degrees and extensive new transition training programs.“Because of all these programs, veterans are better equipped to reach the American dream than their nonveteran counterparts,” said Margarita Devlin, the principal deputy under secretary for benefits at the Department of Veterans Affairs.But there are often complications, especially for those who have served for many years and now have families to support.

"It was the question that followed former Mayor Pete Buttigieg everywhere he went when he first announced his presidential campaign: Is the country really ready to send a gay man to the White House?But soon, it seemed, the novelty wore off. Many saw that as a sign of progress: Part of the reason his campaign was such a big deal, they said, was that it wasn’t a big deal what his sexual orientation was.Instead, other questions arose around Mr. Buttigieg’s prospects of winning. What does the mayor of the small Midwestern city of South Bend, Ind., know about being president? Why isn’t he connecting in a more significant way with African-American voters? Would he be able to unify the fractured Democratic Party? Some gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender activists, many of them young and nonwhite and far to the left of Mr. Buttigieg, started to ask whether he really represented their interests.In certain progressive circles, in online commentary and in much of the national media, the history-making aspect of Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign often warranted only a passing and perfunctory mention. And the sprawling, diverse Democratic field featured plenty of other potential firsts, including six women, one of them African-American, a Latino man and two Jewish men.

But many, especially those who have fought for L.G.B.T. equality for decades and have seen society grow more tolerant but not entirely accepting, say that Mr. Buttigieg’s contribution to history will be misunderstood and diminished if the main takeaway is that the first openly gay man to have a serious shot at the presidency elicited a collective shrug from a country, as if the country had moved on from its homophobic past.Roberta Kaplan, who argued the 2013 Supreme Court case that overturned a federal law limiting recognition of marriage to heterosexual couples, Windsor v. United States, said in a tweet last week shortly after Mr. Buttigieg ended his campaign that she was still in awe that he got as far as he did.If you had asked her seven years ago whether an openly gay candidate could credibly run for president in 2020, she wrote on Twitter, “I would have said you were nuts.” In an interview a few days later, Ms. Kaplan said she was still just as struck by Mr. Buttigieg’s success. But just as surprising, she said, is “that there’s a failure to understand history — and a very recent history.”“On the one hand, people over-assume acceptance and equality. And on the other hand, there is no question the L.G.B.T.Q. movement has achieved equality at a speed that probably no other modern movement has,” Ms. Kaplan added. “And those things kind of have to live in tension.” But many, especially those who have fought for L.G.B.T. equality for decades and have seen society grow more tolerant but not entirely accepting, say that Mr. Buttigieg’s contribution to history will be misunderstood and diminished if the main takeaway is that the first openly gay man to have a serious shot at the presidency elicited a collective shrug from a country, as if the country had moved on from its homophobic past.Roberta Kaplan, who argued the 2013 Supreme Court case that overturned a federal law limiting recognition of marriage to heterosexual couples, Windsor v.

One was the reality of certain progressive activists, rival Democrats, social media and many of the reporters who covered him, which was focused on why he shouldn’t or couldn’t win the nomination, his supporters said. Mr. Buttigieg felt that tension constantly during his campaign, existing in between what were essentially two realities. One was the reality of certain progressive activists, rival Democrats, social media and many of the reporters who covered him, which was focused on why he shouldn’t or couldn’t win the nomination, his supporters said. “The too-isms always followed him,” said Tom Sheridan, a consultant in Washington who has worked with Congress to expand legal protections for people with AIDS and disabilities. “He was too young, too straight-acting, too boring, too inexperienced because he was mayor of a city that was too small.”To many who felt a sense of empowerment from his campaign, though, those misgivings felt disconnected from their reality.Mr. Buttigieg described the gratitude and optimism he often encountered when he was traveling the country, and acknowledged it was so powerful it took him aback at first. “Even I thought, ‘OK, maybe this is not all that much of an event,’” he said in an interview last year.Strangers would approach him and try to convey how much it meant to see someone so public and so prominent talk about his experience as an L.G.B.T. person. One was just 9, a boy in Denver who told Mr. Buttigieg at a rally a few days before he dropped out of the race, “I want to be brave like you,” and asked, “Would you help me tell the world I’m gay, too?”Sometimes they were much older, like the flight attendant who was so overcome with emotion when he encountered Mr. Buttigieg at an airport that he was unable to speak. “He just made eye contact and came to the point of tears,” Mr. Buttigieg recalled. “And then walked off not knowing what else to do.”Even in 2020, part of the paradox of running a successful campaign as an openly gay man meant that his orientation could not define him to voters who might not fully accept it. He understood this, and ran his campaign in a way that always sought equilibrium. The protective armor against his sexual orientation seemed in many ways to be his résumé. He was “Mayor Pete” the Rhodes Scholar, Navy veteran, pianist and technocrat conversant in eight languages. “The too-isms always followed him,” said Tom Sheridan, a consultant in Washington who has worked with Congress to expand legal protections for people with AIDS and disabilities. “He was too young, too straight-acting, too boring, too inexperienced because he was mayor of a city that was too small.”To many who felt a sense of empowerment from his campaign, though, those misgivings felt disconnected from their reality.Mr. Buttigieg described the gratitude and optimism he often encountered when he was traveling the country, and acknowledged it was so powerful it took him aback at first. “Even I thought, ‘OK, maybe this is not all that much of an event,’” he said in an interview last year.Strangers would approach him and try to convey how much it meant to see someone so public and so prominent talk about his experience as an L.G.B.T. person.

In this sense, he too is responsible for the way his sexual orientation was downplayed.But the backlash he faced from fellow Democrats and liberal activists limited his ability to control his campaign’s narrative — a reality of presidential politics that is hardly unique to him. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s early days as a candidate, for instance, were dominated not by questions over her proposed wealth tax or other policy initiatives she wanted to discuss but over her claims of Native American heritage.Mr. Buttigieg had to answer tough criticism from African-American residents of South Bend who said they felt marginalized and neglected. And as he acknowledged, his explanations weren’t always sufficient.These criticisms made him seem like a poor fit for a generation of younger liberals who are deeply concerned about issues of racial justice and inequality. Progressives said they felt he didn’t speak for them; they sometimes heckled him at his events.

Many of his defenders said the media and other Democrats focused too aggressively on his inability to attract more support from black voters, a problem other candidates like Ms. Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar faced.“Why was Pete singled out for a problem that other candidates were having?” said Joel Benenson, the Democratic strategist and pollster who worked for the Obama and Hillary Clinton campaigns and whose firm consulted for Mr. Buttigieg. Mr. Benenson pointed out that even after Mr. Buttigieg came in first in the delegate count in the Iowa caucuses and a close second place to Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire, large percentages of the country still did not know much about him, making judgments about his inability to attract entire demographics premature.After Iowa, he was viewed more favorably than unfavorably in a poll of registered voters nationwide by Quinnipiac University. (This was not true for Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, the poll found.) But almost a third of those surveyed said they had not heard enough about him to form an opinion.

And he’s not even nationally known,” Mr. Benenson added, which is an achievement he said was also glossed over.His supporters also argued that skeptics placed an unfair focus on how Mr. Buttigieg would perform in South Carolina, turning a small, conservative and highly religious state into a definitive proxy for his support among African-American voters nationwide. They also pointed to some statewide polling that indicated voters there would find it difficult to vote for an L.G.B.T. presidential candidate. “We have a long ways to go in the South and with the church,” said Rev. T. Anthony Spearman, president of the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. and a proponent of L.G.B.T. rights. Asked if he thought an openly gay or lesbian person could be elected president, Mr. Spearman said yes. “With Mayor Pete, I think down the road we’ll see how much of an impact his running will affect us.” Asked if Mr. Buttigieg could have won his state, Mr. Spearman said he wasn’t so sure.Though first-of-their-kind campaigns often fall short, they can make progress in other ways. Robert Raben, a Democratic consultant who works on liberal causes and diversity initiatives, likened Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign to the moment in 1984 when Jesse Jackson stood onstage with his family at the Democratic National Convention. He had run for and lost the Democratic nomination that year, and yet his speech was watched by some 33 million viewers.“You saw a black nuclear family that could have been in the White House,” Mr. Raben said. “It went from the abstract to the concrete.” With the idea of a gay couple living in the White House, Mr. Raben added, “Buttigieg brought us from the abstract to the concrete.”While the question of whether the country is ready to send a gay man to the White House remains unanswered, the question of whether Americans will treat one seriously as a presidential candidate is now closed, he said. “And we’ll never have to have that conversation again.” “This guy, a mayor of a city of 100,000 people, was coming in first and second.

"WASHINGTON — After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump administration about the coronavirus, the government’s top health officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt about the dangers of the outbreak.If he approved, they would level with the public.But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan. At noon on Feb. 25, just as Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home, she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States was about to change.“The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said. Schools might have to close, conferences could be canceled, businesses might make employees work from home. She had told her own children, she said, to prepare for “significant disruption to our lives.” WASHINGTON — After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump administration about the coronavirus, the government’s top health officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt about the dangers of the outbreak.If he approved, they would level with the public.But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan.

The stock market plummeted, cable news blared apocalyptic headlines and by the time Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews early the next morning, his critics were accusing him of sowing confusion on an issue of life or death. The president immediately got on the phone with Alex M. Azar II, his secretary of health and human services. That call scared people, he shouted, referring to Ms. Messonnier’s warnings. Are we at the point that we will have to start closing schools? the president added, alarmed, according to an official who heard about the call.To health officials, the message needed to change with the outbreak. “The epicenter was shifting” as the number of new cases outside China surpassed those inside, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C. “The issue of what this might mean to us became more important.”From the beginning, the Trump administration’s attempts to forestall an outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth. Even as the government’s scientists and leading health experts raised the alarm early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance and doubt at the White House — especially from the president — about spooking financial markets and inciting panic.“It’s going to all work out,” Mr. Trump said as recently as Thursday night. “Everybody has to be calm.

Clear, honest communication is also crucial, and the United States has at times criticized China and other governments for being less than transparent.

Redfield, the C.D.C.’s director, called to tell him China had potentially discovered a new coronavirus. Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive who helped manage the response to earlier SARS and anthrax outbreaks, told his chief of staff to make sure that the National Security Council was aware.This is a very big deal, Mr. Azar told him.The Trump administration had eliminated the global health unit that had been part of the National Security Council, but within days, a team was meeting daily in the basement of the West Wing, pleading with Chinese officials to allow doctors from the C.D.C. into their country.For weeks, the Chinese refused offers of public health cooperation. “China nice-talked it for a month,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security who was working on the coronavirus effort. “‘Oh, well, thank you for the offer. Blah, blah.’”On Saturday, Jan. 18, a day after the C.D.C. dispatched 100 people to three American airports to screen travelers coming from Wuhan, China, Mr. Azar made his first call to Mr. Trump about the virus, dialing him directly at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. The president insisted on talking about e-cigarettes first, but Mr. Azar steered him to the virus. Mr. Azar was at his home in suburban Washington, on Friday, Jan. 3, when Dr. Robert R.

Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.“We have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.“We have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” On the evening of Jan. 28, a new kind of crisis broke out in the skies.The State Department had ordered the evacuation of the American Consulate in Wuhan and a 747 was in the air. But as it headed for the United States with hundreds of passengers who possibly carried the virus, administration officials in Washington were in a frantic scramble about where it should land.Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, tried to secure some kind of military base in California, but was struggling to cut through Pentagon red tape. In a panic, his staff started booking hundreds of rooms at three hotels in the Los Angeles area, asking for full floors so they could separate potentially infected evacuees from other guests.One idea was to land the plane at the Ontario airport outside Los Angeles, and officials went so far as to schedule, then cancel, a briefing for some members of the California congressional delegation. After hours of wrangling, and with the plane still in the air, Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, said the plane could land at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, which had space to house all of the passengers.Inside the White House, a debate broke out, centered on concerns that had become ever-present since the virus first emerged: How would the government’s actions be perceived by the public? And what would the president think?At issue was whether to impose a federal quarantine order on the evacuees to prevent them from leaving for 14 days. Such authority had not been used since a smallpox outbreak in 1969. But officials had to find some way to make sure the passengers did not leave the base until it was clear they were not infected.

One woman balked, so California officials, who use quarantine authority more often, stepped in and forced the passengers to stay.Time to Provoke China? By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day. Any one of them could be the trigger for a new and undetected American outbreak.Over four days in the White House Situation Room, the nation’s top public health and national security officials engaged in a fierce debate over whether to take the extraordinary step of banning travel from China.Public health officials were initially wary. Experts have long recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it is often ineffective and can stymie the response by limiting the movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain the disease. A ban would anger China, they worried, ending any hope of cooperation with American medical teams.Officials at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security argued that China had already proved unwilling to cooperate. A third group inside the White House was worried that the move would incite panic and could roil the financial markets.By Thursday, Jan. 30, the public health officials had come around. Mr. Azar, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic’s center could buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. “There was so much we didn’t know about this virus,” Dr. Redfield said in an interview. “We were rapidly understanding it was much more transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.” By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day.

Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?The president sided with his more aggressive aides, and announced the ban next day.Still, Mr. Trump was publicly upbeat about the effects of the virus. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, “By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government’s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation’s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the administration that it was quickly being resolved.Americans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States.

At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, “By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government’s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation’s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the administration that it was quickly being resolved.Americans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States. The month ended with a whistle-blower’s claim that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in California without the personal protective gear that is required for anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients. None of the workers tested positive for the virus, but the allegation shook Congress.‘I Like the Numbers Being Where They Are.’ The month ended with a whistle-blower’s claim that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in California without the personal protective gear that is required for anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients.

As Mr. Biden now attempts to leverage his Super Tuesday success and build momentum, Mr. Sanders may face even longer odds in Michigan than he did in 2016. The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state.

Recognizing the stakes here, Mr. Sanders is assailing Mr. Biden for his support of what he called “disastrous trade agreements like Nafta.” And his campaign is airing a commercial in the manufacturing-heavy state that features a former autoworker highlighting the former vice president’s lack of regret for supporting the pact while pointing out that Mr. Sanders has opposed free trade deals.As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.

Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said former Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.” Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary.

Ms. Whitmer, Ms. Slotkin and Ms. Stevens all threw their support behind Mr. Biden this past week.

In an acknowledgment that his campaign would be grievously wounded if he did not rebound in Michigan, Mr. Sanders canceled an event scheduled for Mississippi, which also votes Tuesday, to spend more time here. And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals.It is clear why Mr. Sanders is scrambling — the Super Tuesday results carried ominous signs for his candidacy. In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.

Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest. In suburban Oakland County, for example, Mrs. Clinton won by about five points in 2016. But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state. He said, “everybody in my circle is coalescing around Joe Biden.”At first, he said, black and white voters alike were “looking for President Obama — but instead we went with the one we’ve always felt comfortable with.”Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Dearborn, Mich.

His mother lost their house that she had fought to keep after his father’s suicide, and she and her two sons had to move in with Mr. Michelz’s grandparents.That year, when Mr. Michelz was 18, he took a part-time job cleaning out houses after they had been foreclosed on. He saw closets stuffed with cherished possessions — photographs, prom dresses, watches — and threw these things into dumpsters. Once, a man begged him to open the door so he could retrieve his belongings.It was a searing experience and the beginning of his political education.“When I hear Bernie’s forgiving debt and people say, ‘It’s way too expensive,’ I think, you did the craziest thing for the banks,” he said of the bailouts. “Yet normal families were thrown in the street, literally.”He continued: “The middle finger was given to our family, while the rich guys got off scot-free.” “It was like everything was for sale,” he said. “I always thought reality TV shows were really embarrassing.

He started paying more attention to the news. He was spending a lot of time online and started looking up things he had heard, like the line from the protesters at Occupy Wall Street that the top 1 percent of Americans had more wealth than close to half of the rest of the country.“At first I thought it couldn’t be true,” he said. “It just didn’t make sense.”It was around this time he first saw Mr. Sanders — on his grandparents’ TV talking about health care. Mr. Michelz looked him up and saw that he had been saying the same thing for years. He liked what he heard. He thought about his $24,000 in medical debt and how arbitrary it seemed.

As for the economy, nothing made sense. He spent years in college classes learning teaching, but ended up working in a tire store because it paid better. He went to college, just like everybody said he should, but is now working in a job that does not require a degree.Mr. Sanders seemed to be telling him why his life looked and felt the way it did. His financial instability was not some individual failure, but a function of a broader economic system that had become so unequal that fixing it was a moral calling.What Mr. Sanders proposed “was creating the conditions to make people’s lives less stressful,” he said.And as for the arguments against Mr. Sanders — all these things he wanted would cost too much and would cause economic chaos and people to suffer — that was already happening, he thought. Domestic violence, families breaking apart, children not getting the care they needed — the common thread was the economic system.The fact that Mr. Sanders was rejected by the establishment merely proved his worth for Mr. Michelz.“I knew it was OK to be hated by the mainstream,” he said.So on March 8, 2016, he rode to the polling station in Yale with his grandfather. Rush Limbaugh was on the radio. When they walked inside, he voted for Mr. Sanders and his grandfather voted for Mr. Trump. It was his first time voting, but he does not remember feeling much of anything.“I just thought, I’m going to at least put my voice in a direction, even if no one hears it,” he said.

Mr. Michelz never considered voting for Mr. Trump, finding him unappealing and bothered by his stance on climate change. But he does not hate him. Some of the people he loves most voted for him. He understands why.“The truth is, they are speaking to a frustrated America,” Mr. Michelz said of political candidates. “That’s why someone who is as ridiculous as Trump got elected. People wanted to see someone who wasn’t proper, who wasn’t afraid of the establishment. He appealed to people who thought it was all becoming a sham.”He added: “It’s the same thing with Bernie.”A few months later, Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee.In November, he did not vote. Looking back, he does not regret it.This NovemberFour years later, he has even more at stake.Mr. Michelz is now married. After years of blocking out his ruined credit score, he cares a lot about it. He still cannot get a loan, which means leasing a new car is out of the question. He wants badly to buy one with heated seats for Sarah. Instead they are stuck with their old models. He recently poured $3,000 in bonuses from his job at the tire shop into his car.Sometimes Mr. Michelz worries about not providing enough for his family.“I think about Sarah,” he said. “She’s around doctors every day. Does she ever have a thought, ‘I could be with someone who makes way more money?’ I know that’s irrational. On the one hand I’m bothered by it. But on the other, I know I’m giving 110 percent.”So, he tries to show her every day that he loves her. He often buys her flowers. Last Thursday, a small vase in the kitchen held two carnations and a rose. Mr. Michelz never considered voting for Mr. Trump, finding him unappealing and bothered by his stance on climate change.

This year he found that he loved Andrew Yang.“To me, he made Bernie seem outdated,” he said. When Mr. Yang dropped out, “I was bummed, but I was happy, too. His message got out there.”He feels wiser now. He no longer believes the American story that everyone should be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.“That’s a big lie that benefits the rich and keeps the system the same,” he said.He will still vote for Mr. Sanders, though he knows it is a long shot.“Even if it doesn’t work, I’m going to throw my vote that way,” Mr. Michelz said. “I have nothing to lose.” All of this has brought him back to politics, which he now knows is the thread that runs through many of these problems.

"WASHINGTON — Erik Prince, the security contractor with close ties to the Trump administration, has in recent years helped recruit former American and British spies for secretive intelligence-gathering operations that included infiltrating Democratic congressional campaigns, labor organizations and other groups considered hostile to the Trump agenda, according to interviews and documents.One of the former spies, an ex-MI6 officer named Richard Seddon, helped run a 2017 operation to copy files and record conversations in a Michigan office of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers’ unions in the nation. Mr. Seddon directed an undercover operative to secretly tape the union’s local leaders and try to gather information that could be made public to damage the organization, documents show.Using a different alias the next year, the same undercover operative infiltrated the congressional campaign of Abigail Spanberger, then a former C.I.A. officer who went on to win an important House seat in Virginia as a Democrat. The campaign discovered the operative and fired her.Both operations were run by Project Veritas, a conservative group that has gained attention using hidden cameras and microphones for sting operations on news organizations, Democratic politicians and liberal advocacy groups. Mr. Seddon’s role in the teachers’ union operation — detailed in internal Project Veritas emails that have emerged from the discovery process of a court battle between the group and the union — has not previously been reported, nor has Mr. Prince’s role in recruiting Mr. Seddon for the group’s activities.

Both Project Veritas and Mr. Prince have ties to President Trump’s aides and family. Whether any Trump administration officials or advisers to the president were involved in the operations, even tacitly, is unclear. But the effort is a glimpse of a vigorous private campaign to try to undermine political groups or individuals perceived to be in opposition to Mr. Trump’s agenda.Mr. Prince, the former head of Blackwater Worldwide and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has at times served as an informal adviser to Trump administration officials. He worked with the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn during the presidential transition. In 2017, he met with White House and Pentagon officials to pitch a plan to privatize the Afghan war using contractors in lieu of American troops. Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, rejected the idea.Mr. Prince appears to have become interested in using former spies to train Project Veritas operatives in espionage tactics sometime during the 2016 presidential campaign. Reaching out to several intelligence veterans — and occasionally using Mr. Seddon to make the pitch — Mr. Prince said he wanted the Project Veritas employees to learn skills like how to recruit sources and how to conduct clandestine recordings, among other surveillance techniques.James O’Keefe, the head of Project Veritas, declined to answer detailed questions about Mr. Prince, Mr. Seddon and other topics, but he called his group a “proud independent news organization” that is involved in dozens of investigations. He said that numerous sources were coming to the group “providing confidential documents, insights into internal processes and wearing hidden cameras to expose corruption and misconduct.” Both Project Veritas and Mr. Prince have ties to President Trump’s aides and family.

A spokesman for Mr. Prince declined to comment. Emails sent to Mr. Seddon went unanswered.Mr. Prince is under investigation by the Justice Department over whether he lied to a congressional committee examining Russian interference in the 2016 election, and for possible violations of American export laws. Last year, the House Intelligence Committee made a criminal referral to the Justice Department about Mr. Prince, saying he lied about the circumstances of his meeting with a Russian banker in the Seychelles in January 2017.Once a small operation running on a shoestring budget, Project Veritas in recent years has had a surge in donations from both private donors and conservative foundations. According to its latest publicly available tax filing, Project Veritas received $8.6 million in contributions and grants in 2018. Mr. O’Keefe earned about $387,000.Last year, the group received a $1 million contribution made through the law firm Alston & Bird, a financial document obtained by The New York Times showed. A spokesman for the firm said that Alston & Bird “has never contributed to Project Veritas on its own behalf, nor is it a client of ours.” The spokesman declined to say on whose behalf the contribution was made.The financial document also listed the names of others who gave much smaller amounts to Project Veritas last year. Several of them confirmed their donations.The group has also become intertwined with the political activities of Mr. Trump and his family. The Trump Foundation gave $20,000 to Project Veritas in 2015, the year that Mr. Trump began his bid for the presidency. The next year, during a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump claimed without substantiation that videos released by Mr. O’Keefe showed that Mrs. Clinton and President Barack Obama had paid people to incite violence at rallies for Mr. Trump.In a book published in 2018, Mr. O’Keefe wrote that Mr. Trump years earlier had encouraged him to infiltrate Columbia University and obtain Mr. Obama’s records.Last month, Project Veritas made public secretly recorded video of a longtime ABC News correspondent who was critical of the network’s political coverage and its emphasis on business considerations over journalism.

Mr. O’Keefe and others shared social media photos of taking target practice with guns at the ranch, including one post from Mr. O’Keefe saying that with the training, Project Veritas will be “the next great intelligence agency.” Mr. Prince had hired a former MI6 officer to help train the Project Veritas operatives, The Intercept wrote, but it did not identify the officer.Mr. Seddon regularly updated Mr. O’Keefe about the operation against the Michigan teachers’ union, according to internal Project Veritas emails, where the language of the group’s leaders is marbled with spy jargon.They used a code name — LibertyU — for their operative inside the organization, Marisa Jorge, who graduated from Liberty University in Virginia, one of the nation’s largest Christian colleges. Mr. Seddon wrote that Ms. Jorge “copied a great many documents from the file room,” and Mr. O’Keefe bragged that the group would be able to get “a ton more access agents inside the educational establishment.”The emails refer to other operations, including weekly case updates, along with training activities that involved “operational targeting.” Project Veritas redacted specifics about those operations from the messages.In August 2017, Ms. Jorge wrote to Mr. Seddon that she had managed to record a local union leader talking about Ms. DeVos and other topics.“Good stuff,” Mr. Seddon wrote back. “Did you receive the spare camera yet?”As education secretary, Ms. DeVos has been a vocal critic of teachers’ unions, saying in 2018 that they have a “stranglehold” over politicians at the federal and state levels. She and Mr. Prince grew up in Michigan, where their father made a fortune in the auto parts business.AFT Michigan sued Project Veritas in federal court, alleging trespassing, eavesdropping and other offenses. The teachers’ union is asking for more than $3 million in damages, accusing the group of being a “vigilante organization which claims to be dedicated to exposing corruption.

Mr. Halderman was copied on several messages providing updates about the Michigan operation, and in one message, he gave instructions to Ms. Jorge. Project Veritas tax filings list Mr. Halderman as a “project manager.”Two other employees, Gaz Thomas and Samuel Chamberlain, were also identified in emails and appeared to play important roles in the Michigan operation. Efforts to locate Mr. Thomas were unsuccessful. A man named Samuel Chamberlain who matched the description of the one employed by Mr. O’Keefe denied he worked for Project Veritas. He did not respond to follow-up phone messages or an email.Last year, Project Veritas submitted a proposed list of witnesses for the trial over the lawsuit. Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Thomas were on the list. Mr. Seddon was not.Ms. Jorge, 23, did not respond to email addresses associated with her Liberty University account. In an archived version of her LinkedIn page, Ms. Jorge wrote she had a deep interest in the conservative movement and hoped one day to serve on the Supreme Court after attending law school.In a YouTube video, Mr. O’Keefe described the lawsuit as “frivolous” and pointed to a portion of the deposition in which David Hecker, the president of AFT Michigan, said that one of the goals of the lawsuit was to “stop Project Veritas from doing the kind of work that it does.”Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement: “Let’s be clear who the wrongdoer is here: Project Veritas used a fake intern to lie her way into our Michigan office, to steal documents and to spy — and they got caught.

At the time, Ms. Spanberger was running to unseat a sitting Republican congressman in a race both parties considered important for control of the House. Ms. Jorge was eventually exposed and kicked out of the campaign office.It was unclear whether Mr. Seddon was involved in planning that operation.Mr. Seddon was a longtime British intelligence officer who served around the world, including in Washington in the years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He is married to an American diplomat, Alice Seddon, who is serving in the American consulate in Lagos, Nigeria.Mr. O’Keefe and his group have taken aim at targets over the years including Planned Parenthood, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Democracy Partners, a group that consults with liberal and progressive electoral causes. In 2016, a Project Veritas operative infiltrated Democracy Partners using a fake name and fabricated résumé and made secret recordings of the staff. The year after the sting, Democracy Partners sued Project Veritas, and its lawyers have since deposed Mr. O’Keefe.In that deposition, Mr. O’Keefe defended the group’s undercover tactics, saying they were part of a long tradition of investigative journalism going back to muckraking reporters like Upton Sinclair. “I’m not ashamed of the methods that we use or the recordings that we use,” he said.He was asked whether he had provided any of the group’s secret recordings of Democracy Partners to the Republican National Committee or any member of the Trump family.

He said that he did not think so.In 2010, Mr. O’ Keefe and three others pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor after admitting they entered a government building in New Orleans under false pretenses as part of a sting.Kitty Bennett contributed research.",Erik Prince Recruits Ex-Spies to Help Infiltrate Liberal Groups,2020-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/erik-prince-project-veritas.html,new_york_times

Reince Priebus, John F. Kelly and Mick Mulvaney each tried to navigate Mr. Trump’s harum-scarum West Wing in his own way, alternately trying to control, channel or enable the advice-resistant president, only to eventually fall out of favor. Mr. Meadows has an advantage none of them did in that he has been a political confidant and ardent champion for much longer before taking the job and many in Mr. Trump’s circle were encouraged by his ascension. But he has never been tested like this before.“The president hasn’t gone through four chiefs of staff in three and a half years because he’s trying to figure out how to govern,” said Chris Whipple, the author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of those who served in the role. “He’s gone through four chiefs because he’s not interested in governing. He lives to campaign — to divide, demonize and disrupt — not to get things done.” Reince Priebus, John F.

A former real estate developer turned conservative bomb-thrower, Mr. Meadows made his name as a disrupter of the system, clashing repeatedly with House Republican leaders over spending, immigration and other issues, and inciting the rebellion that forced Speaker John A. Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded. He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor, on the floor during a contentious vote. In that sense, then, Mr. Meadows may make sense.

Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.“It’s a great move by the president,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows’s appointment. “Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he’s a great wartime consigliere and we’re heading into election season. Mark understands the president’s electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.”While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump’s racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings’s memorial service that talked about the value of the “unexpected friendship.”“I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,” Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. “We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he’s someone who makes things about policy and not people.”Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows’s policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. “I don’t see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,” she said. “I don’t think that’s possible. And if he thinks that’s possible, he’s probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.”Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described “fat nerd” and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate.

Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. “2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,” he said that year. He later called it “probably a poor choice of words on my part,” and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in “American Carnage.”Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the “Access Hollywood” tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta’s book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman — so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. “Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,” former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. “They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.”Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.

But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president. At one point early last year, during testimony by Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump’s.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to “actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.” Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows “one of my best friends,” and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president’s defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump’s camp. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney’s corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.“Mark is always up for the challenge,” Mr. Gaetz said. “We all knew when Mark wasn’t running for re-election that he didn’t lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it’s no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.” But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump will skip the annual bipartisan St. Patrick’s Day luncheon hosted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill this week, White House officials said Sunday, the latest in a series of tit-for-tat snubs between the two most powerful leaders in the nation’s capital.In rejecting Ms. Pelosi’s invitation, Mr. Trump becomes the first president to miss the event since George W. Bush when he was on the verge of war with Iraq in 2003. But Mr. Trump’s aides made no effort to disguise the reason behind the decision, openly attributing it to the president’s unhappiness with the speaker, who led the drive that resulted in his impeachment in the House in December.“Since the speaker has chosen to tear this nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the president will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.Instead, Mr. Trump will host Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland at the White House on Thursday for his own celebration of the holiday and friendship.

When he arrived at the Capitol for his State of the Union address last month, near the end of his Senate trial, Mr. Trump refused to shake Ms. Pelosi’s hand, as was customary, and she ripped up her copy of his speech after he delivered it.The day after the Senate acquitted him, also largely along party lines, Mr. Trump attended the National Prayer Breakfast with Ms. Pelosi. As she sat only a few feet away, he made a barely veiled attack on her faith, branding her as hypocritical for saying she prays for him. He told the clerics in the audience that he did not “like people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that’s not so.”The St. Patrick’s Day lunch traces its history to 1983, when President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, and Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill, a Democrat from Massachusetts, both of Irish descent, established the tradition. It became an annual affair in 1987, and only four times since then have presidents missed it.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Defending against criticism of his handling of the coronavirus, President Trump suggested the other day that he could hardly have been expected to be ready for such an unexpected crisis.“Who would have thought?” he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nerve center for the government’s response to the outbreak. “Who would have thought we would even be having the subject?”Actually, quite a few people would have thought, and did — including the officials in his own White House who were in charge of preparing for just such a pandemic only to have their office shut down in a reorganization in 2018. “The threat of pandemic flu is the No. 1 health security concern,” one of the officials said the day before that happened two years ago. “Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.”For a president who lives in the moment, rarely planning too far ahead, the coronavirus has proved to be a leadership challenge he was not prepared for either.

V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!” After initially brushing off warnings by his health secretary as “alarmist,” Mr. Trump in the last two weeks has taken a more assertive public role on the coronavirus, assigning Vice President Mike Pence to lead the government efforts and making multiple appearances to signal that he takes the threat seriously.But he has also taken a business-as-usual approach to the rest of his schedule, refusing to cancel campaign rallies, fund-raisers or social events even as other large gatherings of Americans are scrubbed. Asked by a reporter on Saturday night if he was worried that infections were getting closer to the White House, Mr. Trump said, “No, I’m not concerned at all.”The president then went inside Mar-a-Lago to host a lavish birthday party for the former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump Jr. and turns 51 on Monday, a preview perhaps of the celebration that may be held next month when Melania Trump turns 50. Among those spotted at the revelry were boldface names from Mr. Trump’s circle, including Mr. Pence, Lindsey Graham, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Tucker Carlson and Matt Gaetz.Mr. Trump happily introduced his visitor, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, to Mr. Carlson and other guests in a video shared on social media, boasting that he “gave him a good gift” by not imposing tariffs on Brazil and “that made him much more popular.” Mr. Bolsonaro laughed and agreed.

He has acknowledged that “I didn’t know people died from the flu” — tens of thousands, in fact, each year in the United States — even though, as The Washington Post pointed out, his own grandfather died of influenza during the 1918 epidemic.But he has credited himself with instinctive understanding of the science. “I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said at the C.D.C. on Friday. “People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”Mr. Trump rejected criticism of the slow distribution of test kits, framing it in terms evoking his battle against impeachment. “The tests are all perfect,” he told reporters, “like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right?” — a reference to the rough transcript of his telephone call with Ukraine’s president that led to his own impeachment for abuse of power.The president’s less-than-perfect pronouncements, however, left public health officials straining to reconcile them on the Sunday talk shows. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” about a White House aide’s assertion that the coronavirus had been “contained,” Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, said: “Well, this is a novel virus. It’s a new situation. And the messaging, quite frankly, is hard.” By the president’s own account, the coronavirus has been an education for him. He has acknowledged that “I didn’t know people died from the flu” — tens of thousands, in fact, each year in the United States — even though, as The Washington Post pointed out, his own grandfather died of influenza during the 1918 epidemic.But he has credited himself with instinctive understanding of the science. “I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said at the C.D.C. on Friday. “People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”Mr. Trump rejected criticism of the slow distribution of test kits, framing it in terms evoking his battle against impeachment. “The tests are all perfect,” he told reporters, “like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right?” — a reference to the rough transcript of his telephone call with Ukraine’s president that led to his own impeachment for abuse of power.The president’s less-than-perfect pronouncements, however, left public health officials straining to reconcile them on the Sunday talk shows. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” about a White House aide’s assertion that the coronavirus had been “contained,” Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, said: “Well, this is a novel virus. It’s a new situation. And the messaging, quite frankly, is hard.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to walk back the president’s claim that “anyone who wants a test can get a test,” saying on “Fox News Sunday” that it would actually be up to a doctor.Mr. Trump has become such a polarizing figure that even when he is not necessarily wrong, many do not trust him. On Sean Hannity’s Fox News show last week, he called the World Health Organization’s estimated fatality rate of 3.4 percent “a false number,” saying “my hunch” was that it would be under 1 percent. It sounded as if he were substituting his uneducated “hunch” for the judgment of professionals.But in fact, he was reflecting what he had been told by health experts, including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, who have concluded that once the full scope of unreported infections is known, the number of deaths will most likely represent a smaller share, possibly “considerably less than” 1 percent. The W.H.O. has also said the rate may fall.Still, at his appearance at the C.D.C., Mr. Trump had no explanation for why his White House shut down the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense established at the National Security Council in 2016 by President Barack Obama after the 2014 Ebola outbreak, stammering to suggest the coronavirus had been a surprise.“Well, I just don’t think — I just don’t think that somebody is going to — without seeing something, like we saw something happening in China,” Mr. Trump said. “As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially — not from the White House. I mean, you know, we don’t need a lab in the White House. But they saw something happening.”Elizabeth Cameron set up the global health security directorate at the White House for Mr. Obama before turning it over to Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, who ran it for Mr. Trump until May 2018, when he was pushed out and the directorate folded into other parts of the National Security Council. Had it still been around, it would have been charged with preparing for exactly the situation now facing the country.“I think it would have made a difference,” Ms. Cameron said on Sunday. “Monitoring and preparing for every eventuality and having a person and a directorate accountable for that is really important and could have been important in this case.”Chris Cameron contributed reporting from Washington.

The report said that Mr. Qahtani spent four or five days in the psychiatric unit of a hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, after an “acute psychotic break” and a suicide attempt in May 2000.Dr. Keram also wrote that Mr. Qahtani suffered a head injury in a car accident when he was a child and was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia. One symptom included hallucinations; he spoke to nonexistent people before he left Saudi Arabia and after his arrival at Guantánamo.Central to Judge Collyer’s order was the contention by Mr. Qahtani’s lawyers that Guantánamo was not equipped to handle his psychiatric illnesses, and that he was entitled to repatriation to culturally appropriate mental health care under the prisoner-of-war provisions in the Army regulations.The provisions give the board members access to both Mr. Qahtani and his clinical records.

"WASHINGTON — In a secure facility underneath the Capitol, members of Congress stopped by all last week to review two classified annexes to the Afghan peace accord with the Taliban that set the criteria for a critical element of the agreement: What constitutes enough “peace” for the United States to withdraw its forces?The Taliban have read the annexes.

And lawmakers who have paid the most attention to the peace plan also openly express frustration with the lack of a mechanism for verifying compliance that they believe Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had promised.At the core of the two documents, according to people familiar with their contents, is a timeline for what should happen over the next 18 months, what kinds of attacks are prohibited by both sides and, most important, how the United States will share information about its troop locations with the Taliban. While it may sound odd that the American military is sharing troop locations with its enemy of 18 years, the goal is to give the Taliban information that would allow it to prevent attacks during the withdrawal. Mr. Pompeo described the annexes last week as “military implementation documents.”That is part of it, but they appear to be much more.Because the documents lay out the specific understandings between the United States and the Taliban — including what bases would remain open under Afghan control — the details are critical to judging whether the United States is making good on its promise to leave only if conditions allow, or whether it is just getting out.The State Department has struggled to explain why the criteria for the terms, standards and thresholds for the American withdrawal could be known to the adversary but not to the American people or allies. In response to questions from The New York Times, the State Department issued a statement on Friday saying that the documents remained classified because “the movement of troops and operations against terrorists are sensitive matters.”“We do not want, for example, ISIS to know those details,” the statement added, referring to Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan.But another reason for the secrecy, according to several people familiar with the matter, is that the annexes leave the markers for peace remarkably vague, making it far from certain that the Taliban must convert into a counterterrorism force — as President Trump suggested a week ago — or that they are required to make complete peace with the elected government of President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan.

In fact, as written, they appear to give Mr. Trump, or his successor, enormous latitude to simply declare that the war is over and leave. But many of Mr. Trump’s aides suggest that American counterterrorism forces and a significant C.I.A. presence should remain in the country. How that will be resolved within the U.S. government, with the Taliban and with the Kabul government remains to be seen, and any resolution likely will prove difficult.

How that will be resolved within the U.S. government, with the Taliban and with the Kabul government remains to be seen, and any resolution likely will prove difficult. Many of the Republicans and Democrats who have taken the opportunity to review the documents say they are unimpressed.Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican and one of the sharpest critics of the accord, said before the agreement was signed last week, “Any deal that the United States would contemplate entering into with the Taliban should be made public in its entirety.”After reading the pact, including the classified annexes, Ms. Cheney said that the deal failed to provide mechanisms to verify that the Taliban was keeping the promises that Mr. Pompeo had described at the signing. “My concerns still remain,” she said, declining to describe the contents.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that the thresholds outlined in the annexes were “remarkably fuzzy” and that it was unclear how the United States would measure success.Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a senior State Department official in the Obama administration, posted a blistering message on Twitter last week about the annexes.

And it serves no national security purpose.”Lawmakers have voiced widespread unhappiness about Mr. Pompeo’s outreach on the subject. He called top members on the Senate and House committees dealing with foreign affairs last weekend to give them a cursory heads-up that the documents were coming to Congress, but lawmakers and their aides said they had not heard from him since.Days before the agreement was signed, Mr. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared to not know about — or seemed reluctant to discuss — the secret annexes.“Are you aware of any contemplation of any secret side deals with the Taliban?” Ms. Cheney asked on Feb. 26 during a House Armed Services Committee meeting.“Nothing, nothing comes to mind right now that you’re mentioning,” Mr. Esper replied.“You’re quoting things that I haven’t seen,” General Milley said.The annexes predominantly revolve around a committee to facilitate communication between the two parties to ensure commitments are being adhered to, according to officials who have read them. No details have come to light about the composition of that committee. “Bottom line: the administration is telling a terrorist group the conditions (such as they are) of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, but not telling the American people,” he wrote. “This is wrong.

He called top members on the Senate and House committees dealing with foreign affairs last weekend to give them a cursory heads-up that the documents were coming to Congress, but lawmakers and their aides said they had not heard from him since.Days before the agreement was signed, Mr. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared to not know about — or seemed reluctant to discuss — the secret annexes.“Are you aware of any contemplation of any secret side deals with the Taliban?” Ms. Cheney asked on Feb. 26 during a House Armed Services Committee meeting.“Nothing, nothing comes to mind right now that you’re mentioning,” Mr. Esper replied.“You’re quoting things that I haven’t seen,” General Milley said.The annexes predominantly revolve around a committee to facilitate communication between the two parties to ensure commitments are being adhered to, according to officials who have read them. No details have come to light about the composition of that committee. They describe the parameters for when it would and would not be appropriate to use force, including commitments from the Taliban not to attack American forces during a withdrawal. Over all, the annexes make up no more than a few pages, often with just one to two sentences laying out each component. For example, the Taliban are not to conduct suicide attacks, and the Americans forgo drone strikes — portions of the agreements that thus far have held.

For example, the Taliban are not to conduct suicide attacks, and the Americans forgo drone strikes — portions of the agreements that thus far have held. General Milley hinted in congressional testimony last week what scope and scale of attacks were not permitted under the agreement.“There is no attacks in 34 provincial capitals, there is no attacks in Kabul, there is no high-profile attacks, there is no suicide bombers, there is no vehicle-borne suicide, no attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition,” General Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, after reports that the Taliban had carried out attacks against Afghan security forces. “There is a whole laundry list of these things that aren’t happening.”In its statement, the State Department said the secret annexes were consistent with the public agreement. “The arrangements include specific commitments by all parties to efforts to continue to reduce violence until a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire is agreed in intra-Afghan negotiations, while preserving the right of all parties to self-defense,” it said. The United States has “a robust monitoring and verification mechanism” to track and assess the behavior of the Taliban, it added.But those who have seen the agreement said the specifics were so nebulous that they doubted the United States retained much leverage.“The documents provided none of the assurances that I felt like we heard from Secretary Pompeo and others about a rigorous process that was going to make sure we hold the Taliban accountable for their end of the deal,” said Representative Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, who served in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus.“I saw nothing in there that gives me any confidence” that those assurances are in place “beyond trusting the word of the Taliban,” he said. “This vague, thin package of documents is all we could actually get agreed to by the Taliban.

Moderate-leaning Democrats have rapidly coalesced behind Mr. Biden, whose campaign has been rolling out new endorsements seemingly nonstop in recent days.In a written statement about her endorsement, Ms. Harris noted the absence of a top female candidate in the primary. “Like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one,” she said, adding that “we find ourselves without any woman on a path to be the Democratic nominee for president.”“This is something we must reckon with and it is something I will have more to say about in the future,” Ms. Harris said. “But we must rise to unite the party and country behind a candidate who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who can ultimately defeat Donald Trump.”Ms. Harris announced her endorsement five days after Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden captured 10 of 14 states, and ahead of another round of contests on Tuesday in six states, including Michigan. Ms. Harris will join Mr. Biden at a rally in Detroit on Monday night.Ms. Harris ended her presidential bid in December, two months before the Iowa caucuses. Now, she is following several of her former rivals for the presidential nomination in getting behind Mr. Biden.

Mr. Sanders pointed on Sunday to Ms. Klobuchar’s and Mr. Buttigieg’s decisions to drop out as the reason he lost several key states to Mr. Biden on Super Tuesday. “The establishment put a great deal of pressure on Pete Buttigieg, on Amy Klobuchar, who ran really aggressive campaigns,” he told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If they had not withdrawn from the race before Super Tuesday, which is kind of a surprise to a lot of people, I suspect we would have won in Minnesota, we would have won in Maine, we would have won in Massachusetts.” For Ms. Harris, the decision to endorse Mr. Biden is particularly striking, because one of the biggest moments of her campaign was a forceful debate-stage exchange with him.“It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,” she said in June during the first Democratic debate.“And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,” she added. “And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.”The exchange gave her a lift in the polls and a temporary burst of momentum that she was not able to sustain. At a fund-raiser on Friday, Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, described Ms. Harris’s attack at the debate as a “punch to the gut.”Some of Ms. Harris’s advisers were privately frustrated that she endorsed Mr. Biden after California voted on Super Tuesday and when it was already clear that he had become the front-runner.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump moved on Monday to address the economic effects of the widening coronavirus crisis by announcing that he would work with Congress on tax cuts and other measures after the worst stock market drop in more than a decade.The president, who played down the virus threat earlier in the day, made an unscheduled evening appearance in the White House briefing room after two Republican members of Congress who have spent time with him in recent days, including one who just rode with him on Air Force One, put themselves into quarantine following exposure to the virus.Also putting himself into isolation was Mark Meadows, the president’s newly designated White House chief of staff. Mr. Meadows, who was named to the role only on Friday and is stepping down from his House seat representing North Carolina, came into contact with the same infected attendee as the other two congressmen at a recent conservative political conference. While he tested negative for the coronavirus, his office said, he would remain quarantined until Wednesday out of caution.While none of the three men have displayed symptoms, the threat of the virus coming so close to the president represented a new stage of the outbreak even as organizations across the country restricted travel and canceled gatherings. Mr. Trump made no mention of his own contacts with the affected lawmakers, but his spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, later said the president would not be tested “because he has neither had prolonged close contact” with confirmed patients “nor does he have any symptoms.” WASHINGTON — President Trump moved on Monday to address the economic effects of the widening coronavirus crisis by announcing that he would work with Congress on tax cuts and other measures after the worst stock market drop in more than a decade.The president, who played down the virus threat earlier in the day, made an unscheduled evening appearance in the White House briefing room after two Republican members of Congress who have spent time with him in recent days, including one who just rode with him on Air Force One, put themselves into quarantine following exposure to the virus.Also putting himself into isolation was Mark Meadows, the president’s newly designated White House chief of staff.

Mr. Trump made no mention of his own contacts with the affected lawmakers, but his spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, later said the president would not be tested “because he has neither had prolonged close contact” with confirmed patients “nor does he have any symptoms.” But clearly unsettled by the plunging markets and the potential effect on his re-election prospects, Mr. Trump offered an economic response without any new health measures.Speaking with reporters, he said he would meet on Tuesday with Republican congressional leaders to discuss a “very substantial” payroll tax cut and legislation to protect hourly wage earners who miss work because of the virus. He said he would also explore expanding loans by the Small Business Administration. He did not provide any details.“It’s not their fault,” he said of affected workers. “It’s not our country’s fault. This was something that we were thrown into and we’re going to handle it and we have been handling it very well.”He added, “The main thing is that we’re taking care of the American public and we will be taking care of the American public.”The developments came on one of the most jarring days of Mr. Trump’s presidency as markets plummeted, infections rose, schools and universities shut down classes and other nations imposed drastic travel restrictions. With individual lawmakers now heading into isolation, members of Congress contemplated whether it should recess altogether for the foreseeable future to guard against a further spread among the nation’s legislators.

The tension of the day was reflected on Air Force One as it made its way back to Washington from Florida. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, boarded the plane steps behind the president in Orlando, where Mr. Trump held a campaign fund-raiser, only to learn shortly after takeoff that he had been in contact with an infected person at a conservative conference late last month. He then essentially quarantined himself in the air, sitting alone in a compartment of the plane.

As the jet raced toward Washington, its television screens were tuned to Fox News showing the slow-motion progress of a cruise ship with 21 infected passengers heading to a port in Oakland, Calif., followed by overhead cameras under a “Virus Ship Watch” chyron, while a red box in the lower-left-hand corner showed the sinking Dow Jones industrial average, which finished the day down more than 2,000 points, or about 7 percent.Mr. Trump, who regularly invokes the market as an indicator of his success, on Twitter initially blamed the meltdown on falling oil prices and the news media even though most market analysts attributed the bulk of it to concern about the effect of the virus on the global economy. He made no mention of it when he met with reporters in the evening.He did praise his own decision last month to restrict entry to the United States by foreign citizens who had been to China in the previous 14 days.“The big decision was early when we shut down our borders,” he said, overstating the action he took. “We were the first ones ever to do that. We’ve never done that in our country before. We would have a situation that would be a lot more dire.”Mr. Trump has resisted canceling campaign rallies despite other large events being scrubbed, and a campaign aide said he would announce another one on Tuesday. But his campaign on Monday called off a “Women for Trump” bus tour featuring his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, and other top election surrogates, including Mercedes Schlapp, whose husband oversees the Conservative Political Action Conference, after which an attendee tested positive for the virus.That attendee came into contact with Mr. Meadows, Mr. Gaetz and at least three other Republican lawmakers who have now quarantined themselves. The tension of the day was reflected on Air Force One as it made its way back to Washington from Florida. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, boarded the plane steps behind the president in Orlando, where Mr. Trump held a campaign fund-raiser, only to learn shortly after takeoff that he had been in contact with an infected person at a conservative conference late last month. He then essentially quarantined himself in the air, sitting alone in a compartment of the plane.

Mr. Gaetz, who attended events with Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on Friday and Saturday night, met up with the president again on Monday at the Orlando fund-raiser. Mr. Trump then invited Mr. Gaetz to join him on Air Force One back to Washington.In an interview, Mr. Gaetz said that he received a phone call from his chief of staff as the plane was taking off telling him that a picture had been found of him with the infected conference attendee 11 days earlier, meaning he had potentially been exposed to the virus. He said he told John McEntee, a top White House official, and asked to be separated from the other passengers.“He walked me back to a room toward the rear of Air Force One,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I went in there by myself.” A physician traveling with the president then came back and told him that because he had no symptoms 11 days later, he probably had not contracted the virus. But Mr. Gaetz said he remained apart from the rest of the passengers for the rest of the flight.As Air Force One was landing, Mr. Trump summoned him to the front of the plane. “I would not go into his office,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I stood outside of it. He just wanted to see if I was all right, which I am.”He said the president used humor to lighten the situation. “He asked if I needed to be wrapped in cellophane,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I told him that I was willing to jump out of the plane without a parachute if necessary.” He added that he was tested after landing and expects his results back on Tuesday.Mr. Gaetz drew attention last week when he wore a bulky gas mask in the Capitol for the vote on an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus. Days later, a resident of his Florida district died from the coronavirus, prompting some to suggest that he had made light of the risks. Mr. Gaetz denied that, saying he was making a serious point about the risk to lawmakers who interact with so many people.

Mr. Collins was on the tarmac when Mr. Trump landed in Atlanta on Friday and shook the president’s hand before joining him on the tour of the C.D.C. “While I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution,” Mr. Collins wrote on his Twitter feed.

Mr. Meadows was told over the weekend that he, too, might have come into contact with the infected attendee but tested negative, his congressional office said in a statement. “While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,” the statement said.Mr. Trump started Monday playing down the virus, reminding Americans that tens of thousands of people die of the ordinary flu every year. “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,” he wrote on Twitter. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”He dismissed the effect of the outbreak in fueling Monday’s market meltdown. “Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,” he wrote. “That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!” Mr. Meadows was told over the weekend that he, too, might have come into contact with the infected attendee but tested negative, his congressional office said in a statement. “While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,” the statement said.Mr. Trump started Monday playing down the virus, reminding Americans that tens of thousands of people die of the ordinary flu every year. “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,” he wrote on Twitter. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths.

Senior officials engaged in spirited talks last week about whether to warn older Americans against traveling on cruise ships or to go even further than that.As those discussions intensified, at least eight members of the administration’s coronavirus task force, including those with medical backgrounds as well as cabinet officials like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, recommended sending the cruise notice.But two senior White House officials — Joe Grogan, the head of the Domestic Policy Council, and Larry Kudlow, the president’s national economic adviser — argued that they should consider the effects of such a move on 150,000 jobs in Florida, where the tourism industry could be particularly hard hit, according to two senior administration officials. Ultimately, the proponents of a notice won out and the State Department posted it on its website on Sunday.

"BAY CITY, Mich. — When the United Auto Workers went on strike against General Motors last fall, Robby Lamas and those left at the massive engine plant in this Michigan city walked the picket lines day and night. Mr. Lamas, who, at 30, was the youngest at the plant by a decade, was unsure how the public would react to the walkout, his first strike.After all, employment at the plant is now a fraction of what it once was. And not far from anyone’s mind was the fact that Bay County flipped to Republican in 2016, against the wishes of the U.A.W. The county was one of 12 former Democratic strongholds in Michigan that delivered parts of the once impregnable industrial Midwest to Donald J. Trump.Almost four years later, Bay City, the county seat, still has the feel of a traditional labor town. For the 40 days of the GM strike, nearly every car that passed the strikers honked. A steady stream of residents and businesses kept dropping off food, firewood, tents and other supplies. “People were donating stuff all the way to the end,” Mr. Lamas said.But fissures are never far from the surface. Mr. Lamas and some other workers were infuriated that President Trump did not offer support for the strikers. The union instructed them not to talk politics on the picket line, especially after a scuffle broke out between fellow strikers when one of them showed up carrying a Trump 2020 flag.

The union instructed them not to talk politics on the picket line, especially after a scuffle broke out between fellow strikers when one of them showed up carrying a Trump 2020 flag. The strike, the longest national walkout against GM since 1970, symbolized the contradictions and tensions in places like Bay City as Michigan prepares to vote on Tuesday, one of six states holding primaries or caucuses.Mr. Trump often touts a “blue-collar boom.” But there is a sense that residents in Bay County are barely hanging on. The poverty rate increased to almost 15 percent in 2017 from under 10 percent in 1999. Real median earnings for men working full-time and year-round fell about $7,000 in that time, as an ecosystem of factories that held up the Midwest was hollowed out, said Gabriel Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan’s Research Seminar in Qualitative Economics. The plant where Mr. Lamas works now employs fewer than 400 workers, down from nearly 5,000 at its peak.

Barreling down I-75, the north-south expressway that runs from the northern tip of Michigan to Florida, many drivers barely notice Bay City. Anchoring a flat landscape of factories and farms north of Detroit and Flint, this small, unassuming city is perhaps best known for being Madonna’s hometown.It happens to be my hometown as well.I graduated in 1984 from Garber High School, about three miles from the GM plant. Back then, mid-Michigan was just emerging from a recession so severe that some parents of my high school classmates lost their jobs.

Back then, mid-Michigan was just emerging from a recession so severe that some parents of my high school classmates lost their jobs.  Michigan came back then and, like the auto industry, has a history of booms and busts — and surprises. Political observers thought Michigan was a lock for the Democrats in 2016 because it had leaned that way in six previous presidential cycles and because President Barack Obama defied Republicans and bailed out GM and Chrysler during the financial crisis. Many still profess shock that the state went Republican instead. Even nearby Saginaw County, where more than 42 percent of residents are African-Americans, went for Mr. Trump.As the political stakes rise for Michigan, I found myself drawn to my hometown for signals about how 2020 will unfold.In a polarized nation, places like Bay City do not fall into a neat script. Democrats tend to favor gun rights and oppose abortion, which leaves them feeling out of step with the national party. Though young people like Mr. Lamas tend to be strong supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, others prefer former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., worried that a far-left candidate would not fare well in the general election.“This isn’t Ann Arbor or Lansing,” said Jim Barcia, referring to the state’s most liberal college towns. Mr. Barcia, a Democrat, was pressed back into service as Bay County’s county executive in 2016 after retiring after five terms in the House of Representatives.Not long ago, he watched as more than 100 angry residents crowded a meeting demanding that Bay County be declared a “Second Amendment sanctuary” amid talk of an assault weapons ban. “One 70-year-old lady had tears in her eyes,” recalled Mr. Barcia, an avid hunter who has two bucks mounted on his office wall.Asked how Bay City is doing these days, Mr. Barcia, a lifelong resident, points to the 1993 passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and a most favored nation trade pact with China. He estimates that Bay County has lost 7,500 jobs since 2000, almost a tenth of its population.“Much of what we feared ended up happening. I saw our manufacturers disappear,” said Mr. Barcia, who voted against both while in the House. “When Trump talked about trade, it really did resonate with working families.” Michigan came back then and, like the auto industry, has a history of booms and busts — and surprises.

Of the five most common occupations in Bay County, only one — a registered nurse — averages more than $25,000 a year. Manufacturing does not make the top five.“I don’t know anyone who isn’t working two or three jobs or has a side gig,” said Kim Coonan, the owner of Coonan’s Irish Hub, a neighborhood restaurant and bar down the street from the GM Powertrain plant, a backbone of the city since it began making parts for Chevrolet in 1916. “The middle class is gone.”Recently, there has been talk of more layoffs. Most of the stores in the Bay City mall have shuttered. Downtown is dotted with empty storefronts, between restaurants and condominiums that reflect budding efforts to remake the riverfront city into a destination.There are not a lot of Trump signs or MAGA hats visible here. Yet there is evidence of a quiet support for Mr. Trump for being willing to take on China, even if the results have been mixed. Support for labor runs so deep that what is expressed behind closed doors is often different than what is said in public, making political opinion hard to gauge. “People wear masks here,” said one business executive, who asked not to be identified by name.One exception to this rule: the area’s farmers, who are proudly supportive of the president. “In my group of friends, I don’t know anyone who won’t support Trump,” said Brian Johnson, who this year took over the family farm in Pinconning, north of Bay City. He received $80,000 in federal compensation from lost sales in soybeans to China last year, an amount he said prevented him from a financial disaster. For now, it seems that the people who are fortunate enough to have one job — and only one job — are thinking about politics more than others.Jeffrey Bulls works at Nexteer, a Chinese company that bought Saginaw Steering Gear, an auto supplier and a symbol of the shift toward a new global economic order. Purchased by the Chinese out of bankruptcy in 2009, it now employs about 12,000, down from 20,000 at its peak. Mr. Bulls started a podcast in his downtime, “Independent Jeff,” that focuses on issues of concern to African-American voters. “We get taken for granted too much,” Mr. Bulls said.

In this swing region of a swing state, Mr. Bulls senses that any outcome is possible in November, and that much may rest on the struggle so many people have to make ends meet. As I wandered through the region talking to people, it was those stories of getting by that emerged again and again. Uncertain still is which politician gets blamed for that and who benefits. “I don’t know what way it’s going to go this time,” Mr. Bulls said.

Perhaps the biggest one is college.“It’s flipped,” Mr. Harris said.“Until eight to 10 years ago, 60 percent went to a four-year college,” Mr. Harris said. “Now 60 percent go to community college instead.”The biggest reason, he says, is the cost. Michigan has a strong system of state universities. But with tuition and living expenses between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, attending a four-year college is simply not an option for many families.“I get out my phone and start showing them the figures. I tell them, ‘This is the amount of money you will owe,’” Mr. Harris said. “Somebody is going to go into debt. Some of them are shocked.”More than half of the 129 members of the class of 2019 are attending Delta College, a community college where many qualify for aid. Fewer than one-third are attending four-year colleges — and only a small handful are at the state’s top universities. On his bulletin board, Mr. Harris has a sticker touting the University of Michigan’s tuition guarantee for qualified students whose parents make under $60,000. Few students meet both the financial and academic requirements. ‘Somebody is going to go into debt’Bill Harris has seen a lot of changes in his 26 years as a guidance counselor at Garber High School in neighboring Essexville, where I graduated. Perhaps the biggest one is college.“It’s flipped,” Mr. Harris said.“Until eight to 10 years ago, 60 percent went to a four-year college,” Mr. Harris said. “Now 60 percent go to community college instead.”The biggest reason, he says, is the cost. Michigan has a strong system of state universities. But with tuition and living expenses between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, attending a four-year college is simply not an option for many families.“I get out my phone and start showing them the figures. I tell them, ‘This is the amount of money you will owe,’” Mr. Harris said. “Somebody is going to go into debt. Some of them are shocked.”More than half of the 129 members of the class of 2019 are attending Delta College, a community college where many qualify for aid. Fewer than one-third are attending four-year colleges — and only a small handful are at the state’s top universities. On his bulletin board, Mr. Harris has a sticker touting the University of Michigan’s tuition guarantee for qualified students whose parents make under $60,000. Few students meet both the financial and academic requirements. On a recent day, he called in one of the high school’s high-achieving juniors to talk about possibilities, including the University of Michigan scholarship. “Do you know how much your parents make?” Mr. Harris asked Jessica Albrecht, who is 17. She told him that her father is a truck driver, and her mother works in the school district.“I’m smart here, but I’m not sure I would be there,” Ms. Albrecht said of the possibility of the University of Michigan. Still, she seemed intrigued. If her parents’ combined income is under $60,000, Michigan could be a real option, Mr. Harris told her. If not, he said, pausing, as he tried to balance encouragement with reality, it is tougher.For years, young people in this area did not feel a lot of pressure to go to college. They could graduate and get a job at “the shop.” The U.A.W.-negotiated salary was a gateway to a middle-class life that supported places like Bay County, allowing people to marry, have a family, buy a house and, if they could eke out 20 years of service, even own a home or a boat “up north.”“You could have a very nice life,” Mr. Harris, who grew up in Bay City, recalled.Racing from one job to the nextThere is hardly a better place to watch today’s job shuffle than Coonan’s, where office workers, teachers, mechanics and others come to work extra hours as a second, third, even fourth job.The unemployment rate in Bay City is 4.7 percent, but that masks the fact that many jobs simply pay too little to make ends meet.Erin Sitkowski works as an account manager at the F.P. Horak Company, a prominent printing company in Bay City. But when she gets out of work at 5 p.m., she drives as fast as she can across town to reach Coonan’s within 15 minutes. “I knew it was time to get a second job when I was borrowing from my family to make ends meet,” said Ms. Sitkowski, who struggled financially after getting a divorce.

She remains nervous that there could be more reductions.Arianna Whisman is here at Coonan’s, too. This is but one of her four jobs, to pay for college at Saginaw Valley State University. And Kimberly Matula makes $15 an hour as a cook, but that does not go far as a single parent.“I worked two jobs for years, just to make ends meet,” Ms. Matula said. “Really, my kids raised themselves.”She recently took out a high-interest loan to buy a car, but said she was trying to hold things together for her 15-year-old daughter. “We are the blue-collar workers who make the country go around,” she said.‘We are one disaster away’Mr. Johnson’s father, Raymond, who is 65, owns more than 800 acres of farmland in nearby Pinconning. Asked on a recent blustery afternoon whether he was pleased that his son chose farming, too, he did not hesitate. “No, I wish he hadn’t farmed.” There were layoffs at the printing company the other day, and Ms. Sitkowski was upset to see 12 co-workers lose their jobs.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s campaign manager and a circle of allies have seized control of the Republican Party’s voter data and fund-raising apparatus, using a network of private businesses whose operations and ownership are cloaked in secrecy, largely exempt from federal disclosure.Working under the aegis of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, with the cooperation of Trump appointees at the Republican National Committee, the operatives have consolidated power — and made money — in a way not possible in an earlier, more transparent analog era. Since 2017, businesses associated with the group have billed roughly $75 million to the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and a range of other Republican clients.The takeover of the Republican Party’s under-the-hood political machinery parallels the president’s domination of a party that once shunned him, reflected in his speedy impeachment trial and summary acquittal. Elected Republicans have learned the political peril of insufficient fealty. Now, by commanding the party’s repository of voter data and creating a powerful pipeline for small donations, the Trump campaign and key party officials have made it increasingly difficult for Republicans to mount modern, digital campaigns without the president’s support.The process has not been exactly frictionless, shot through with accusations of empire-building and profiteering by the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and his allies. Mr. Parscale’s flagship firm, Parscale Strategy, has billed nearly $35 million to the Trump campaign, the R.N.C. and related entities since 2017 — the vast bulk of it, he says, passed along to advertising and digital firms.

What’s more, the move to consolidate voter data came at the expense of a competing data vehicle developed by the conservative activist Koch brothers, provoking resentment from Koch allies, especially in the Senate. And a fierce pressure campaign to centralize fund-raising on the new platform, a for-profit company that Mr. Trump branded WinRed, brought dissent from candidates initially reluctant to sign on, as well as competitors who believed they were being pushed aside without a fair hearing.For all that, WinRed, created last summer, has given the party an overdue counterweight to ActBlue, the Democrats’ small-donor fund-raising juggernaut. With WinRed, donors could contribute with a few clicks, and candidates could reap windfalls through joint appeals with the president. In its first six months, capitalizing on the Republican base’s outrage over impeachment, WinRed raised $100 million, a fast start, though still well behind the roughly $1 billion raised last year by ActBlue.

The Parscale-led group — including Katie Walsh Shields and her husband, Mike Shields, both former R.N.C. chiefs of staff; and the party’s former digital director, Gerrit Lansing — has also presided over the creation of a number of other political tools, from the president’s affiliated super PACs to a forthcoming party-controlled news app intended to produce cheerleading content.Mr. Parscale declined to comment in detail for this article.

Reince Priebus, then the R.N.C. chairman, offered this blunt assessment: “Our message was weak. Our ground game was insufficient. We weren’t inclusive. We were behind in both data and digital.” While Mr. Trump’s team shredded its core recommendation — a tolerant immigration policy and outreach to women and minorities — it embraced the call for technological change.Previously, parties had spent heavily on television advertising, but now the R.N.C. moved to rebuild around Data Trust, which it had recently helped establish. The idea was compelling: If state and national party committees and campaigns fed information into one place, it could create a deeper understanding of voters. If that place were outside the party, fund-raising limits would not apply. Contractors were fired, and much of the R.N.C.’s data staff was moved into Data Trust, which effectively became an off-campus arm of the party.“Naturally we faced opposition from a lot of the entrenched interests who had business models that benefited from the old way of doing things,” said Mr. Shields, the R.N.C. chief of staff in 2013 and 2014.That included the Koch brothers and their data vehicle, i360, which built personality profiles of millions of voters and was used by a number of campaigns. They weren’t the only skeptics who worried that the committee was steering business to its pet company. Aides to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, believed that Data Trust was inferior to its competitor, and Mr. McConnell gave senators the option of using either.The battle came to a head in mid-2016, when Mr. Priebus and Ms. Walsh-Shields, who had become R.N.C. chief of staff the previous year, visited the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She accused the committee of working against the interests of the party and its presumptive presidential nominee, Mr. Trump. From there, the meeting devolved into shouting, several Republicans with direct knowledge of the clash said.While Ms. Walsh-Shields said in a statement that she did not recall the specific meeting, she added: “I have found that quite often when a woman in a position of power disagrees with a man, it is later referred to as a bad meeting.” While Mr. Trump’s team shredded its core recommendation — a tolerant immigration policy and outreach to women and minorities — it embraced the call for technological change.Previously, parties had spent heavily on television advertising, but now the R.N.C. moved to rebuild around Data Trust, which it had recently helped establish.

But to Mr. Kushner and Mr. Parscale, who by then was the 2020 campaign manager, only one vendor was acceptable, according to several people with knowledge of the deliberations: a company called Revv which had already been processing payments for the campaign. Revv had been co-founded by Mr. Lansing, who was well regarded as a tech-savvy operator and for raising alarms about ActBlue for years. But in 2017, Politico reported that,  after taking over as the R.N.C.’s digital director the year before, he had encouraged Republican campaigns to use Revv, earning a $909,000 payout from the company. Some party veterans viewed this as self-dealing.By the summer of 2019, WinRed was created atop Revv’s platform, but only after negotiations that ended with the Senate campaign committee, and R.N.C. representatives, imposing restrictions that blocked Mr. Lansing from selling WinRed in the future and tightening control of firms he could hire.Mr. Lansing, in a statement, called WinRed “the work of seven months of lawyering to ensure every major stakeholder would be happy with all data, financial and ownership arrangements.”The new company was a joint venture between Revv and Data Trust, with 60 percent of profits going to Revv. (WinRed charges campaigns 3.8 percent, plus 30 cents per credit card transaction.) Officials involved would not detail Mr. Lansing’s remuneration. Mr. Parscale, Ms. Walsh-Shields and Mr. Shields do not own stakes, according to financial records reviewed by The New York Times.WinRed became ascendant, and this time the Trump team and Senate Republicans joined in a pressure campaign to convert holdouts. Mr. McConnell told colleagues at a lunch in mid-2019 that his personal goal was to “shut down all the competitors,” according to one senator who was surprised at the majority leader’s directness. The party even sent a cease-and-desist letter to one of the losing contenders, Anedot, instructing it to remove G.O.P. logos from solicitations. Revv had been co-founded by Mr. Lansing, who was well regarded as a tech-savvy operator and for raising alarms about ActBlue for years. But in 2017, Politico reported that,  after taking over as the R.N.C.’s digital director the year before, he had encouraged Republican campaigns to use Revv, earning a $909,000 payout from the company. Some party veterans viewed this as self-dealing.By the summer of 2019, WinRed was created atop Revv’s platform, but only after negotiations that ended with the Senate campaign committee, and R.N.C. representatives, imposing restrictions that blocked Mr. Lansing from selling WinRed in the future and tightening control of firms he could hire.Mr. Lansing, in a statement, called WinRed “the work of seven months of lawyering to ensure every major stakeholder would be happy with all data, financial and ownership arrangements.”The new company was a joint venture between Revv and Data Trust, with 60 percent of profits going to Revv. (WinRed charges campaigns 3.8 percent, plus 30 cents per credit card transaction.) Officials involved would not detail Mr. Lansing’s remuneration.

With or without a stake in WinRed, key aides have positioned themselves at the center of a formidable political machine. Ms. Walsh-Shields’s consulting firm receives a $25,000-a-month R.N.C. retainer and 1 to 5 percent of money it raises for the party’s 2020 convention. Mr. Shields’s firm, Convergence Media, represents clients ranging from the National Republican Congressional Committee to Representative Devin Nunes of California, one of the president’s staunchest defenders against impeachment.But it is Mr. Parscale who has most often been the focus of Mr. Trump’s complaints that those around him are making too much money from his name and brand. Mr. Parscale has not always discouraged suspicions. A few weeks before the 2016 election, the campaign staff gathered at the Whiskey Trader, a watering hole near Trump Tower, to play beer pong and brace for near-certain defeat. In walked Mr. Parscale, returning from dinner with a new campaign hire.“I’m making so much money!” Mr. Parscale declared, inserting an expletive, according to two people who were present.Mr. Parscale, in a statement, called their account “untrue and ridiculous,” but since his appointment as campaign manager, he has bought a $2.4 million canalside home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; two condos, owned with his family, together worth $2 million; and a Ferrari. A campaign official attributed the spending to Mr. Parscale’s relocation and divestment from businesses in Texas.But after a rival aide left an underlined copy of a Daily Mail story detailing his spending on the president’s desk, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Parscale for a pointed lecture, according to a senior White House official.Others in his circle have made purchases of their own. Mr. Lansing bought a $1.7 million home in Washington last year, while Ms. Walsh-Shields and Mr. Shields bought a $2 million beach house in the Florida panhandle. Asked about the house, Ms. Walsh-Shields referred a reporter to her mother, who said the down payment and mortgage payments had come mostly from her. Mr. Shields had also recently sold the house he owned before their marriage.That Ms. Walsh-Shields has endured is noteworthy. While Vice President Mike Pence said, in a statement, that “we are grateful for her hard work, loyalty and professionalism,” Mr. Trump has privately referred to her as a ‘leaker,’ blaming her for unflattering media coverage during her brief tenure as White House deputy chief of staff in 2017. He has pressed Ronna McDaniel, the party chairwoman, about Ms. Walsh-Shields’s role in recent days. And during a meeting last summer, after prodding by his longtime security consultant, Keith Schiller, the president asked if Ms. McDaniel trusted her, according to people with knowledge of the exchanges. “I do,” Ms. McDaniel replied. “She works for me.” With or without a stake in WinRed, key aides have positioned themselves at the center of a formidable political machine.

Opn Sesame’s specialty is texting voters, a burgeoning and lightly regulated field that is expected to be a factor in the 2020 campaign.To allay Mr. Trump’s concerns, tens of millions of dollars worth of campaign advertising that once ran through Parscale Strategy has been redirected to a new company, American Made Media, which is run by a Parscale lieutenant. There are no public records detailing the company’s financial structure; Mr. Parscale and other advisers said they did not profit from it. Mr. Parscale has declined to provide detailed accounting of his  network of interlocking businesses, and has told associates he follows Mr. Trump’s directive, relayed through Ms. McDaniel, that he make no more than $700,000 or $800,000 for his campaign work.Even to insiders, the campaign’s activities can seem opaque.Last fall, Mr. Pence’s office scheduled his first visit to the headquarters, to get a firsthand look. But when the day came, Mr. Parscale canceled, even though the visit was already on the vice president’s official schedule. Mr. Parscale, who spends much of his time working from his Florida home — though he recently said he would relocate to Washington — told Mr. Pence’s office that the campaign’s landlord had vetoed the idea, fearing a vice-presidential visit would disrupt other tenants. Mr. Pence was puzzled not to learn sooner, and the visit has not been rescheduled, two officials with knowledge of the episode said.For the moment, such concerns are muted as the Trump campaign, the R.N.C. and other affiliated committees raised $155 million in the final three months of 2019, a 23 percent increase over the previous quarter that was buoyed by the impeachment proceedings. The digital operation overseen by Mr. Coby and Mr. Parscale has been developing a series of new products, including a news app for volunteers to dole out Trump-friendly content, republish Trump-world tweets and raffle MAGA hats.

"DEARBORN, Mich. — The second highest, hardest glass ceiling is pretty good too, right?With the Democratic presidential nominee all but certain to be a man, party activists, elected officials and voters are setting their sights on the biggest consolation prize in American politics: the vice presidency.Within hours of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the race, a departure that left the party facing a primary battle between two septuagenarian white men, prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.At least one women’s organization, Supermajority, circulated a petition asking both Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to “affirm their commitment to gender equity” by choosing a woman as their running mate. On Sunday, as he endorsed Mr. Sanders before thousands at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., the Rev. Jesse Jackson called for the next president to pick a black woman as vice president.“There must be a woman on this ticket,” said Cecile Richards, a longtime abortion rights activist and a founder of Supermajority. “What is really important to see is representation, a commitment to the issues that women care about and a commitment to do something about it.” DEARBORN, Mich. — The second highest, hardest glass ceiling is pretty good too, right?With the Democratic presidential nominee all but certain to be a man, party activists, elected officials and voters are setting their sights on the biggest consolation prize in American politics: the vice presidency.Within hours of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the race, a departure that left the party facing a primary battle between two septuagenarian white men, prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.At least one women’s organization, Supermajority, circulated a petition asking both Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R.

They’re unlikely to face much opposition from the candidates: Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say they are considering multiple women for the position.The calls for a female vice president have intensified as the primary has essentially narrowed to a two-man race. Hillary Clinton said she would “love” to see a woman on the ticket but, in an interview with CNN, urged the future nominee to “take a really hard look at the Electoral College for what will help him.”On Sunday, Ms. Harris of California endorsed Mr. Biden, heightening speculation that she could be selected as his running mate. Despite a bitter competition, Mr. Biden remains fond of Ms. Harris, in part because she was friends with his late son Beau Biden when they both served as state attorneys general.“I believe in Joe,” she said in a video posted on Twitter. “I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time.” The selection of a female vice president, particularly one of color, would offer a fitting coda to a presidential primary where racial and gender representation has taken second place to concerns about defeating President Trump.Even when the female candidates were still in the race, people at town hall meetings and campaign rallies often suggested Ms. Warren or Senator Kamala Harris as possible No. 2s on a ticket, as a way of providing a dose of history-making enthusiasm without what many voters viewed as the risk of having a woman lead the ticket.

The former second lady described Ms. Harris’s debate-stage attacks on Mr. Biden’s record on race as a “punch to the gut.” She offered more praise for Senator Amy Klobuchar, who endorsed Mr. Biden last week, calling her “an incredible woman.” His wife expressed a slightly less glowing view of the California senator.At a Friday fund-raiser in the Chicago suburbs, a largely female audience shouted suggestions for vice-presidential nominees to Jill Biden, with many arguing the pick should be a woman.

While academics, activists and officials seeking to promote women in politics embrace the idea that a qualified woman could become vice president, some also cringe at being encouraged to settle for silver after spending a year competing hard for the gold.“In the current political environment, it looks tone deaf to have an all-white, all-male ticket,” said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on women in politics. “There’s no question that the notion of a female V.P. is used as a strategy and I think that’s a little bit sexist. It’s sort of like an ‘insert woman here’ kind of conversation.”People close to both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say their campaigns see strong political arguments for putting a woman on the ticket, believing such a choice could generate enthusiasm from female voters who make up the backbone of the party and sharpen their contrast with Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen women.Women remain Mr. Trump’s staunchest opponents, with large majorities consistently giving him some of the lowest marks in polling. His presidency has inspired the largest gender gap in history and supercharged turnout among female Democrats.

Only two have been nominated: Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska by the Republican Party in 2008 and Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro by Democrats in 1984.Putting a woman on the ticket could also move the country closer to electing a first female president. If elected, the female vice president could later find herself in a stronger position to win the presidency than any woman in American history.A vocal segment of the party argues that the vice-presidential slot must go not just to any woman but specifically to a black woman, given the crucial support African-American women have given to the Democrats in recent elections. Over the past three years, the overwhelming backing of black women helped the party recapture control of the House and flip Senate and governor’s seats in deep-red states like Louisiana and Alabama.“African-American women have been the most loyal supporters of Democratic candidates,” said Representative Barbara Lee of California, a former chairwoman of Ms. Harris’s campaign. “It’s time we have an African-American woman as vice president.”Nikema Williams, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Georgia, put it simply: “A black woman on the ticket is the margin of victory.”Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic Senate leader, is particularly focused on the idea, arguing that such a pick could help unite the party after a divisive primary, according to people who have spoken with Mr. Schumer.

Mr. Schumer isn’t the only party official intrigued by the idea of putting a black woman on the ticket. Some close to Mr. Biden are urging him to pick a nominee who could protect his support among black voters, whose strong support has helped him capture the lead in the primary race.Women of various backgrounds have been suggested as possible running mates for Mr. Biden.He recently named Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan as a national co-chair of his campaign. Other names that have been floated by Mr. Biden or those around him include Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader who narrowly lost a race for governor last year; Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general who became a Democratic icon after being fired by Mr. Trump early in his term; Ms. Klobuchar; and Senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, is seeking a woman who agrees with his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.” With many of his top female surrogates, including Representatives Ilhan Omar, Pramila Jayapal and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, disqualified from seeking the presidency because of their age or foreign birthplace, Ms. Warren is one of a few elected officials who fit the criteria, according to some close to the Sanders campaign.Following in the long tradition of possible vice-presidential picks, the women in the midst of all the chatter have largely declined to comment on whether they’ve been approached about the job. Ms. Whitmer said that she raised the issue of representation with Mr. Biden and planned to participate in all aspects of the campaign — including vetting possible running mates. Ms. Abrams recently said that she planned to be president by 2040 but would consider vice president in the meantime.

While little academic research has been done on female vice presidents, there’s plenty of data from business and economics that suggests women are more likely to be overlooked for chief executive positions and other top jobs. As in politics, it’s harder for assertive, ambitious women to be seen as likable, and easier to conclude they lack some intangible, ill-defined quality of leadership, the data shows.Yet there’s also little evidence that vice presidents — male or female — have a significant impact on converting undecided voters, despite all the thought campaigns put into selecting presidential running mates. Studies of the 2008 race found that while Ms. Palin shored up her party’s evangelical base, she did little to help John McCain, the Republican nominee, win over independent or Democratic-leaning women.“The research on the importance of the vice president is pretty compelling in that there’s a lot of strategy that goes into the pick and not a lot of evidence that it matters,” Dr. Lawless said.For months, both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have indicated that they are likely to select a female candidate. In February, Mr. Sanders said his campaign would select someone “maybe not of the same gender that I am.”During a town hall event in November, Mr. Biden floated four possible vice-presidential picks. All were women. He has also said both Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris would be on his list of potential picks.Last spring, weeks before Mr. Biden announced his bid, his advisers discussed naming either Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris to the ticket early, perhaps even before he captured the nomination. The unusual move was considered as a way to build enthusiasm and reassure voters about his age.A few weeks later, Ms. Harris pushed back, noting that Mr. Biden, in turn, would be an asset as the No. 2 on the ticket: “As vice president, he’s shown he can do the job.”Lisa Lerer reported from Dearborn, Mich., and Reid J.

In February, Mr. Sanders said his campaign would select someone “maybe not of the same gender that I am.”During a town hall event in November, Mr. Biden floated four possible vice-presidential picks. All were women. He has also said both Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris would be on his list of potential picks.Last spring, weeks before Mr. Biden announced his bid, his advisers discussed naming either Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris to the ticket early, perhaps even before he captured the nomination. The unusual move was considered as a way to build enthusiasm and reassure voters about his age.A few weeks later, Ms. Harris pushed back, noting that Mr. Biden, in turn, would be an asset as the No. 2 on the ticket: “As vice president, he’s shown he can do the job.”Lisa Lerer reported from Dearborn, Mich., and Reid J.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Monday night issued several pages of tips for navigating the coronavirus, organizing a set of recommendations for schools, businesses, homes and offices into a document that resembles easy-on-the-eye restaurant food-safety charts.The simple behaviors recommended in the guidelines — like washing hands, managing air flow, protecting food and carving out private space in a home — show how federal health officials believe the virus could influence everyday life.“These are really simple, low-tech things,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, said at a White House news briefing. “There’s nothing in there that’s complicated. But it’s just stated in a way that’s clear, that people can understand.”After the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence posted images of the guidelines on Twitter.

Here is what the guidelines recommend.How to navigate the officeStay home if you or family members who live with you are sick. Several top health officials have repeatedly urged Americans to not risk going to work if they come down with symptoms that might indicate an infection.Use the usual electronic means of work life, like email, to remind yourself to wash your hands. Devise ways to remember to not touch your face. And avoid shaking hands — “noncontact methods of greeting” are preferable.Instead of in-person meetings, the guidelines suggest teleconferencing. If meetings are held in person, they should be in open, well-ventilated rooms. Open windows will help.The World Health Organization warns that “poorly ventilated buildings affect air quality and can contribute to the spread of disease,” and that in health facilities with a high concentration of infectious patients, poor ventilation worsens the risk of transmission.How to divide a homeDivvy up your home to account for the elderly or those with underlying conditions that make them particularly susceptible to infection. Make a “protected space” for those at risk, and give the sick their own rooms, where the door should be kept closed. Only one person should care for the ill.

The next day he plunged Saudi Arabia into a price war with Russia that sent energy and stock markets around the world into free fall.For a while, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia had appeared to be living down his reputation for dangerous aggression.Perhaps chastened by the blowback over his connection with the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the 34-year-old crown prince had kept a low profile for more than a year.Now his new power plays are reviving debates in Western capitals about whether he is too rash to trust as a partner. His sudden, steep cut to the price of oil has rocked a global economy already at risk of falling into recession, threatened to burn through Saudi Arabia’s cash reserves and undermined his grandiose promises of new investments to lessen the kingdom’s dependence on oil.

Their arrests stirred anxious speculation among cowed members of the royal family that Crown Prince Mohammed might be sidelining opponents in preparation for taking the throne from his father, who is 84 and has sometimes appeared forgetful or disoriented. “It is mutually assured destruction for any oil exporting economy, certainly including Saudi Arabia and Russia and probably the United States as well,” said Greg Brew, a scholar of the region and a fellow at Southern Methodist University.“But this is typical MBS, right?” he added, referring to the crown prince by his initials. “He is a risk taker, and he is prone to impulsive decisions.”The detention of the senior royals, which began to leak out on Friday, has not been acknowledged or explained by the Saudi officials.Two of the detained princes — Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of the crown prince’s aging father, King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister — had once been seen as possible rivals for power.

He wanted to teach the rest of the family a lesson. People close to the royal court, though, insisted the crown prince had merely lashed out at his uncle and cousins for speaking critically about him. He wanted to teach the rest of the family a lesson. “It was quiet for a while and people were wondering if MBS had mellowed,” Steffen Hertog, a scholar at the London School of Economics, said. “But clearly his character is pretty persistent.”Prince Mohammed slashed the oil price to punish Russia, which he faulted for failing to cooperate in cutting production and propping up prices. The slowdown caused by the coronavirus was already reducing demand for oil.“The Russians called their bluff, and now the Saudis are trying to demonstrate to the Russians what the cost is of a lack of cooperation,” Professor Hertog said. But for Saudi Arabia, “it is a risky game of chicken.”Saudi Arabia has much more to lose than Russia. Russia has more diverse sources of revenue and it has built up its reserves since the last oil price downturn.Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, remains overwhelmingly dependent on oil. What’s more, its cash reserves have remained flat for about four years at around $500 billion, down from a peak of about $740 billion in the summer of 2014.Analysts say that the kingdom needs a so-called break-even price of about $80 a barrel to meet its budget without either further drawing down those reserves or adopting painful austerity measures. But the price on Monday fell to about $35 a barrel, less than half the break-even price. “It was quiet for a while and people were wondering if MBS had mellowed,” Steffen Hertog, a scholar at the London School of Economics, said. “But clearly his character is pretty persistent.”Prince Mohammed slashed the oil price to punish Russia, which he faulted for failing to cooperate in cutting production and propping up prices.

But the price on Monday fell to about $35 a barrel, less than half the break-even price. A downturn of as much as two years could cut into those reserves severely enough to put pressure on the Saudi exchange rate as well as the plans to diversify the economy, Professor Hertog said.The crown prince’s economic plan for the country centered on a public offering of shares in the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, to raise money to invest in other sectors. But plans for a debut on a major international market were pulled in favor of the more lax Saudi domestic exchange, and over the last two days the oil price cut has sent shares tumbling by 20 percent, shaving $320 billion off the value of the company.The timing of the price war so soon after the roundup of his royal relatives on Friday has aroused speculation that the crown prince sought to contain potential opponents in anticipation of trouble. Perhaps he wanted to pre-empt any foes before economic pain from the downturn made him politically vulnerable, some suggested.“The threat to MBS is not coming from his royal rivals,” argued Kristin Smith Diwan, a scholar at the Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It is coming from the collapse in oil revenues and what that does to his ambitious economic plans.”But other analysts, former diplomats and officials with experience in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis close to the royal court said that Prince Mohammed had consolidated power so thoroughly that he had little left to fear.With a level of ruthlessness unprecedented in modern Saudi history, the crown prince has seized more direct power over the kingdom than any monarch in decades, largely by intimidating into submission his own sprawling ruling family. Even in a severe downturn, the members of the royal family he detained had little hope of challenging him.

He had already put the same royals under tight surveillance, limiting their ability to plot against him, according to people close to the royal court.A spokesman for the Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.The most senior figure detained, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, more than 70 years old, had once been recorded in London making comments distancing himself from the crown prince’s policies but had since appeared submissive, at least in public.The other prominent royal detained, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, had already been under house arrest since 2017, when he was removed from his posts as crown prince and interior minister by the current crown prince.Previous Saudi rulers might have provided some advance warning to Washington and London before such high profile detentions, former diplomats said. Crown Prince Mohammed had met in Riyadh last week with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab of Britain and last month with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Yet the crown prince gave no indication that the arrests were imminent, according to diplomats and other officials with knowledge of the matter.

Western officials worry about the “reputational risk” of associating with such an unpredictable leader, said Emile Hokayem, a scholar at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. But so far Prince Mohammed has faced few adverse consequences. He has led a five-year military intervention in Yemen that has produced a humanitarian catastrophe. He rounded up hundreds of his royal relatives and other wealthy Saudis in a Ritz Carlton hotel in 2017 to squeeze them for repayment of what he claimed was self enrichment. He even temporarily kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and forced him to announce a resignation (which the prime minister later retracted).American intelligence agencies concluded that in 2018 Prince Mohammed ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist who lived in Virginia.Since then, some analysts have seen signs of maturation, in particular his pulling back from a potential armed clash with his nemesis, Iran, last year.

Even as Mr. Biden is heading a bandwagon with former 2020 rivals and moderate Democratic voters clambering aboard, Mr. Sanders has a loyal base that is emotionally bound to him, an attachment rooted in their own economic struggles and lived experiences, rather than triangulating the most electable candidate.Tuesday’s primary contests, in six states including Missouri and Washington, are unfolding against a backdrop of high anxiety over the economic and health consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. For most Sanders voters, plummeting stock prices matter less than the broader injustices he champions around wage inequality, health care and student loan debt.If Mr. Sanders defies expectations in Michigan, a state he won in the 2016 primary, it will be because his all-out efforts here over the last four days succeeded in broadening his support, reversing the demographic trends that broke against him on Super Tuesday.

Mr. Booker endorsed the former vice president on Monday. Earlier he sent Senator Amy Klobuchar for a couple of low-key events.“If you look at what Joe’s running here versus what we’re running here,” Bill Neidhardt, a Sanders spokesman, said over the weekend, “they’ll send a surrogate or two out here, but we’re going to have Bernie talk to as many people as possible, and then we’re going to have door knockers talk to as many people as possible.”On Sunday, according to campaign counts, Mr. Sanders drew crowds of more than 7,000 in Grand Rapids, where the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the two-time presidential candidate, endorsed him, and over 10,000 in Ann Arbor, where he was introduced by America’s second most popular democratic socialist, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.“In order for us to win we have to grow, we must be inclusive, we must bring more people into this movement,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.One possible sign of progress in widening his coalition is that former supporters of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week but has yet to make an endorsement, were not hard to find in the Sanders multitudes.

He remembered “during the Clinton administration where I made like 80, 90 grand, but apparently that was too much.”His wife, Kim, who lost her job as an education administrator in January, said: “I was just thinking this morning, my dad, he was 58 when he retired from the telephone company. He had a very nice retirement. Belonged to the union. And here I am 55 and nowhere near to retiring.”Younger voters often brought up the huge burden of college debt for their generation, which Mr. Sanders proposes to cancel.

They revealed that Mr. Sanders has not overcome his weakness with black voters. Despite years of outreach to African-Americans since his loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic race, Mr. Sanders saw black voters choosing his rival in Southern states on Super Tuesday.He won Michigan that year — the high-water mark of his campaign — by carrying white voters, especially whites without a college degree, who represented more than one in three voters. Winning those voters again not just in Michigan but in Ohio and Illinois, which vote on March 17, undergirds Mr. Sanders’s hope for a comeback.His TV ads and his speeches hammer Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement, reviled by many factory workers, and for past statements suggesting an openness to cutting Social Security.

He is hopeful, if not entirely optimistic, that Mr. Sanders can again win working-class white voters in Michigan, many of whom in 2016 may have been voting against Mrs. Clinton and have since been lost to President Trump.“I hope that people actually stop and listen to what he actually has to say, instead of the party lines,” Mr. Chatters said. “Sometimes people are so swayed by the term ‘socialism’ when they’re driving on their free roads, they’re taking their kids to the free school.”In the Super Tuesday primaries, it was Mr. Biden who won working-class white voters, helping him to carry Northern states including Maine and Minnesota, an ominous sign for Mr. Sanders. Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said he was skeptical of Mr. Sanders’s ability to repeat his 2016 Michigan win, or his chances elsewhere in the Midwest, because Democrats this year, who singularly want to beat Mr. Trump, are less open to revisiting arguments over trade or Social Security.“Voters, astonishingly, have taken over the nominating process,” he said. “Biden did well among blacks, suburban whites and white working-class voters because they want him to take on Trump.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Senator Bernie Sanders has a problem winning over black voters.It was clear in 2016, when he stumbled on issues of race and faced protests from Black Lives Matter activists.It was clear after the Super Tuesday contests last week, when Joe Biden cruised to victory on the strength of his decisive margins among black voters in Virginia, North Carolina and other states. And as the race moves to Michigan, Florida, Illinois and other delegate-rich, diverse states, it’s becoming even clearer that Mr. Sanders’s failure to win significant support with black voters could end up dooming his second primary bid.As I traveled with the Sanders campaign across Michigan this past weekend, he drew huge crowds, as he often does. But they were overwhelmingly white.Those demographics were stark in a state where black voters are expected to make up nearly a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate on Tuesday.Clearly, the Sanders campaign wants to expand beyond its base. At seven rallies over three days, it showcased a diverse array of supporters, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the celebrity academic Cornel West.In Grand Rapids, Mr. Sanders accepted the endorsement of a man he called “one of the true heroes of modern America,” the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Like Mr. Sanders hopes to do, Mr. Jackson used a surprise victory in Michigan to buoy his 1988 presidential bid.

Jesse Jackson. Like Mr. Sanders hopes to do, Mr. Jackson used a surprise victory in Michigan to buoy his 1988 presidential bid. (Fun deep cut: In the Vermont caucuses that year, Mr. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was “slapped by an irate citizen after casting his vote” for Mr. Jackson.)Yet, at a town-hall meeting in Flint, billed as an opportunity for Mr. Sanders to make a case directly to black voters, the Vermont senator refused to discuss issues of particular concern to black Americans. Instead, before yet another overwhelmingly white audience, he ceded the stage to African-American surrogates who delivered a series of searing attacks on Mr. Biden’s record.His campaign said Mr. Sanders had scrapped his speech in order to “lift up” the voices of the black panelists.“Bernie does not have those experiences,” a campaign spokesman said. “He’s a white Jewish man.”Presidents, of course, have to talk about all kinds of issues affecting all kinds of people — whether they have direct experience with them or not. No president, for example, has ever given birth.Mr. Sanders has shown little hesitation in expressing his opinions on issues impacting Latinos, women or L.G.B.T.Q. Americans. (And he has found success with Latino voters, who make up just a sliver of the Michigan electorate.) Yet, while Mr. Sanders rattles off policy positions on issues like criminal justice, housing and education, he seems less comfortable driving a message around racial justice and the lived experiences of African-Americans.Part of the problem Mr. Sanders may face is fundamental: His campaign is deeply rooted in his democratic socialism, focused heavily on class as the root of all the country’s ills. Racial discrimination is a byproduct of economic inequality, rather than the cause, in Mr. Sanders’s telling.From Flint to Ann Arbor, Mr. Sanders cast his campaign as a unifying cause for working-class Americans, focused heavily on economic issues like the cost of college, unions, health care and low wages. He talks far less and in far less explicit terms about racial injustice.

The next morning, Mr. Jackson delivered a message focused on racial injustice, even calling for Mr. Sanders to put a black woman on the ticket.As I watched Mr. Jackson address thousands gathered in downtown Grand Rapids, I couldn’t help but think about what a fascinating political moment this must be for him. His dream of a “rainbow coalition” has been realized in today’s Democratic Party.

In the majority of states, those people have not yet been elected by the party. That’s a process that typically happens at state party conventions well after the initial primaries or caucuses. When that happens, the delegates that are allocated based on statewide results — about 25 percent of the total — will just be reallocated to candidates still remaining in the race.The remaining 75 percent, which are allocated based on congressional district results, are technically still the property of the candidate who won them. But the actual delegates — meaning the humans — are not legally bound, so they’re likely to just vote for someone still in the race, probably the person whom their original candidate endorsed. That process typically happens with some behind-the-scenes coordination between the two campaigns (the one still operating and the one that ended).This reshuffling is a standard process in Democratic presidential politics and is part of the reason Democrats haven’t had a contested convention in decades. In 2016, some states unanimously announced that they backed Hillary Clinton at the party convention, even though she didn’t win all the delegates from those states.

"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preparing to unveil a sweeping plan to lower the cost of health care, moving to address the top concern of voters while giving moderate Democrats who face tough re-election races a way to distance themselves from the Medicare for All plan embraced by the progressive left and derided by Republicans as socialism.The legislation, timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, is part of a major push by Democrats to position themselves as the party of health care before the 2020 elections. Former President Barack Obama will support the effort, appearing with Ms. Pelosi at American University in Washington on March 23, 10 years to the day he signed the Affordable Care Act into law.While the measure has little chance of survival in the Republican-controlled Senate, it is the latest evidence that Democratic leaders, determined to protect their House majority and the moderate lawmakers who helped them to power, are looking for ways to distinguish their rank and file from the party’s presidential nominees.The plan bears no resemblance to Medicare for All, the national health insurance system championed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the self-described democratic socialist. And it omits a “public option” to create a government-run health insurer, an idea embraced by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner.

And it omits a “public option” to create a government-run health insurer, an idea embraced by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner. In steering clear of the ideas promoted by both leading presidential candidates, Ms. Pelosi is hoping to protect the so-called front-liners who flipped Republican seats in 2018 and delivered Democrats the majority.The speaker’s new proposal is aimed at reducing costs under the current health bill, according to people familiar with it, who insisted on anonymity to describe a plan that was not yet public. Details are still being finalized, and Ms. Pelosi — who was to meet Monday evening with Democratic committee chairs to discuss a response to the coronavirus epidemic — has not yet shared them with her rank and file. The speaker’s office declined to comment.The plan could be unveiled as early as this week, though coronavirus could upend that timeline. In eschewing Medicare for All, Ms. Pelosi is turning away from a proposal that does not have the votes to pass the House and has divided Democrats on Capitol Hill.Instead, the speaker is expected to propose a series of steps to make health care more cost-effective under the Affordable Care Act, including expanding tax credits and subsidies to help people buy insurance and creating a national program to help cover expenses for those with medical conditions. The plan is expected to spotlight ideas put forth by vulnerable freshmen like Representatives Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Angie Craig of Minnesota.But Ms. Pelosi’s reluctance to embrace Mr. Sanders’s bold vision may draw the ire of her caucus’ left wing, which is pushing for a vote on Medicare for All. Her decision to shy away from the public option is especially notable, given that the House included such a system when it passed its version of the Affordable Care Act in 2019. The provision was later stripped out by the Senate.

That unifies the country and unifies the party,” Mr. Dach said. “What we have had is a debate with tremendous missed opportunities. Democrats should have been up there reminding people what Donald Trump has been doing to their health care, not arguing as much about where they want to go.”Polls show the public is deeply concerned about the high cost of health care but divided over what to do about it. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a slight majority of respondents — 53 percent — favored a Medicare for All approach that would cover everyone on a single government plan. A much larger majority, 65 percent, favored a public option.Republicans have latched onto Mr. Sanders and Medicare for All as a way to paint Democrats as socialists, a strategy that is unlikely to change no matter what proposal Ms. Pelosi puts forth or who becomes the Democratic nominee. “No one is opposed to a pragmatic step that’s feasible,” he said. “What we’re opposed to is a lack of imagination and boldness in not giving a vote on policies that economics and health experts are saying is what the country needs.”But Leslie Dach, a Democratic strategist and the chairman of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group, said it was important for Democrats to spotlight what they could agree on, especially after a string of presidential primary debates where Democrats beat up one another over their health care plans instead of going after President Trump.“If you do the polling, 80 percent of the people want to lower costs, and they want to protect critical things like pre-existing conditions.

Such positions, he said, “make the argument that Democrats have become socialists a particularly effective one, no matter how much they now try to run away from it.”The Affordable Care Act anniversary comes as the law itself is in fresh peril. It has survived numerous Republican attempts and a vow by Mr. Trump to repeal it, as well as a string of court challenges.But the Supreme Court, which has twice ruled to leave most of the provisions intact, recently agreed to hear a third case, which could wipe out the Affordable Care Act entirely. When Democrats took over the House in January 2019, they voted to intervene in the case, Texas v. U.S., which was brought by conservative state attorneys general seeking to overturn the law.Democrats campaigned aggressively in 2018 on lowering costs and protecting health coverage, and they have already taken some steps to make good on those promises.In May, they passed legislation to reverse Trump administration rules that allowed the expansion of health care plans that did not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act’s mandated coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. And in December, the House voted to lower the rising cost of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers.But like most legislation passed by House Democrats, the two health bills are languishing in the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, refuses to take them up. “Voters have watched as the Democratic Party has moved further and further left, to the point where now a majority of their members support canceling private health care entirely for BernieCare,” said Dan Conston, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee affiliated with House Republicans.

It would create a so-called reinsurance program, which would provide government funds to help insurers offset the cost of patients with expensive medical conditions. And it would make subsidies more generous for people with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty line.Other Democrats, including Ms. Underwood and Ms. Craig, have put forth similar ideas.

"PHOENIX — “This is a campaign of the working class, by the working class and for the working class!”Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont nearly shouted those words to a raucously supportive crowd here last week. The line received thunderous applause, as it always does.At campaign events over the past year, Mr. Sanders has spoken to tens of thousands of people who come to hear his message of political revolution — who come to imagine a country with universal health care, no student debt and a $15 minimum wage. Almost every line he says onstage rises to a crescendo, inviting cheers of appreciation. With every promise and policy proposal, the crowd becomes a sea of waving blue and white signs with the “Bernie” logo.The Sanders campaign has exposed a class divide within the Democratic Party: His promises of a leg up are most alluring to those who need it, and most confounding to those who do not.

Six more states go to the polls on Tuesday in what is now a head-to-head matchup in the Democratic presidential race between Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The path for Mr. Sanders to retake a delegate lead is much narrower than it was a week ago, but no matter how the primaries turn out for Mr. Sanders, he has built a fierce following of voters who want and expect more from their party, from their government, from their country.

That’s how Audrey Yanos views Mr. Sanders and this political moment. Ms. Yanos, a 39-year-old medical administrator, has voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election in her adult life. But Ms. Yanos has misgivings: Those Democrats, she believes, have never done all that much to deliver the promise of the American dream. She has begun to feel that the country has betrayed people like her.Mr. Sanders, she says, is different. Ms. Yanos voted for him in 2016, and did so again last Tuesday in the Colorado primary, which he won easily over Mr. Biden.“We are struggling all the time, and what we have is not working,” she said one evening last week during a brief break between dinner and her son’s basketball practice. “We’re all scraping by, one disaster away from real catastrophe, and we need someone who understands that.” That’s how Audrey Yanos views Mr. Sanders and this political moment.

If the Democratic Party wants to keep such voters engaged and committed to showing up in the fall, leaders will have to speak more directly to them and better address their needs.Many of his supporters know what it’s like to struggle in one way or another. They need prescription drugs but can’t afford them. They are buried under relentless student debt. They juggle jobs with caring for ailing parents or young children, or both. They want better lives, more stable lives, and need some help.When Mr. Sanders has asked people at his town halls to tell their stories — often by prodding them to share their insurance premiums or deductibles — their voices have sometimes shaken. Sometimes there are tears.

Sometimes there are tears. Ms. Yanos was the first person in her family to attend college. She considers herself lucky because a scholarship paid for tuition and books, so she graduated with about $25,000 in debt, which she paid off last year. Financially, she is far better off than her parents were when she was a child. And yet she sees no evidence of a booming economy in her own life.“I look around and see so many other people barely holding on,” Ms. Yanos said, choking back tears as her kids did their homework at the kitchen table. “It’s not that I think it will be all rainbows and sunshine if he’s elected, things won’t change overnight. But people younger than me, they are going to demand change in their lifetime.”Everything seemed to be clicking for Mr. Sanders before last week. He had finished at the top of the nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, then dominated in Nevada. But on Super Tuesday, a surging Mr. Biden all but extinguished that momentum, winning 10 of 14 states with the support of many black working-class voters. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are now heading into primaries in Michigan and other major Midwestern states that are favorable in many ways to the former vice president. But Mr. Sanders also enjoys plenty of support in these states, particularly from white working-class voters. Ms. Yanos was the first person in her family to attend college.

In both of his bids for the White House, Mr. Sanders has shown that his populist message resonates in some corners, even as it repels much of the Democratic establishment, which has steadily lined up behind Mr. Biden. Rallies for Mr. Sanders often resemble rock concerts, drawing tens of thousands of people who come decked out in campaign gear, with T-shirts that proclaim “Unidos con Bernie” and signs that say “Not me, Us.”Polling throughout the campaign has shown Mr. Sanders drawing some of his strongest support from voters with household incomes under $50,000; his numbers taper off as incomes rise. A month ago, when he was leading in the polls, people with household incomes of $50,000 and under supported Mr. Sanders twice as much as any other candidate. At that time, he commanded the support of most Democratic voters making $100,000 and under.Exit polls on Super Tuesday did not ask respondents directly about their income. But in the three states where he won and exit polls were conducted — Colorado, Vermont and California — Mr. Sanders performed five to eight percentage points better among those without a college degree than those with one. In Massachusetts and Minnesota, both states he had hoped to win but ended up losing decisively to Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders’s numbers among college graduates lagged his showing among those without degrees by double digits.“Bernie is the only candidate I’ve ever felt a connection to, in a sense that he genuinely cares about the working class in a way that no other candidate has ever shown support to us,” said Andrew Hilbert, 26, who came to see Mr. Sanders in Phoenix.Mr. Sanders’s support this year has proved particularly enduring in the West, where many communities remain visibly scarred by the Great Recession. And his focus on the working class helps explain part of his appeal to Latino voters, who are disproportionately young and are more likely to come from a working-class background. Many such voters point to the illusion of an “up by your bootstraps” mentality and strongly believe that the only way to create a fair economy is to drastically change the way the current one works.“We’ve had decades of policies fail to meet our needs, and we’ve got to break that cycle,” said Antonio Arellano, the executive director of Jolt, a group in Texas that focuses on turning out young Latino voters and that endorsed Mr. Sanders. “What we’re seeing for the first time ever is the courage to break from the past and radically build the future.

Ms. Estrada calls herself a “romantic but pragmatic” socialist, and said she was not all that optimistic that Mr. Sanders would win the primary, let alone the presidency. Her biggest hope, she said, is that he is ushering in a new era of politics with more of a focus on the poor.

Like other Latino supporters of the Vermont senator, Ms. Estrada views herself as part of a movement that will live on regardless of his political fate, and that harks back to the Chicano movement of the 1960s and ’70s. “This is a country that wants the current class structure to stay in place, and it’s really hard to fight against that.”Many working-class supporters point to Mr. Sanders’s opposition to the Iraq war as the initial issue that drew them into his orbit.

"WASHINGTON — North Korea has evaded United Nations sanctions for many months by exporting coal, sand and petroleum, and importing luxury goods including armored sedans, alcohol and robotic machinery. The findings are based on an upcoming U.N. report, other assessments using satellite images and shipping data, and interviews with analysts.The exports provide North Korea with money to continue developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, analysts say. And the imports of luxury goods show techniques that North Korea might also be using to procure dual-use technology for those programs, they say. The efforts to raise money are aided by the country’s sophisticated cybercrime operations that target financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges.The upcoming annual report from the United Nations Panel of Experts gives more detail on the smuggling of two armored Mercedes sedans that were shipped from the Netherlands to East Asia in 2018 and that were the subject of an investigation by The New York Times and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in July.The U.N. panel did its own investigation after the article and video appeared, and concluded that the cars were shipped from Europe after they were in the possession of two Italian companies — apparently the start of the supply chain, according to a draft of the report seen by The Times. The United Nations is expected to release the report this month.

In December, the two nations proposed to the United Nations an easing of sanctions.American officials and analysts cite satellite images that show transfers involving North Korean ships in Chinese territorial waters as evidence of efforts to evade the sanctions.“The Chinese have to enforce the sanctions against North Korea. They’ve got to stop the ship-to-ship transfers,” Robert C. O’Brien, President Trump’s national security adviser, said last month. “We need the Chinese to assist us as we pressure the North Koreans to come to the table,” he added.

The United States has pushed the United Nations to pass five rounds of sanctions resolutions since 2016.Mr. Trump has made diplomacy with North Korea a signature foreign policy initiative. But American officials are frustrated that the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has rejected outreach from Washington since a round of talks between negotiators ended abruptly in Stockholm last October. That came after the failure of the second summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February 2019.The porous sanctions mean the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against North Korea is far from effective, and American officials are losing what they say is their only real leverage. That could help explain Pyongyang’s recent cold shoulder toward Washington, experts say.

Mr. Kim surprised American officials this winter by not sending what North Korean officials had called a potential “Christmas gift” to Mr. Trump — possibly a test of a nuclear weapon or an intercontinental ballistic missile. In early 2019, Mr. Kim had given Mr. Trump a year-end deadline to lift sanctions.The successful evasion of sanctions might mean less urgency on Mr. Kim’s part in getting the penalties lifted. He continues to get revenue while building up his stockpile of fissile material, adding to the amount he already has for about 38 nuclear warheads, according to a recent estimate by Siegfried S. Hecker, the former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.North Korea has continued to carry out tests of short-range ballistic missiles and rocket systems, with no admonishment from Mr. Trump. On Monday, North Korea launched multiple projectiles off its east coast in the country’s second weapons test in a week. Before Monday’s tests, it fired two short-range projectiles off its east coast on March 2, its first weapons test in three months.

The draft of the U.N. report says North Korea conducted 13 missile tests and launched 25 missiles in 2019. (Reuters first reported on parts of the U.N. study last month.)It is unclear how the global crisis over the new coronavirus, which began in China, will affect North Korea. The country has not reported any cases, but experts say there most likely are some. North Korea has closed almost all border entry points and put foreigners in the country under quarantine, but is now asking them to leave. Last month, the United States approved the transfer of humanitarian aid, and the United Nations has allowed some exemptions to sanctions for aid.“On the North Korean side, they have asked for assistance and will need to coordinate points of entry for the urgent supplies with the aid organizations,” said Kee Park, a Korean-American doctor who regularly leads medical delegations to North Korea.North Korean leaders might have to use some of the revenue accrued from smuggling for social welfare needs, if they are not doing so already.Some analysts say the visit to North Korea in June by President Xi Jinping of China might have marked a turning point in sanctions enforcement.“Given the deterioration of U.S.-China ties, Beijing’s leaders are in no mood to cooperate with Washington on North Korea issues,” said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst on North Korea who is now at the Brookings Institution. “And judging from the opening of new resort and tourism areas and robust department store offerings, the regime and the elite are successfully finding loopholes.” The draft of the U.N. report says North Korea conducted 13 missile tests and launched 25 missiles in 2019.

In the draft of its new report, the U.N. panel lists the vehicle identification numbers of the two armored Mercedes sedans shipped to North Korea in the summer of 2018. The numbers allowed investigators to ferret out additional details on the shipment and the companies involved.The report names two Italian companies as procurers, but did not accuse them of illegal activity.Mr. Cianci, a sales manager for European Cars and More SRL, the Italian company that bought the cars from Mercedes-Benz in early 2018, said in lengthy interviews that he had not violated any export regulations and expressed frustration that Mercedes-Benz had cut business ties with him in December 2019.He did not provide the name of the client for whom he bought the cars. “My client is Italian. He has an import-export business in Rome,” Mr. Cianci said. “The client is someone with not only diplomatic connections to China, but also other countries.”The second Italian company named in the report is LS Logistica e Spedizioni SRL, based in Rome. It was responsible for shipping the cars to Dalian, China, and then onward to Japan. The company did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, was not able to provide additional details on the specific cars, but released a statement that said the “sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility.”“For many years, we have only received photos of cars, which gave us no possibility to identify any of the vehicles. Only in 2019, we received VIN numbers of vehicles mentioned in the C4ADS report from a journalist of an Asian television network,” the statement continued, using the abbreviation for the Center for Advanced Defense Studies. “We then proactively approached the U.N. and connected the journalists directly with the authority to make sure that the information could be subject matter of investigations.” In the draft of its new report, the U.N. panel lists the vehicle identification numbers of the two armored Mercedes sedans shipped to North Korea in the summer of 2018. The numbers allowed investigators to ferret out additional details on the shipment and the companies involved.The report names two Italian companies as procurers, but did not accuse them of illegal activity.Mr. Cianci, a sales manager for European Cars and More SRL, the Italian company that bought the cars from Mercedes-Benz in early 2018, said in lengthy interviews that he had not violated any export regulations and expressed frustration that Mercedes-Benz had cut business ties with him in December 2019.He did not provide the name of the client for whom he bought the cars. “My client is Italian. He has an import-export business in Rome,” Mr. Cianci said. “The client is someone with not only diplomatic connections to China, but also other countries.”The second Italian company named in the report is LS Logistica e Spedizioni SRL, based in Rome. It was responsible for shipping the cars to Dalian, China, and then onward to Japan.

North Korea is raising millions of dollars through the smuggling of commodities, the U.N. report says.Last October, Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, a member of the United Nations Panel of Experts from 2014 to 2019, wrote on the 38 North website that the “maximum pressure” campaign on North Korea was “on its last legs.”“The Trump administration bears special responsibility for this situation,” she wrote. “It has been its own worst enemy in the maximum-pressure campaign.”She asserted that Mr. Trump “remains unwilling to admit fault or failure for the lack of progress on denuclearization or to change the U.S. approach to negotiations with the North.”North Korea has been creative in its sources of revenue. Both the upcoming U.N. report and a separate post this month by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies noted an increase in sand-dredging activity by North Korean ships in 2019. A center of the operation was in Haeju Bay, North Korea, from March to August. Chinese companies are the main buyer of the sand, an important material in construction projects and in making silicon chips. The holes in sanctions go well beyond the importing of luxury goods.

"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether judges must determine that juvenile offenders are incorrigible before sentencing them to die in prison.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump has spent the past several weeks dismissing concerns about any economic effects from the coronavirus and insisting that American companies and consumers are in no danger.On Monday, after stock markets suffered their worst single-day decline in more than a decade, Treasury yields reached new lows and oil prices plummeted, Mr. Trump said he was ready to act.The president said the White House would unveil “very dramatic” proposals to help protect the American economy from the coronavirus, including financial help for workers who don’t get paid sick leave, tax cuts and targeted relief for industries battered by the virus, including cruise lines, airlines and hotels.The overture sets up tense negotiations with Congress, just weeks after the president was impeached by House Democrats and less than a year from Election Day. Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump’s efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president’s handling of the crisis.

Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump’s efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president’s handling of the crisis. Democrats have expressed openness to certain measures of stimulus — like paid sick leave and increased spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps — that could provide the building blocks for a deal with the president. And Mr. Trump’s efforts could be aided by the fact that federal borrowing costs have fallen to rock-bottom rates as skittish investors in recent days have piled into safe U.S. government debt.Mr. Trump’s decision to seek fiscal help amounts to concession by a White House that has ignored increasingly ominous predictions of the virus’s economic effects, which have ranged from dramatically slowing growth in the United States to plunging the economy into recession.That threat was compounded over the weekend by Saudi Arabia’s announcement that it would ramp up oil production, sending prices into a downward spiral and raising the threat of layoffs and shelved investments in the American oil industry.Mr. Trump and his aides had played down the economic threats as recently as Monday morning, when the president celebrated falling gas prices as “good for the consumer” while blaming the stock plunge on a combination of Saudi Arabia, Russia and “fake news.” He also suggested fears about the virus were overblown, saying more people have died from the flu than the new coronavirus. “Life & the economy go on,” he tweeted.

Investors are worried about economic fallout from an epidemic that is threatening to slow growth and eat into corporate profits by shuttering factories, forcing quarantines, curtailing travel and scrapping big events.Stocks are plummeting, along with Treasury yields, and many economists and investors are beginning to express concern that financial vulnerabilities could exacerbate what is already poised to become an economic mess.Banks are on more solid footing than they were ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, with higher capital and less ability to make risky bets with their own balance sheets than in the heady days of the mid-2000s housing bubble.

But warning signs abound. Credit markets are beginning to show signs of strain, investors are fleeing indexes that track risky bonds, and some economists are questioning whether the coronavirus could spark a corporate debt crisis. “If the virus triggers a sharper drop in profits or a bigger rise in borrowing costs than we envisage, then these pockets of vulnerability could blow up,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note last week. “Although the global banking system appears to be better placed to deal with such turbulence now than at the time of the global financial crisis, at the very least this could exacerbate any virus-related global downturn.”The White House has invited top Wall Street executives to a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout, according to an official.As recently as January, Federal Reserve officials expressed worry that “financial imbalances — including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness — could amplify an adverse shock to the economy.”Corporate debt has skyrocketed over the past decade, and more than half of investment-grade company debt is just one notch above a “junk” rating, with BBB debt in the United States now totaling more than $3 trillion. Such bonds are vulnerable to status downgrades in tough times — Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners estimates that as much as $1 trillion of investment-grade debt could soon head to junk.That is of particular concern because mutual funds are holding big chunks of BBB debt. Funds could be forced to dump those holdings quickly in the face of downgrades because many are not allowed to invest in junk bonds. “If the virus triggers a sharper drop in profits or a bigger rise in borrowing costs than we envisage, then these pockets of vulnerability could blow up,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note last week. “Although the global banking system appears to be better placed to deal with such turbulence now than at the time of the global financial crisis, at the very least this could exacerbate any virus-related global downturn.”The White House has invited top Wall Street executives to a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout, according to an official.As recently as January, Federal Reserve officials expressed worry that “financial imbalances — including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness — could amplify an adverse shock to the economy.”Corporate debt has skyrocketed over the past decade, and more than half of investment-grade company debt is just one notch above a “junk” rating, with BBB debt in the United States now totaling more than $3 trillion.

That could make it harder for households and businesses — bank customers — to pay back their own debt, and “banks could incur losses.” And the financial crisis was painful, in part, because banks stopped lending, leaving consumers without access to cash. They could do that fairly abruptly in 2020 in part because of a new accounting standard, called current expected credit losses methodology.The rule took hold for big banks this year, and forces them to value loans over their lifetime — a measure meant to more accurately gauge risk, but one that could also make projected losses look more drastic when the economy is worsening. The change is expected to dissuade lenders from extending new mortgages and lines of credit during times of stress.“To avoid huge accounting losses, which cut into capital, the effect would be to not lend, or to lend less,” said Joshua Ronen, an accounting professor at New York University. That could “paradoxically” hit the most strapped borrowers, he said, since they are often the worst credit risk.Strains to the financial system could come at a particularly bad time. Big financial firms outside the banking sector remain largely out of regulatory oversight, including asset managers, hedge funds, private equity firms and big insurers.And the rules governing regulated institutions have become gradually less stringent. The Fed made a regulatory change last week, which one official — the Fed governor Lael Brainard, an Obama administration pick — warned could significantly reduce capital at the biggest banks.Fed officials had already expressed concern in January that banks might be returning too much of their profits to shareholders, leaving them exposed if there is another big downturn. “Planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in capital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks,” according to minutes of the meeting.Banking regulators have also been working to relax the Volcker Rule, which prohibited banks from making risky bets with their customers’ deposits. Banks took major losses on their derivatives holdings in the 2008 crisis, helping to exacerbate financial system strains. Proposed changes would allow banks to invest in some credit funds and sponsor or take ownership stakes in venture capital funds, which pool ultrarich investors’ money to bet on start-ups.

Under the Obama administration, the council determined that four large non-bank companies, including American International Group, were “systemically important,” meaning those firms would be subject to Fed oversight.Under Mr. Mnuchin’s leadership, the council has released those firms from federal oversight and abandoned efforts to designate any other firm as “systemic.” It has opted instead to assess whether any financial “activities” pose risks to the system. None have been identified.And the Office of Financial Research, an independent agency created in 2010 to serve as an early warning system for emerging risks, has been gutted and marginalized over the past three years, with Mr. Mnuchin recommending that the agency become a “functional part of Treasury,” with its director chosen by the Treasury secretary rather than the president. “We are in a much more fragile situation than we should be because the regulators haven’t been on the job,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform. “This is a real economic crisis we’re facing.”Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, warned in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week that the country faced a potential “economic calamity.” He called on Mr. Mnuchin to work with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which he chairs, to come up with a plan.“I am concerned that you and your fellow regulators on the council have repeatedly failed to take action to make the financial system more resilient, putting our economy at risk as we experience the first period of financial stress under your watch,” Mr. Brown wrote.Mr. Mnuchin has been criticized for weakening safeguards put in place to prevent a repeat of 2008, when regulators were largely caught off guard by the severity of losses at financial firms, including those outside the banking sector.Congress created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify risks to the financial system and respond to emerging threats.

How they navigate their differences to try to unite the competing factions will go a long way toward determining whether Democrats assemble a coalition powerful enough to dethrone President Trump in the fall.The race has already been upended by the crisis surrounding the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced both candidates to curtail appearances before big crowds and to plan for a debate on Sunday without a live audience. The Biden campaign announced Wednesday it was canceling two upcoming events in Illinois and Florida. Mr. Sanders has yet to officially announce any public events, but his campaign is planning virtual events such as tele-town halls and live-streamed addresses.Mr. Sanders did not consider dropping out after Tuesday’s losses, according to people familiar with his thinking, but he was stunned by how severe they were and now recognizes he needs to reassess his path forward. Mr. Biden scored victories in four states, including Michigan, where Mr. Sanders had counted on a victory to revive his candidacy.In recent days, Mr. Sanders has told people that the campaign is running out of time to recapture its momentum or maintain sufficient leverage to demand the kinds of sweeping progressive policy concessions from Mr. Biden he outlined on Wednesday.

Nine times during his remarks, Mr. Sanders cited an issue central to his progressive agenda and asked Mr. Biden, “What are you going to do?” — listing systemic problems related to topics like health care and income inequality. Mr. Sanders is also still fighting to win, some of his aides said, insisting there were more opportunities to accumulate delegates in states like Oregon and Wisconsin, which would require Mr. Sanders to stay in the race into late April and May.But one longtime Sanders confidant, Larry Cohen, also acknowledged the challenges ahead in states like Florida and Ohio, which vote next week, and the daunting coalition of white and African-American voters Mr. Biden has put together. Mr. Cohen, the chairman of Our Revolution, the Sanders-aligned political organization, said the goal was now as much about accruing delegates to use as leverage in negotiations with Mr. Biden as it was an effort to win the nomination.“Every delegate is critical to our agenda and discussions with Joe Biden,” Mr. Cohen said from Florida, where he met Wednesday with Our Revolution members who are seeking delegate slots at the Democratic National Convention to help Mr. Sanders. Of Mr. Sanders’s supporters, Mr. Cohen said, “Their only voice is to be elected delegate.”Mr. Sanders now finds himself in an awkward position, pressing on despite long odds even as he insists he wants above all for a Democrat to beat Mr. Trump in November. For months, he has been reluctant to attack Mr. Biden directly, which resulted in inconsistent messaging: At times, he and his campaign would attack Mr. Biden, only to pull back and return to his central policy message of transformational change.After Super Tuesday and into this week, some allies expressed frustration, anxious that even if Mr. Sanders were to mount a comeback, it would be too late. On Tuesday night, his most prominent surrogate, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, told viewers on her Instagram live stream that the election results were a setback for the progressive movement.

Mr. Sanders has also made it clear that he is aware he cannot continue to campaign indefinitely and defiantly, as he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to former aides and people currently in his orbit.And for all of the criticism he has leveled at Mr. Biden recently, Mr. Sanders feels far more positively in a personal way toward Mr. Biden than he did toward Mrs. Clinton, which could make a reconciliation less contentious, according to a veteran of the last campaign. This person and others briefed on Mr. Sanders’s campaign plans insisted on anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.Over the past several months, Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, has opened up a line of communication with one of Mr. Biden’s top political aides, Anita Dunn. Although the back-channel setup has mostly been used to arrange logistics — they hashed out an agreement this week to bar a live audience from Sunday’s debate — it is likely to be the main conduit for talks about political matters, according to people on both campaigns.With over half the delegates still to be allocated, aides to Mr. Sanders said they saw more fertile terrain in the coming weeks. They point out that Mr. Sanders narrowly lost Illinois four years ago and see strength in Wisconsin and Puerto Rico. Georgia, with its heavily black electorate, will most likely go to Mr. Biden, who currently leads Mr. Sanders in delegates, 864 to 710, with delegates still to be counted.Mr. Sanders also has about $9 million worth of ads booked through March 17, including a $2 million buy this week.Aides say Mr. Sanders is particularly motivated to participate in the debate on Sunday in Phoenix because he views it as his first and possibly last opportunity to face Mr. Biden one on one and hold him accountable for his record, while trumpeting his own record in contrast.“Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,” Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday. “On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.” Mr. Sanders has also made it clear that he is aware he cannot continue to campaign indefinitely and defiantly, as he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to former aides and people currently in his orbit.And for all of the criticism he has leveled at Mr. Biden recently, Mr. Sanders feels far more positively in a personal way toward Mr. Biden than he did toward Mrs. Clinton, which could make a reconciliation less contentious, according to a veteran of the last campaign.

Georgia, with its heavily black electorate, will most likely go to Mr. Biden, who currently leads Mr. Sanders in delegates, 864 to 710, with delegates still to be counted.Mr. Sanders also has about $9 million worth of ads booked through March 17, including a $2 million buy this week.Aides say Mr. Sanders is particularly motivated to participate in the debate on Sunday in Phoenix because he views it as his first and possibly last opportunity to face Mr. Biden one on one and hold him accountable for his record, while trumpeting his own record in contrast.“Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,” Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday. “On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.” But the rest of his path forward is murky, especially as concerns about the coronavirus threaten to upend a signature facet of his campaign: Mr. Sanders’s enormous rallies, where the enthusiasm and passion of his loyal base are on vivid display. It is unclear how he will marshal the energy he boasts about from behind a computer screen or over a telephone line.In his address Wednesday, Mr. Sanders spoke soberly about the signals voters had sent about Mr. Biden being more electable.“I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said — and I quote — ‘I like what your campaign stands for. I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I’m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,’” he said.“Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion, but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.”Mr. Sanders watched the results come in on Tuesday night at his home with his wife, Jane, while aides gathered elsewhere. He did not make any public comments then.On Wednesday at his news conference, Mr. Sanders was cleareyed about the challenges ahead but also resolute about his strengths.“Last night obviously was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,” Mr. Sanders said, as his wife looked on. But he asserted that he was “winning the generational debate,” saying that while Mr. Biden was appealing to older voters, he was drawing younger Americans, and that the party needed to build around the leaders of the future.

But Mr. Sanders’s highest-profile surrogate, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, said she understood Ms. Warren’s hesitation, and suggested it was a teachable moment for the left.“I always want to see us come together as a progressive wing,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think that’s important and where we draw strength from. But at the same time, I come from the lens of an organizer, and if someone doesn’t do what you want, you don’t blame them — you ask why. And you don’t demand that answer of that person — you reflect. And that reflection is where you can grow.”The lopsided results on Tuesday, when Mr. Sanders lost every county in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi, further hardened Ms. Warren’s decision, according to a person close to the Massachusetts senator.

Those close to Ms. Warren say her foremost reason for not endorsing Mr. Sanders is simple: Since her exit from the race, his path to victory has looked unlikely. They doubt that Ms. Warren, even as the most prominent former candidate to have not backed another primary contender so far, could reverse Mr. Sanders’s fortunes at this point, and fear that she risks squandering valuable political capital if she tries to do so and fails.It was also not clear what difference Ms. Warren might have made in addressing Mr. Sanders’s glaring vulnerability with black voters, with whom Ms. Warren had shown little sway herself.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who endorsed Ms. Warren in her personal capacity, was among those who spoke with Ms. Warren after Super Tuesday.“It made tremendous sense for her to stay on the sidelines so she could play the role of unifier,” said Ms. Weingarten, who declined to discuss her private conversation with Ms. Warren.Brian Fallon, who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is now a progressive strategist, was doubtful that Ms. Warren’s backing would have significantly helped Mr. Sanders and said it might not have “sat well with the coalition she ended the race with,” which was dominated by college-educated white women.“Why would she want to make her endorsement seem less powerful by giving it to somebody on a downward trajectory?” Mr. Fallon asked.Four years ago, Ms. Warren stayed neutral in the Democratic primary between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, and during the general election she used her influence among liberals to push Mrs. Clinton to make more left-leaning personnel choices in her transition team. “That was the template that she designed in 2016,” Mr. Fallon said. “Wait back, hold until the nomination is settled and then be very practical and hard-boiled about what your asks are.” Those close to Ms. Warren say her foremost reason for not endorsing Mr. Sanders is simple: Since her exit from the race, his path to victory has looked unlikely.

In a prime-time address to the nation Wednesday night, Mr. Trump embraced some of the ideas Democrats have proposed. He called on Congress to provide emergency help for those who must stay home because they are ill, quarantined or caring for others, and asked for $50 billion for low-interest loans to help small businesses overcome the economic disruption wrought by the virus.“This is not a financial crisis. This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world,” the president said, though he added that his administration would “provide extra support for American workers, families and businesses.”But Mr. Trump also called on Congress to “provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief” — an idea that has fallen flat on Capitol Hill, where members of both parties have expressed opposition to the president’s proposal to suspend the tax entirely through the end of the year, a measure whose cost is estimated at $800 billion or more. Democrats reacted coolly.“We have a public health crisis in this country and the best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,” Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said in their statement. “Alarmingly, the president did not say how the administration will address the lack of coronavirus testing kits throughout the United States.”Earlier in the day, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, told lawmakers that proposal and other broad measures to stimulate the economy that might take longer to agree upon could be part of a second request the administration sends Congress later.

Ms. Pelosi held a meeting with her caucus on Wednesday to discuss her proposal. Earlier in the day, top House Democrats were briefed by Jason Furman, an economist who advised President Barack Obama, on how to proceed.Congress already approved an $8.3 billion emergency aid package — more than three times what Mr. Trump requested — to send additional funding to the federal health agencies responding to the coronavirus. The president signed that measure last week. After weeks of playing down the potential effects of the virus, Mr. Trump is now calling for drastic economic measures, including the payroll tax suspension, whose cost would rival  the Wall Street bailout of 2008 and the economic stimulus measure that followed.

Senate Democrats released a plan on Wednesday that includes a six-month break for borrowers on paying federal student loans and mortgages; block grants to help communities where the virus has shut down the economy; direct grants to small businesses; assistance to help public transit systems stay in operation; rental and mortgage payment assistance for some borrowers; and grants to child care centers and schools that are infected with the virus.“We are just appalled at the administration,” said Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York. “We don’t think they should just throw money out of an airplane and hope that some of it lands on the people” who need assistance, he added.

The ravages of the coronavirus and the market meltdown this week, like the ravages of that storm 15 years ago, played out on the screens for hours — urgently, relentlessly, inexorably, inescapably.Then and now, there was a palpable sense of a besieged leader confronting a whole new reality, that the world had suddenly changed and so had his presidency. Seen fairly or not as out of touch so high in the sky, Mr. Trump like Mr. Bush before him landed and headed to the White House to take on a challenge he had not fully recognized at first. In each case, the president then headed to the cameras to reassure a country that was not at all convinced.In Mr. Trump’s case, he addressed the health situation primarily in economic terms, clearly rattled by the largest market drop in more than a decade, as he vowed measures like a payroll tax cut and aid for low-wage workers sidelined because of the virus. “We have a great economy, we have a very strong economy, but this came — this blindsided the world,” he said, including, he acknowledged, himself. “And I think we’ve handled it very, very well.” WASHINGTON — Riding Air Force One with President Trump back to the nation’s capital on Monday afternoon felt eerily like that grim day in 2005 when President George W.

When an American died in early 1976 from what some feared was a new strain of the Spanish flu, Gerald R.

About 450 cases of the paralyzing Guillain-Barré syndrome were attributed to the vaccine.

But he learned from it. When the economy crashed in 2008, Mr. Bush was slow to recognize the extent of the threat at first. But once he did, he responded with overwhelming force.Casting aside his own ideological convictions, he embraced an unprecedented bailout program to keep the banking industry from collapse and pushed it through Congress over the resistance of his fellow Republicans. Recognizing that his own credibility was damaged, he put forth someone he thought the public and lawmakers would trust more, Treasury Secretary Henry M.

He also appeared to minimize the damage the virus has already wreaked across the country, where there are now more than 1,200 active cases. Instead, he heaped praise on his administration’s response when in reality, his attempts to play down the health crisis have been under fierce criticism for weeks.There were also surprising — and significant — inaccuracies in the speech, which administration officials and the president had to clarify almost immediately afterward. Mr. Trump said in his address he would suspend “all travel from Europe to the United States,” but the ban in fact applies to foreign citizens. And while he said the measure would “apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo” across the ocean, the order in fact affects only people.Throughout his 10-minute, uncharacteristically formal address, Mr. Trump struggled to find a middle ground between acknowledging the deepening crisis and diminishing its threat to the country’s future.“This is not a financial crisis,” he said. “This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world.” He also appeared to minimize the damage the virus has already wreaked across the country, where there are now more than 1,200 active cases.

But his measured tone belied the frustration Mr. Trump has been venting behind closed doors in recent days over the spread of the coronavirus, the tumbling financial markets it has caused and the blame he has directed at Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, for not making more moves to reduce the economic effect.Despite handing over the coronavirus portfolio to Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Trump has been unable to let it go as he has watched the stock market plunge and the economy he has pinned his re-election hopes on suddenly falter. But it was Mr. Pence who played the biggest role in moving Mr. Trump to give a more forceful public statement, over many days, according to White House officials.

Until Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic had been defined mostly by his own wishful thinking that projecting a “business as usual” approach would calm nerves and reassure the stock market.But the day’s events convinced Mr. Trump that it was time for a response, prompting the president to upend his schedule, which included a private dinner at the residence or Mr. Pence, who also canceled a scheduled news briefing with the coronavirus task force to allow Mr. Trump to deliver the administration’s message of the day.After Mr. Trump’s speech, Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary, also announced the cancellation of the president’s planned trip this week to Colorado and Las Vegas, citing “an abundance of caution from the coronavirus outbreak.” But his measured tone belied the frustration Mr. Trump has been venting behind closed doors in recent days over the spread of the coronavirus, the tumbling financial markets it has caused and the blame he has directed at Jerome H.

His appearance there was only scrapped late Wednesday night and organizers earlier in the day said they had been told Mr. Trump planned to attend.

His appearance there was only scrapped late Wednesday night and organizers earlier in the day said they had been told Mr. Trump planned to attend. Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump also had to be persuaded by several advisers to hold off on announcing a campaign rally in Florida that was scheduled for the end of March.“It will go away, just stay calm,” the president said Tuesday after meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill, even as officials on his own coronavirus task force had publicly contradicted his “nothing to see here” message in a way that has rarely been seen before in the administration.Mr. Trump’s first public response to the health crisis was on Jan. 31, when the administration announced it would bar entry by most foreign citizens who had recently visited China, and put some American travelers under a quarantine as it declared a rare public health emergency.The move was considered a significant step at the time, and Mr. Trump was lauded by Republicans for taking what some described as an unprecedented action to contain the spread of the virus.

But officials have since conceded that those efforts at containment have not prevented the virus from spreading within communities around the United States.And as that spread has increased, Mr. Trump’s administration has been criticized for a decision to dismantle a branch of the National Security Council devoted exclusively to global pandemics, and for a shortage of coronavirus test kits that until this week made it impossible to identify anyone who was infected.

For his part, Mr. Trump has continually made false statements and misinformed the public about the severity of a virus that has left at least 37 people in the United States dead. Instead, his focus has been on repeating how well he thinks the response has gone rather than focusing on the response itself.Speaking last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where many lawmakers were exposed to an attendee infected with the virus, Mr. Trump said that his administration’s response “has been now given very good grades, like an A +++.Mr. Trump has claimed, falsely, that the number of cases in the United States would go down to “close to zero.” He has been fact-checked in real time by members of his own coronavirus task force, for stating falsely that a vaccine would be available “relatively soon.”And in his address Wednesday night, Mr. Trump repeated another theme — that he viewed the virus as something that was inflicted upon him from a foreign country. He wanted to discuss “our nation’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world,” he said.

Over the past month, Mr. Trump has been grasping at strands of good news in his briefings. In February, for instance, he repeated something he picked up in one: that viruses do not spread as fast in warmer temperatures.“A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat,” Mr. Trump told Fox News last month. In reality, however, it is not clear how coronavirus will change with the weather. And Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told members of Congress on Wednesday that when it came to the virus, “we have got to assume it is going to get worse and worse and worse.”Behind the scenes, Mr. Kushner has taken an increasingly active role in the coronavirus response, and spent the day with the president on Wednesday.But he has also been among a small group of White House advisers who have reinforced Mr. Trump’s belief that the news media is exaggerating the threat of the virus in an effort to damage the president, according to people familiar with the conversations in the West Wing.Republicans who have clashed with the White House said they remained skeptical about what the president could accomplish, even as he claimed on Twitter that he was “prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government” to confront the challenge posed by coronavirus.“For the foreseeable future, people are going to be looking for steady leadership and effective management, neither of which are his calling card,” said Brendan Buck, a former aide to Speaker Paul D. Ryan. “We don’t know how long this will last or how bad it will be.”Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

"My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nation’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic.We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.  I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats.  This is the way it always was and always will be.  It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.

This is the way it always was and always will be.  It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world.  At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years.  We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection. And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots.  As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well being of all Americans.To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.  The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.  These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. Our team is the best anywhere in the world.

Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.  These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.

The elderly population must be very, very careful.In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits.  In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas.  My administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing and reducing large gatherings.Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts — and they are the best. For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene.  Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus.  Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief.  This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong.  Our unemployment is at a historic low.  This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.

However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions:  I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus. Effective immediately, the S.B.A. will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories.  These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus.  To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted.  This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.  Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus.  We made a lifesaving move with early action on China.  Now we must take the same action with Europe.  We will not delay.  I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people.  I will always put the well being of America first.If we are vigilant — and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will — we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus.  The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.  We have the best economy, the most advanced health care, and the most talented doctors, scientists and researchers anywhere in the world. However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions:  I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus. Effective immediately, the S.B.A. will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories.  These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus.  To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted.  This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.  Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus.  We made a lifesaving move with early action on China.  Now we must take the same action with Europe.  We will not delay.  I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people.  I will always put the well being of America first.If we are vigilant — and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will — we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus.  The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.  We have the best economy, the most advanced health care, and the most talented doctors, scientists and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this together.  We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family. As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity. Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine.  Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.God bless you, and God bless America.  Thank you. We are all in this together.  We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family.

"WASHINGTON — A Republican Senate committee chairman abruptly called off a subpoena vote on Wednesday after federal authorities shared concerns that a former Ukrainian official cooperating with Republican investigators could be spreading Russian disinformation.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, was under pressure from Democrats and members of his own party after a pair of briefings from federal officials on Tuesday. The briefings raised questions about the Ukrainian’s reliability as a source for two politically sensitive investigations before the committee, including one into the family of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Johnson told lawmakers Wednesday afternoon he would delay his pursuit of additional documents from the former Ukrainian official, Andrii Telizhenko, until intelligence officials could provide more information to lawmakers.In a letter to fellow lawmakers Wednesday afternoon just before the scheduled vote, Mr. Johnson told his colleagues he was postponing the vote “out of an abundance of caution, and to allow time for you to receive additional briefings.” WASHINGTON — A Republican Senate committee chairman abruptly called off a subpoena vote on Wednesday after federal authorities shared concerns that a former Ukrainian official cooperating with Republican investigators could be spreading Russian disinformation.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, was under pressure from Democrats and members of his own party after a pair of briefings from federal officials on Tuesday.

But, he said, “I did not think there was any kind of big deal,” and noted that the subpoena merely sought correspondence from Mr. Telizhenko related to his work for Blue Star, which could be vetted for authenticity by the company and the United States intelligence community.

I guess you can interview choir boys, but in general, if you really want to find out what’s happening in a drug cartel, you might be dealing with people that you might question their veracity, which is what we do,” Mr. Johnson said. “When it comes to dealing with anybody in Ukraine, I take what they tell me with a grain of salt, and we proceed with real caution. And I think that really is, in the end, what the F.B.I.’s brief was all about was, just be careful, which we are.” “Let’s say you’re investigating drug cartels.

And I think that really is, in the end, what the F.B.I.’s brief was all about was, just be careful, which we are.” While Mr. Johnson said that Blue Star has “not been cooperative,” Karen A. Tramontano, a partner at the firm, said it has provided the committee “with nearly 89 pages of relevant documents,” responded to questions from several committees and “will continue to cooperate with the committees’ investigation to the best of our ability.”Staff members for the committee have been working with Mr. Telizhenko for months, interviewing him and collecting documents to bolster two separate investigations into subjects that could help President Trump as he heads into a re-election campaign in which Mr. Biden has emerged as his leading Democratic challenger. The White House is closely monitoring Mr. Johnson’s efforts on the investigations, according to a person familiar with the situation.One of the investigations deals with the overlap between Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company widely accused of corruption, and his father’s diplomacy in Ukraine. The other relates to claims that Ukrainian officials tried to undermine Mr. Trump during his 2016 campaign.Both subjects featured prominently in last year’s impeachment of Mr. Trump, who had urged the Ukrainians to investigate the matters.Mr. Telizhenko has firsthand experience in both subjects. Before his work with Blue Star on behalf of Burisma, he worked for Ukraine’s top prosecutor and then in Ukraine’s Embassy in Washington, where, he claims, he was instructed by a superior to work with a Democratic operative to collect and disseminate damaging information about Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Republicans seized on those claims to justify Mr. Trump’s push for investigations and, at times, to answer concerns about Russia’s interference to help Mr. Trump in 2016.American intelligence agencies have concerns about Mr. Telizhenko’s role in spreading disinformation about Ukraine’s involvement in the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the matter.Intelligence agencies have contended for months that Russian intelligence has worked to amplify, spread and distort stories relating to the involvement of Ukrainian officials in trying to influence the outcome of the last presidential election, as part of a campaign to minimize or obscure Moscow’s own efforts.

Mr. Telizhenko, 29, was raised partly in Canada, attended the University of the District of Columbia and speaks fluent English. During the 2014 uprising that ousted Ukraine’s Russia-aligned president, Mr. Telizhenko helped the protesters connect with Western politicians including Senator John McCain, whose funeral he attended in 2018.Mr. Telizhenko says he is a political conservative and has been hanging out at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, appearing on the conservative One America News Network and forging a bond with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose efforts to uncover politically useful information have been assisted by Mr. Telizhenko.

Mr. Telizhenko, who has been a private consultant since leaving his role with the embassy in 2016, declined to identify his clients. But someone familiar with his work said that he had until recently represented a pair of wealthy businessmen in the former Soviet Union who have intermittently embraced and distanced themselves from Russia — the Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky and the Ukrainian-Russian developer Pavel Fuks.Mr. Telizhenko dismissed suggestions that his efforts to assist with the politically charged investigations were on behalf of any client or foreign power. Noting that he first publicly aired his claims about the Ukrainian Embassy in early January 2017, he said in an interview on Wednesday, “How can I control what is picked up by the Russians or anybody else?”He said he was merely trying to salvage his reputation against Democratic efforts to discredit him and to protect Mr. Biden and others in the party.“When people in the Democratic Party and in Blue Star’s office started to try to destroy my reputation by calling me a Russian spy,” he said, “I had no choice but to go to the proper authorities in the United States to investigate my information and to clear my name.” Mr. Telizhenko, who has been a private consultant since leaving his role with the embassy in 2016, declined to identify his clients.

And Mr. Telizhenko had told staff members for Mr. Johnson’s committee that he had shared some of the same information he provided them with the F.B.I. as a source, according to someone familiar with the conversations.But late last month, when Mr. Telizhenko arrived in New York, partly to meet with Mr. Giuliani, he said he was questioned for hours by detectives from Customs and Border Protection, who searched his phone and asked him whether he was working with Russian or Ukrainian intelligence.In the run-up to the proposed subpoena vote, the F.B.I. briefed staff members for Mr. Johnson and Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, the committee’s top Democrat, in a classified setting Tuesday morning to specifically discuss Mr. Telizhenko, according to two officials familiar with the briefings who were not authorized to discuss classified information.The F.B.I.’s message in the briefing contradicted information it had shared during an earlier, unclassified phone call with committee staff, according to the officials and to Mr. Johnson. “There was a discrepancy,” Mr. Johnson said. “The situation got a little muddied yesterday, so we’re going to have to kind of work our way through that.”The topic of Mr. Telizhenko and Russian disinformation also came up during a classified election security briefing open to all senators on Tuesday, the officials said. Members of the Homeland Security Committee huddled afterward to discuss how to proceed, and lawmakers from both parties expressed discomfort with approving a subpoena without more information from the intelligence community, the people said.Among them was Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who had only grudgingly agreed to support the subpoena in the first place for what he considered a politically motivated inquiry.

The chairman insists his interest has nothing to do with politics, but Mr. Trump has made no secret of the fact that he hopes to use the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine as a major theme of his campaign.Julian E.

In the case of Fox News viewers and talk radio listeners, who tend to be older than the general population, the danger of playing down the threat is potentially far worse. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has specifically identified older people as being at higher risk from serious complications if they contract the virus. The typical Fox News viewer is in his or her mid-60s, similar to CNN and MSNBC.Despite Mr. Hannity’s own skeptical commentary, his Tuesday show featured Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as a guest. He told Mr. Hannity that he wanted to “make sure” viewers knew that the coronavirus “is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu — you got to make sure that people understand that.”It was not difficult to see why Dr. Fauci would think Mr. Hannity’s roughly four million viewers — the biggest audience in cable news — might not understand. On Tuesday, the star anchor told his viewers, effectively, to relax.“Sadly, these viruses pop up time to time,” Mr. Hannity said, with the certitude of a medical professional. “Pandemics happen, time to time.”Mr. Limbaugh has offered clinical advice. Recently he defended his widely criticized comparison of the coronavirus to the common cold and suggested the timing of the coverage of the outbreak raised “a gigantic series of question marks and red flags.”And not all the prominent players in conservative opinion are denying the seriousness of the threat. Disagreement on the right has spilled into public view in a way that is unusual, given how swiftly dissent is often punished by Mr. Trump and his media loyalists. “That’s not just a problem for the right wing, that becomes a real threat to the general population,” added Mr. Sykes, who is also a contributor to MSNBC. “When people start dying, the entertainment value wears off.”

Disagreement on the right has spilled into public view in a way that is unusual, given how swiftly dissent is often punished by Mr. Trump and his media loyalists. “It’s a matter of public health. How can these shills face their followers after all the lies and deceit?” asked Michael Savage, the radio host and author who was one of Mr. Trump’s earliest supporters in conservative media and urged him to run for president in 2011.“Are these mouthpieces without any social conscience?” added Mr. Savage, who called the words of Mr. Limbaugh and others “criminal negligence.”Speaking on his Monday Fox News show, Tucker Carlson seemed to speak directly to skeptics like the president and Mr. Hannity, whose prime-time program follows his. “People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem,” Mr. Carlson said, adding: “People you know will get sick, some may die.

How can these shills face their followers after all the lies and deceit?” asked Michael Savage, the radio host and author who was one of Mr. Trump’s earliest supporters in conservative media and urged him to run for president in 2011.“Are these mouthpieces without any social conscience?” added Mr. Savage, who called the words of Mr. Limbaugh and others “criminal negligence.”Speaking on his Monday Fox News show, Tucker Carlson seemed to speak directly to skeptics like the president and Mr. Hannity, whose prime-time program follows his. “People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem,” Mr. Carlson said, adding: “People you know will get sick, some may die.

And Americans who approve of the way the president is handling his job are far more likely to believe that the government can stop a nationwide epidemic from occurring than those who disapprove, the poll said. Seventy-nine percent of those who gave Mr. Trump high job approval ratings said they were very or somewhat confident in the government’s ability to prevent the outbreak from becoming much worse, compared with only 39 percent of those who disapprove of him, according to a CNN poll conducted last week.At times, there has been a jarring split screen between the president’s nonchalance and the sober warnings of the nation’s top health officials, who have been more aggressive about warning certain vulnerable populations not to travel.Asked on Wednesday at the White House what he had to say to those concerned he is not taking the situation seriously enough, Mr. Trump offered a tart, terse reply: “Fake news,” the president snapped, before dismissing reporters from the room.The fallout from the president’s handling of the crisis might have been more easily dismissed as liberal, anti-Trump paranoia if not for an improbable twist of events. A person infected with the coronavirus attended one of the conservative world’s biggest annual gatherings last week, the Conservative Political Action Conference, leading some politicians like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to voluntarily quarantine themselves.Before this person’s status was made public — he was a V.I.P. attendee who purchased a $5,750 “gold” package that granted him access to backstage reception rooms where members of Congress and other high-profile figures mingled — conservatives at the conference were accusing the president’s enemies of inflating the seriousness of the outbreak.The former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, speaking from the conference stage last Friday, insisted falsely that the media had only just started paying attention to the coronavirus after the impeachment trial ended. And the reason, he added, was “they think this is going to be what brings down the president.”But over the next few days, CPAC’s organizers were pelted with questions from fellow conservatives, some of whom said they shook the infected guest’s hand, about why they had been left in the dark.

Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “Even if the U.S. took a leadership role, the traditional playbook would not be all that relevant here.”Britain, for example, won praise for its robust economic response, which, in addition to billions of pounds for hospitals and workers sidelined by illness, included a sharp interest rate cut by the Bank of England. “The nature of this crisis is qualitatively different than the one in 2008 because the traditional tools are not as effective,” said Richard N.

He said countries needed to put their energy into slowing and mitigating the spread of the virus before they embarked on fiscal programs to repair the economic damage.The trouble is that, with few exceptions, their efforts have been hapless. In the United States, the delay in developing coronavirus test kits and the scarcity of tests have made it impossible for officials, even weeks after the first cases appeared in the country, to get a true picture of the scale of the outbreak.In hard-hit Italy, quarrels broke out between politicians and medical experts over whether the authorities were testing too many people in Lombardy, inflating the infection figures and fueling panic in the public. Italy’s response could be weakened further by the anti-vaccination movement that was once embraced by the populist Five Star Movement, which took power in the last government.

Even comparing one country’s case count with another’s is almost impossible, given the different testing procedures and diagnostic criteria around the world, said Dr. Chris Smith, a specialist in virology at the University of Cambridge. In the most extreme example, China’s case count skyrocketed when it began recording positives based on people’s symptoms, rather than a on lab test, the method most countries are still using. But even lab tests might yield different results in different places, depending on the targets labs are using and the ways health workers collect and process specimens.

European leaders, in a three-hour teleconference on Tuesday night, agreed to set up a 25 billion euro investment fund, or $28.1 billion, and to relax rules governing airlines to curb the economic fallout.But they failed to overcome national objections to sharing medical equipment like face masks and respirators, given that health issues are the responsibility of national governments. Germany, the Czech Republic and other countries have tightened export restrictions on this gear to keep it for their own citizens.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s warning that the virus would infect 60 percent to 70 percent of people in Germany — a figure she attributed to the “consensus among experts” — was the most forthright admission of the scale of the problem by any world leader. It was fully in character for a physicist-turned-politician, reinforcing her status as the liberal West’s foil to Mr. Trump.“We will do whatever is needed,” she said. “We won’t ask every day, ‘What does this mean for our deficit?’” “Different countries are doing different things,” Dr. Smith said of the testing programs. “You’re not comparing apples to apples.”The rise of populism has exacerbated the problem by reducing the incentives of countries to cooperate.

The abuse in the four countries that Mr. Pompeo cited included the cases of Wang Meiyu, who died in prison after he was arrested in July for demanding elections in China, and of Pouya Bakhtiari, who was shot in the head by Iranian security forces during protests in November. Mr. Bakhtiari’s family was later arrested on counterterrorism charges.“We pray for a day when Cubans, Venezuelans, Chinese, Iranians and all peoples can speak and assemble freely without fear of their own governments,” Mr. Pompeo told journalists on Wednesday at the State Department.He said the report “honors those I’ve named and who have paid the ultimate sacrifice fighting for freedom and for human dignity.”Each presidential administration has put its own political imprint on the annual review of human rights abuses by governments around the world. In years past, diplomats have focused on extreme examples — including China’s detention camps in 2018 or chemical weapons attacks in Syria in 2013 — to name and shame specific nations.But Mr. Pompeo detailed crackdowns on political protests, free speech and privacy — abuses seen in many countries — to single out China, Cuba, Iran and Venezuela.

(It did, however, condemn forced abortions in North Korea, as well as the persecution of gay people in Russia.)Additionally, the report found evidence of systematic corruption and human rights abuses in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras — where the Trump administration is trying to return migrants who cross the southwestern border in search of asylum.Joanne Lin of Amnesty International said that was an example of a foreign policy that leaves “people in dangerous and deadly conditions around the world with no help from the White House.” In Turkey, the report found, political dissidents were “disappeared” or victims of attempted kidnappings.

And the State Department has for years been critical of civil liberties abuses in Iran, politically motivated arrests in Cuba, and increasingly authoritarian leadership in Venezuela where, in 2019, a political uprising challenged President Nicolás Maduro in a continuing revolt.Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Mr. Pompeo’s focus on China, Cuba, Iran and Venezuela was of his own choosing and, regardless, they “reflect current American policy.”“Any fair-minded person who reads these reports will see that they’re pretty hard-hitting across the board,” Mr. Destro told reporters after Mr. Pompeo’s remarks.

On at least 10 forms traced to Ms. Hall, officials said, the party affiliations of already-registered Democrats and Independents had been switched to Republican. More than 100 others that may be tied to her contained missing or bogus data such as wrong birth dates.Ms. Hall was a canvasser for Florida First Inc., a recently created nonprofit that is financed at least in part by a dark-money group formed by Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and other Trump associates.

He said he hopes to meet with other election officials and voter groups soon to “find out what measures we can take to prevent this from happening again.” The most cited example of registration irregularities involved the left-leaning community organizing group commonly known as ACORN whose registration drives became a target of fraud accusations by Republicans during the 2008 presidential campaign. The group said it had hired 13,000 registration canvassers and signed up 1.3 million new voters in 2007 and 2008; a handful of those workers were found guilty of fraud, such as registering children and nonexistent voters.The group said most charges were politically inflated — in some cases, it maintained, workers were cited for bogus registrations that they actually had flagged for election workers. But it said in a statement in 2008 that “in any endeavor of this size, some people will engage in inappropriate conduct.” The controversy forced ACORN to shut down in 2010.Other examples have occurred over time: a Los Angeles voter drive that paid $2.50 in 1992 for each new registration and enrolled a dead person and a baby; an Orange County, Calif., drive in 2006 by a Republican contractor that switched 65 voters from Democrats to Republicans; a 2010 campaign by a pro-Democrat labor union that filed as many as a thousand suspicious forms; a Pennsylvania college student who pleaded guilty in 2017 to creating 18 fake registrations to help a co-worker meet a quota.

While such fraud is a serious matter, it generally poses a less serious threat to the integrity of elections, said David J.

"It was a concession speech, of a kind: Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders bowed not to Joseph R. Biden Jr., who trounced him in a second consecutive week of primary elections, but to the reality of his political predicament. Stripped of his briefly held status as the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was “losing” to Mr. Biden but stopped short of accepting defeat.That careful distinction — between accepting Mr. Biden’s dominance in the race, and yielding to him altogether — now defines Mr. Sanders’s candidacy, and perhaps the Democratic presidential race as a whole.For in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was more visibly humbled than at nearly any other point since he emerged as a national figure five years ago, during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton. There was no defiant battle cry on Wednesday, no vow to fight Mr. Biden all the way to the Milwaukee convention in July, no allegation of election-rigging or insinuation of an establishment conspiracy like he memorably made in 2016.There was, instead, a matter-of-fact assessment of his own diminished position in the race, followed by an equally unsparing recitation of the policy challenges Mr. Sanders intended to put to Mr. Biden in the coming days.

Reaching for a kind of moral victory, Mr. Sanders insisted that his campaign had “won the ideological debate,” but allowed that he had not persuaded most voters that he was the likeliest candidate to defeat President Trump.Taken together, it was a stark moment of political de-escalation. Some Democratic officials interpreted it as a signal that Mr. Sanders may not be thirsting for a fight to the bitter end, of the kind he waged against Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Even his criticism of Mr. Biden was largely implicit, framed in terms of questions — about health care, climate change, immigration and more — that seemed intended to push Mr. Biden to address the concerns of Mr. Sanders’s political base.The great question of the Democratic race may now be whether there is anything Mr. Biden can do to assuage those concerns, and how Mr. Sanders might respond if he does.Representative Peter Welch of Vermont, who is supporting Mr. Sanders, said that the senator sent a clear sign about his political priorities by emphasizing that defeating Mr. Trump was a goal of overriding importance. While Mr. Welch said it was up to Mr. Sanders to decide when his campaign was over, he was already suggesting on Wednesday that Mr. Sanders consider going on a “unity tour” to bring the Democratic Party together.“At some point, we’re going to have to unify to achieve the overarching goal of defeating Donald Trump,” Mr. Welch said, calling Mr. Sanders a figure with unique potential to achieve that goal: “Bernie, more than any other person in this country, can help Biden be the person who defeats Donald Trump.” Reaching for a kind of moral victory, Mr. Sanders insisted that his campaign had “won the ideological debate,” but allowed that he had not persuaded most voters that he was the likeliest candidate to defeat President Trump.Taken together, it was a stark moment of political de-escalation.

So far, Mr. Biden has shown no inclination to attempt any coercive measures: In his victory speech on Tuesday evening, the former vice president hailed the energy and commitment of Mr. Sanders’s supporters and offered himself to them as an ally, but made no suggestion that Mr. Sanders should stand aside.By no means is Mr. Sanders giving Mr. Biden a free pass, however. If his tone was more subdued and the content more clinical — like a policy questionnaire distributed to officeseekers — his remarks on Wednesday cataloged considerable skepticism of Mr. Biden and his competing political vision.“Joe,” he asked, “how are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system?”“What are you going to do to make sure that all of our people can go to college or trade school regardless of their income?”“What are you going to do about the millions of people who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt?”Still, after Mr. Biden’s string of wins on Tuesday night, both camps seem to recognize that the two men will most likely need to find ways to bring Democrats together behind Mr. Biden this fall. It is a dual challenge that does not play to either man’s strengths: convincing a zealous collection of young and progressive voters that Mr. Biden — an institutionalist moderate who speaks of record players and long-dead Senate colleagues — is the man to meet the moment.

For Mr. Sanders, who has spent the past year suggesting that any candidate besides himself would be insufficiently bold for the times, an eventual endorsement for Mr. Biden would not necessarily persuade admirers that an establishment Democrat should be trusted. It might take a more robust show of support from Mr. Sanders, and even then there is no guarantee that the affections of Mr. Sanders’s base can be transferred.

For Mr. Biden, who has antagonized Mr. Sanders as a non-Democrat out to diminish the presidency of Barack Obama, even a firm insistence that he understands what is driving Sanders voters will be viewed skeptically.But despite Mr. Biden’s success during the last two weeks of primaries, he will need to make gains with some key Sanders constituencies — not only younger liberals but also Latinos across several age brackets — to build the most formidable coalition possible in the fall. And he will almost certainly need Mr. Sanders’s help to get there.Some veterans of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign would advise Mr. Biden not to expect much. Though Mr. Sanders officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and rallied for her, her aides generally viewed the endorsement as somewhere between dutiful and inadequate — especially when weighed against the months of negative attacks from Mr. Sanders and his supporters depicting her as a corporate tool well after she appeared to have the nomination in hand.There is some reason to believe that this election might be different. Mr. Sanders appears to harbor much less visceral disdain for his opponent than he did in 2016, when he and his aides seethed constantly at the perceived coronation of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders has never attacked Mr. Biden’s character or his personal ethics, even as a good number of his political allies have done so repeatedly.“It needs to be a two-way dance,” said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton’s national press secretary four years ago, noting that even a progressive like Senator Elizabeth Warren had been found wanting by Sanders fans. “What the courting looks like, what will actually satisfy large chunks of his movement, is a mystery. So much of that movement could not even find Warren as an acceptable alternative. So, what the heck can Joe Biden do?”Mr. Fallon did have a few ideas: namely, some policy drift toward Mr. Sanders’s platform on climate or health care issues from the Biden camp if Mr. Sanders leaves the race.

At the moment, the Sanders base appears in no mood to settle.

Zogby, a longtime Sanders ally who is the president of the Arab American Institute, in an interview on Tuesday night.Mr. Sanders, he said, had a longer legacy than a presidential campaign: “He is a transformative figure in our political life.” At the moment, the Sanders base appears in no mood to settle.

Mr. Welch, who has risen in Vermont politics alongside Mr. Sanders for more than three decades, urged his colleague not to bank on an astounding turn of fortune of the kind Mr. Biden enjoyed after the South Carolina primary.“We basically had a miracle in this election a couple weeks ago,” Mr. Welch said. “And Joe Biden was the beneficiary of that miracle.”For Mr. Sanders to expect another, he added, would be “asking a lot of the higher powers.” It falls now to Mr. Sanders to square his grand stature, as an individual leader, with the perilous state of his presidential campaign.

"Joseph R. Biden Jr. is drastically modifying his campaign schedule in the coming days in response to mounting anxieties about the coronavirus, trading traditional get-out-the-vote-style gatherings for “virtual events,” his campaign announced Wednesday.The move marked the beginning of an extraordinary new chapter in an already tumultuous presidential race: campaigning amid a pandemic.Mr. Biden’s campaign had previously canceled an event slated for Thursday in Tampa, Fla., as well as a Cleveland rally on Tuesday night. Now, a Friday event in Chicago and a Monday stop in Miami will be turned into “virtual events,” the former vice president’s team said in a statement, hours after rolling out a “Public Health Advisory Committee” to guide the campaign that included several prominent former Obama administration officials.“We have been and will continue to consult with relevant officials, including our recently announced Public Health Advisory Committee, regarding steps the campaign should take to minimize health risks for staff and supporters,” the statement said. “As a result of those conversations and at the request of elected officials in Illinois and Florida, we will no longer hold large crowd events on Friday and Monday in those states.” Joseph R.

The president had indicated in recent days that he had been briefed on the law and could use it to address the pandemic, and Democratic lawmakers like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, have been pressing him to invoke it.“We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. “I have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act. And if I need to do something, I’ll do it.

American officials are considering escalating containment measures.If the coronavirus outbreak grows even more dire in the United States, officials may need to turn to government measures even more disruptive than the event prohibitions and school closures announced this week.In Washington State, where more than 30 people have died from the virus, more than anywhere else in the country, public health officials have escalated through most of a 13-step strategy checklist for controlling infectious outbreaks and now have only a few remaining options: closing workplaces, restricting people to their homes and cordoning off targeted areas to help control the spread of infection, measures that have already been put in place in other parts of the world.

Political leaders are considering their options, alarmed over research that suggests 400 people in the Seattle area could die in the coming weeks if the trajectory of the outbreak cannot be altered. The research shows that if policymakers could reduce the transmission rate by 75 percent — primarily through what is known as “social distancing” — then the number of deaths could be reduced to only about 30 in that period.Kevin Wickersham, the incident commander at Washington’s Department of Health, said that none of the options were off the table, but that officials were mindful of the tremendous burden that such restrictions could impose on families and businesses.“We want to do everything possible to keep society functioning as much as it possibly can,” Mr. Wickersham said.

The Houston Independent School District, the largest school district in Texas, also said it was closing for two weeks.The closings could have a severe effect on parents who will need to find child care, and on the many students who depend on the cafeteria for food and the school for shelter. In Los Angeles, about 80 percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunches, and just under 20,000 are homeless at some point during the school year. The district is also the second-largest employer in California’s largest county.

Spain declares a state of emergency and orders its first mandatory lockdowns. Spain declares a state of emergency and orders its first mandatory lockdowns. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said on Friday that the country would be placed under a state of emergency for 15 days, which could allow his government to restrict the movement of citizens, ration goods and impose other measures to fight the spread of the new coronavirus.The decision came as Spain reported about 4,200 confirmed infections, the most in Europe after Italy. The Spanish death toll reached 120 on Friday.Earlier Friday, Spain ordered its first mandatory lockdowns, of four towns in Catalonia, with about 70,000 people.In a brief televised address, Mr. Sánchez said that the state of emergency would come into force on Saturday, after a ministerial meeting, and that it was designed to use “all the resources of the state to protect better the citizens, especially those who are most vulnerable to the virus.” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said on Friday that the country would be placed under a state of emergency for 15 days, which could allow his government to restrict the movement of citizens, ration goods and impose other measures to fight the spread of the new coronavirus.The decision came as Spain reported about 4,200 confirmed infections, the most in Europe after Italy.

The law also allows the government to requisition factories and other infrastructure. Parliament must approve an extension.The only other time that Spain declared a state of emergency was in 2010, when the government ordered the military to break up a wildcat strike by air traffic controllers that brought to air traffic to a standstill.

China is pushing a new theory about the origins of the coronavirus: It is an American disease that might have been introduced by members of the United States Army who visited Wuhan in October.There is not a shred of evidence to support that, but the notion received an official endorsement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose spokesman accused American officials of not coming clean about what they know about the disease.China, under diplomatic pressure for the early missteps in handling the outbreak, has sought to deflect attention from those failings at home and abroad and now turned to a well-worn practice of blaming internal problems on foreign actors.“The conspiracy theories are a new, low front in what they clearly perceive as a global competition over the narrative of this crisis,” Julian B. Gewirtz, a scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard, said of the Chinese.

"Louisiana will postpone its April 4 primary election for more than two months, officials announced on Friday, becoming the first state in the nation to adjust its elections in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The news comes as officials in the next four states scheduled to vote in the presidential primary — Ohio, Arizona, Florida and Illinois — have all indicated that they intend to hold their elections on Tuesday as planned, issuing a joint statement on Friday expressing confidence that ballots can be safely cast. The sudden decision by Louisiana comes as the viral outbreak has upended the presidential campaigns and people worry about gatherings and places where they might become infected. “Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring,” Louisiana’s secretary of state, R.

Here’s a look at what is happening in each state.OhioFrank LaRose, the Ohio secretary of state, has directed all county election boards to relocate voting locations that are near places where a high concentration of older people live, and county officials have been working to find new polling sites.On Wednesday, the county boards reported to the secretary of state’s office that they had identified 128 locations around the state that would need to be changed. In Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, 26 polling locations have been moved.Ohio, which has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus, has also expanded curbside drop-off of absentee ballots in response to the outbreak, to help keep those who are vulnerable away from crowds. As of Wednesday, the state had received roughly 336,000 absentee ballot requests. compared with about 328,000 at the same point in 2016.Another worry is the availability of poll workers, a volunteer group that skews older, and whose absence on Election Day could lead to longer lines and bigger crowds. In Ohio, the secretary of state’s office said it had been “proactively requesting additional recruitment from state and local government employees, outside organizations and even college students to step up and serve Ohio as poll workers.”“In fact, as of early this afternoon, we’ve had 582 Ohioans sign up to be poll workers just since Tuesday,” said Jon Keeling, the communications director for Mr. LaRose. “We’ve been thrilled with how many have stepped up.” But at this point, none of the states are considering expanding polling hours or mail-in-ballot deadlines. Perhaps the most significant shift will be the relocation of polling stations away from areas where older people live, like assisted living facilities.

In Ohio, the secretary of state’s office said it had been “proactively requesting additional recruitment from state and local government employees, outside organizations and even college students to step up and serve Ohio as poll workers.”“In fact, as of early this afternoon, we’ve had 582 Ohioans sign up to be poll workers just since Tuesday,” said Jon Keeling, the communications director for Mr. LaRose. “We’ve been thrilled with how many have stepped up.” IllinoisTwo of the largest voting jurisdictions in Illinois, Cook County and Chicago, obtained a court order on Thursday that will allow the counties to issue vote-by-mail ballots to all nursing home residents in their jurisdictions. The order also removes the requirement to send election judges into nursing homes to conduct voting.“Nursing homes around the state are withdrawing as polling places, so local election authorities are relocating polling places and sending out statutorily required notifications to affected voters,” said Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections. He said that included more than 100 locations in the Chicago area.FloridaIn Florida, which has also declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has urged county elections supervisors to move polling places out of assisted living facilities.“That’s problematic,” he told reporters on Wednesday in Tallahassee, the state capital, adding that residents should still be able to vote there, but not the general public.“I think there’s a way to do that,” he said. “That’s a prudent step to take.”The state has temporarily restricted visits to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult family-care homes, long-term care facilities and adult group homes to keep out international and cruise ship travelers and other people who might have been exposed to the coronavirus.In Broward County, where a small cluster of coronavirus cases has been tied to the Port Everglades seaport, the elections department plans to move six polling places out of assisted living facilities. Those locations asked for the change, but not all senior facilities have, in part because they want residents to have the convenience of voting there, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for Supervisor Peter Antonacci.The department has bought “oodles” of soap, paper towels, rubbing alcohol and wipes, he added.

The secretary of state’s office also urged people to cast ballots in person at early-voting sites, which are open until Friday.In a news release on Wednesday, Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state in Arizona, said she wanted to “remind voters to make a plan for participating in this election.”In Maricopa County, the state’s largest and home to Phoenix, county officials had already made preparations for Election Day, including building a large pool of possible poll workers, though they anticipate receiving more than 80 percent of votes by mail.“We have statutory minimum for keeping a polling place open, and we’ve staffed significantly higher than that,” said Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder. “We’ve already built in a pretty big cushion.”Mr. Fontes said that officials planned to sterilize the voting machines every half-hour and would have hand sanitizer at every location. And while the virus may depress in-person turnout, he said, his county has already seen a surge in mail-in votes. “We’re putting signs at every precinct encouraging everybody approaching to wash their hands,” Mr. Vancore said. “We have plenty of Purell hand sanitizer available.

During that speech, Mr. Trump announced a temporary partial ban on travel to the United States from Europe, but he stopped short of instituting nationwide limits on public gatherings or the kind of other federal guidance that some world leaders have given to their countries. During that speech, Mr. Trump announced a temporary partial ban on travel to the United States from Europe, but he stopped short of instituting nationwide limits on public gatherings or the kind of other federal guidance that some world leaders have given to their countries. Over all, Americans are skeptical of Mr. Trump’s ability to confront the crisis. Last month, before the virus had spread throughout the United States, 62 percent of voters nationwide said they were not very confident in the federal government’s ability to deal with it effectively, according to a Fox News poll. Democratic voters were more than twice as likely as Republicans to say that they had no confidence at all.For weeks, Mr. Trump oscillated between reassurances that he had the situation under control and suggestions that the whole issue was vastly overblown.

On Thursday, both candidates strongly criticized Mr. Trump’s address to the nation.“Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president,” Mr. Biden said. He offered his own plan to combat the crisis while condemning what he called Mr. Trump’s “colossal” failure to guarantee citizens access to coronavirus testing.For Mr. Trump, the perception that he is a strong leader has been central to his appeal since the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign. Gallup regularly asks Americans about their feelings about the president on a range of personal qualities. Out of the seven qualities Gallup tests, only one applies to Mr. Trump in the eyes of a majority of Americans: being a strong and decisive leader. When Mr. Biden attacks him over the coronavirus, he is taking a cut at Americans’ view of Mr. Trump as a forceful leader.But the virus may have an effect on Mr. Trump’s public approval in ways that ripple far beyond his direct response to the crisis — particularly as the economy absorbs the severe impact of the virus.Before the outbreak, Americans were more likely to describe themselves as satisfied with the way things were going in the country than at any point in the past 15 years, according to Gallup polling. Mr. Trump’s approval ratings have been in the mid- to high 40s in recent months — among the highest numbers of his presidency — lifted by the thriving economy.

"WASHINGTON — As he confronts the most serious crisis of his tenure, President Trump has been assertive in closing borders to many outsiders, one of his favorite policies. But within the United States, as the coronavirus spreads from one community to another, he has been more follower than leader.While he presents himself as the nation’s commanding figure, Mr. Trump has essentially become a bystander as school superintendents, sports commissioners, college presidents, governors and business owners across the country take it upon themselves to shut down much of American life without clear guidance from the president.For weeks, he resisted telling Americans to cancel or stay away from large gatherings, reluctant even on Thursday to call off his own campaign rallies even as he grudgingly acknowledged he would probably have to. Instead, it fell to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s most famous scientist, to say publicly what the president would not, leading the nation’s basketball, hockey, soccer and baseball leagues in just 24 hours to suspend play and call off tournaments.Mayors and county executives, hospital executives and factory owners received no further direction from the president as he talked about the virus in the Oval Office on Thursday than they did during his prime-time address to the nation the night before.

Mr. Trump had no hesitance to kibbitz from the side before he became president, assailing President Barack Obama for not doing enough to stop Ebola, for instance. But his own White House has separated into camps of those who think the administration needs to be doing more and those who share — and reinforce — Mr. Trump’s own view that the news media is overreacting to and creating a panic around the coronavirus.After feeling besieged by enemies for three years, Mr. Trump and some of his advisers view so many issues through the lens of political warfare — assuming that criticism is all about point scoring — that it has become hard to see what is real and what is not, according to people around the president.

Marc Short, Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, approached Mr. Kushner on Monday about integrating the White House teams working on the issue, as the vice president’s communications shop is overrun with media requests and the White House is changing the chief of staff. After that, Mr. Kushner seized more of a role, spending Wednesday with Mr. Trump, the officials said. One administration official said on Thursday that Mr. Kushner, his wife, Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser who has just returned to the White House, favored Mr. Trump giving Wednesday night’s prime-time address to calm the waters amid rampaging uncertainty and fear. One administration official said on Thursday that Mr. Kushner, his wife, Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser who has just returned to the White House, favored Mr. Trump giving Wednesday night’s prime-time address to calm the waters amid rampaging uncertainty and fear. Ms. Trump, the president’s elder daughter, in particular favored the address, according to three administration officials. But the subject quickly became contentious internally, according to several administration officials. Drafts were written and rewritten, beginning around 5 p.m., with Mr. Kushner seen as in charge as the president’s chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, wrote, and the communications office of the West Wing left out of the discussions.By early evening, only two hours before the camera was to go on, it was still not entirely clear what Mr. Trump was going to say. In a meeting in the Cabinet Room, a number of top officials told the president the speech was a good idea, with a notable exception being the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who said that Mr. Trump ought to wait at least a day or two so as to provide officials with more information. The president told aides gathered in the room, who disagreed on exactly how far he should go in terms of a travel ban from Europe, to come up with something and bring it to him, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events.The health experts were either supportive of or neutral about a proposed ban on some European travelers, even as Mr. Mnuchin disagreed, and so the plan moved forward, with other items — like more specific recommendations for schools and crowds — left unmentioned.When the camera turned on, the president appeared uncomfortable, reading words from the teleprompter in a stiff manner that made no emotional connection to a television audience of millions scared about a virus they cannot see and uncertain about a society rapidly transforming around them.Even with the text on the screen, the president mischaracterized his own policies in a way that required his administration to correct him afterward. Administration officials said there were two errors in the teleprompter text, and one that Mr. Trump garbled as he read it, adding the word “only” in a sentence that was intended to say the ban did not apply to trade and cargo, a line that spooked markets.He referred to the pandemic as a “foreign virus” that “will not have a chance against us” as if it were a hostile nation to be defeated on the battlefield. But while he talked about measures to prop up the economy, he did not discuss the troubles with the availability of testing kits or express understanding of the changes in everyday life affecting so many Americans.

Some close aides did not think the errors in the speech were particularly significant. By Thursday morning, it was clear that the speech had not assuaged the financial markets, which plummeted another 10 percent, the worst single day since Black Monday in 1987. Together with the losses of recent weeks, the markets have now erased about 85 percent of the gains of the entire Trump presidency, gains that were the foundation of his argument for re-election.

Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, which had just harshly criticized the president’s “failures of leadership” in handling the outbreak, saw some progress in the speech even as he expressed concern that it would not last.“The speech represents a marked, welcome improvement in the president’s rhetoric,” he wrote, “but that won’t matter if he goes out and undercuts it tomorrow, and the ultimate verdict on his response will be rendered based on the results.”The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page likewise called the speech “a step toward more realism” but added that Mr. Trump was not forthcoming enough about the scope of the problem.Republicans close to the White House privately laid blame at the feet of Mr. Kushner. A person close to Mr. Kushner described that as unfair, saying that he was merely helping out and that it becomes easier to blame him when things are difficult. And in any case, a partial travel ban on Europe was a bold move that may have been bound to rattle the markets rather than calm them no matter what.The White House insisted that the president’s actions have had the support of health officials, and that local communities should make decisions based on their own conditions.

Speaking on NBC’s “Today” show, Mr. Pence agreed it was wrong to dismiss the outbreak as hype. “Obviously there’s been some irresponsible rhetoric, but the American people should know that President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the people of this country,” he said, without identifying who was responsible for the irresponsible rhetoric.As for Mr. Trump’s call on Washington in his speech to “stop the partisanship,” that lasted just nine hours, at least some of which he was presumably asleep.

"WASHINGTON — When America’s financial system teetered on the brink in September 2008, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., knelt down in the White House’s Roosevelt Room and pleaded with Speaker Nancy Pelosi not to withdraw her support for a $700 billion bailout package that was intended to fend off an economic collapse.“It’s not me blowing this up. It’s the Republicans,” Ms. Pelosi famously said, teasing Mr. Paulson, a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, for taking a knee. “I didn’t know you were Catholic.”A dozen years later, a protégé of Mr. Paulson’s at Goldman Sachs, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, faces a similar task, engaging in down-to-the wire negotiations with Ms. Pelosi over an emergency stimulus package to prevent the global spread of the coronavirus from crippling the economy in an election year.But while President George W. Bush was loathed by Democrats at the end of his second term, President Trump and Ms. Pelosi, who less than three months ago oversaw his impeachment, share even less good will.

With financial markets in free fall and the threat of a recession growing, Mr. Trump has turned to Mr. Mnuchin, one of his longest-serving and most loyal cabinet members, to try to broker a bipartisan compromise with a lawmaker the president has referred to as “crazy Nancy,” “a crazed lunatic,” someone “not operating with a full deck” and the “absolute worst Speaker of the House.”“They know they need each other,” said Tony Fratto, who served as the Treasury Department’s top spokesman under Mr. Paulson and as deputy White House press secretary under Mr. Bush. “If not Mnuchin, who else would the speaker rather be talking to right now?”Mr. Mnuchin’s role as a bipartisan bridge is not the most natural shift: He has fiercely protected the president and drawn scorn from Democrats for shielding Mr. Trump’s tax returns, as well as continuing to insist, despite evidence to the contrary, that the 2017 tax cut Republicans passed will pay for itself. At a House hearing last year, Mr. Mnuchin got into a testy exchange with Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, when he tried to leave the hearing before she was ready for it to end.

The president has been known to change his mind at the last minute, throwing things into disarray. Mr. Trump’s tweet on Friday calling for a payroll tax cut, which has been a nonstarter for Democrats, raised fears that the negotiations could unravel. Mr. Mnuchin has spent the week crisscrossing Pennsylvania Avenue to meet with Ms. Pelosi and the two have talked repeatedly on the phone. On Tuesday, after Mr. Mnuchin briefed Senate Republicans at the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi spontaneously invited him to her office. The two sometimes call each other directly on their cellphones. By early Friday afternoon, Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Pelosi had already spoken by telephone six times as they raced to strike an agreement to provide government support to workers and businesses affected by the virus.The two sides parried behind the scenes as Republicans resisted a broad proposal to provide paid sick leave and pushed for the inclusion of language into the emergency package to ensure that federal funding could not be used for most abortions. At a news conference, Ms. Pelosi called Mr. Mnuchin’s suggested changes to the legislation “very reasonable.”At first blush, a constructive relationship might seem unlikely. When Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Pelosi shared a table last year at the annual Alfalfa dinner, Politico quipped that Gérard Araud, the French ambassador sitting between them, had the “most awkward seat.” But Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Pelosi both hail from California and over the years, they have crossed paths and exchanged pleasantries in social circles.An aide to Ms. Pelosi said that her relationship with the secretary was “cordial” and “operational” and that she appreciated that he is a realist when it came to recognizing facts for what they are. A senior Treasury official said that Mr. Mnuchin viewed Ms. Pelosi as a “shrewd professional” and someone with whom he had a good personal rapport.In a White House filled with ideologues, few have been able to work successfully across the aisle. Maneuvering with Congress has not always come easily for Mr. Mnuchin, a former banker, hedge fund manager and Hollywood producer who had never worked in government before he was tapped for Treasury secretary after serving as the finance director of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.His initial foray into congressional diplomacy was not smooth: Mr. Mnuchin served as chief pitchman for the president’s 2017 tax cut, rankling Democrats by producing a one-page economic assessment of a nearly 500-page bill that claimed the $1.5 trillion package would not add to the budget deficit. When he urged Republican House members to support debt ceiling legislation as a favor to him, they groaned and hissed at the request.But by last year Mr. Mnuchin found himself on firmer footing. With the country facing the prospect of defaulting on its borrowing obligations, Mr. Mnuchin was assigned by Mr. Trump to work with Ms. Pelosi to reach a budget deal. During a meeting last June in Ms. Pelosi’s office, Mr. Mnuchin impressed the speaker when he said he was prepared to stay until they found a solution, according to a person who heard the exchange.

During a meeting last June in Ms. Pelosi’s office, Mr. Mnuchin impressed the speaker when he said he was prepared to stay until they found a solution, according to a person who heard the exchange. Faced with a pandemic, the stakes are much higher. Mr. Mnuchin said this week that he expected to return to Congress repeatedly this year to plug the inevitable holes in the economy that will erupt from a virus that has sickened more than 1,600 people in the United States and contributed to at least 41 deaths.Veterans of the 2008 financial crisis suggest that, in many respects, the path ahead for Mr. Mnuchin could be more challenging than what Mr. Paulson faced because the economic fallout from the virus could be so unpredictable.“Policy stimulus — both fiscal and monetary — works by stimulating demand,” said Neil Shearing, an economist at Capital Economics. “It therefore had a clear role to play in 2008. But its role today is less obvious.”He added, “The speed of recovery will depend in large part on how the virus spreads and when the containment measures are lifted and life returns to normal.”Further complicating the response are the personal dynamics of the team assembled to combat the economic fallout. In 2008, Mr. Paulson and the Fed chair, Ben S. Bernanke, were largely united in their views about what was needed to prop up the financial system and Mr. Paulson was empowered by the White House to fashion a rescue plan.But the current White House team of economic advisers has suffered from mixed messaging and infighting during the last three years. Mr. Trump has continually beaten up on his Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, accusing him of acting too slowly and putting the United States at an economic disadvantage — criticisms which have only escalated during the virus outbreak.

Mr. Trump also continues to push ideas that Mr. Mnuchin has privately discouraged. The president has called for a payroll tax holiday, an idea pressed by Peter Navarro, his top trade adviser. But Mr. Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, remain privately skeptical and Democrats have called the idea a “nonstarter.” Mr. Trump also continues to push ideas that Mr. Mnuchin has privately discouraged.

But Mr. Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, remain privately skeptical and Democrats have called the idea a “nonstarter.” A bigger complication may be the unpredictability of Mr. Trump. Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman who led the bailout negotiations with Ms. Pelosi in 2008, recalled that Mr. Paulson was fully empowered to negotiate on behalf of Mr. Bush, making it easier for Democrats to cut deals with him. Although Mr. Mnuchin has earned Mr. Trump’s trust, the president has shown an inclination to abruptly change course in the final stretch of a deal — even if it undercuts his negotiators.“Trump is the wild card here,” Mr. Frank said. “I think Mnuchin believes it’s important to not have this crash, but it depends on Trump.”Mr. Mnuchin does appear to have learned some lessons from the experience of Mr. Paulson, whom he considered a mentor at Goldman Sachs and still speaks to regularly.In 2008, when Mr. Paulson unveiled his plan to shore up the shaky financial system, he labeled the proposal the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The program quickly was billed as a bailout, making it deeply unpopular and Mr. Paulson a lightning rod for criticism.When Mr. Mnuchin went before Congress this week and laid out plans to help industries stricken by the coronavirus, he emphasized that the assistance would be in the form of loan guarantees that would be repaid to the government.Anticipating the likely pushback, he said, “We are not looking for bailouts.” A bigger complication may be the unpredictability of Mr. Trump.

Although Mr. Mnuchin has earned Mr. Trump’s trust, the president has shown an inclination to abruptly change course in the final stretch of a deal — even if it undercuts his negotiators.“Trump is the wild card here,” Mr. Frank said. “I think Mnuchin believes it’s important to not have this crash, but it depends on Trump.”Mr. Mnuchin does appear to have learned some lessons from the experience of Mr. Paulson, whom he considered a mentor at Goldman Sachs and still speaks to regularly.In 2008, when Mr. Paulson unveiled his plan to shore up the shaky financial system, he labeled the proposal the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

"It seems almost churlish to compare a speech by President Donald J. Trump in 2020 to one by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1940. In the canon of reassurance — the model for how a leader might address a nation on edge — Churchill’s “We Shall Fight on the Beaches” address to the House of Commons after the mass evacuation of British forces at Dunkirk during World War II sets an extremely high bar.Churchill’s address was rousing, electrifying and memorable, at once a sober account of a failed military operation, a soaring declaration of patriotic resolve and a frank admission that the situation was very serious indeed. “Wars are not won by evacuations,” Churchill said.Churchill was a preternaturally gifted writer, orator and student of history. But as Americans watched President Trump’s speech about the coronavirus pandemic from the White House on Wednesday night, with its flat delivery, its failure to acknowledge any government missteps, its lack of empathy for patients needing testing or medical care and its sour undercurrent of score-settling with Europe, it was hard not to imagine how the former prime minister — or Lincoln, or Kennedy, or F.D.R. — might have confronted such an emergency. It was hard not to yearn for words of reassurance.Perhaps recognizing that his speech did not have whatever effect he had hoped for, the president announced Friday that he would address the nation again that afternoon.

Even The Wall Street Journal editorial board, generally supportive of Mr. Trump’s policies if not his rhetoric and personal style, scolded the president for his uninspiring performance, for treating the crisis as mostly a political threat to his own power, for deploying his typical tactics of denying and blaming. The president’s greatest opponent now, it said in an editorial, was not former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democrats’ most likely presidential nominee, but the coronavirus.“The best response to that is to acknowledge the delay, explain what happened, and relate when and how the problem will be addressed,” the editorial said. “Above all, leadership in a crisis means telling the public the truth, lest people begin to tune him out or, worse, make him a figure of mockery.”Or, as Dr. Dena Grayson, a medical researcher and Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Florida in 2016, said on CNN: “You can’t spin death.”The doctor is right; it’s hard to spin death, as much as the president may try to lay the blame for the crisis elsewhere: on Europe, on China, on former President Barack Obama. It may be even harder now to set the tone for a nation, even with a bullhorn as loud as the president’s, when social media provides a platform for such a cacophony of voices and countervoices. But people in a country in trouble look to the president to help explain, to help soothe, to reassure them that although things might be bad, we will eventually be all right.

If the president won’t or can’t do it, then people look to alternative leaders for reassurance and guidance, as they did to Rudolph W. Giuliani, then mayor of New York, after the 9/11 attacks. (Mr. Giuliani is now Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer.) That was the sense that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was trying to convey in his speech about the gravity of the coronavirus threat on Thursday. And it was what Mr. Biden meant to do in his address on Thursday — to hold himself up as a reassuring, steady alternative to Mr. Trump, to show that he was competent, sympathetic, forceful and presidential. “I’ll always tell you the truth,” he said. “This is the responsibility of a president.” If the president won’t or can’t do it, then people look to alternative leaders for reassurance and guidance, as they did to Rudolph W.

Presidents need to be straightforward and candid from the beginning, said David M. Litt, who worked as a speechwriter in the Obama White House. They need to admit the early shortcomings in their response, lay out what steps they will take to improve, and then provide regular updates.“The number one thing you have to do is figure out how to address the problem — and to make it clear where you can and can’t solve it,” Mr. Litt said. Dissembling about it — as in Mr. Trump’s assertion, earlier in the crisis, that coronavirus would just “go away,” or his claim that it was just like the flu, or his blatant contradiction of his own experts on how long it would take to come up with a vaccine — is never helpful, Mr. Litt said.“You have to be honest about it, that you can’t bring the number of cases down to zero,” he added. “A good response would be where you say that people will suffer and in some cases die — and that’s awful and graphic — but the least you can do is explain the situation.”That is what the current British prime minister, Boris Johnson, did in a recent news conference. Until recently, he has tended to play down the threat as much as Mr. Trump has; on Thursday, his expression somber and his voice grave, Mr. Johnson said the coronavirus was “the worst public health crisis for a generation.”In Germany earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel was also blunt. “We have to understand that many people will be infected,” she said. “The consensus among experts is that 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected as long as this remains the situation.” Recent American history has certainly provided enough disasters that required presidents to rise to an occasion: not just the 9/11 attacks but also the 2008 economic crisis, countless gun massacres, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for starters.

Rather than discussing the magnitude of the crisis, the president talked about the magnitude of the “nation’s unprecedented response.” Nor did he seem particularly concerned about stepping back from the moment to offer existential words of wisdom or comfort, as President Ronald Reagan did so memorably, for example, in a lyrical speech in 1986, after the space shuttle Challenger exploded.A nation had watched the space shuttle take off; a nation had watched it split apart, in real time; a nation was in shock.“We will never forget them,” Mr. Reagan said of the astronauts who lost their lives, “nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.”It always helps to look to Shakespeare, and what he said about power and leadership, at times like these (and indeed, both Churchill and another greater soother and orator, Lincoln, were avid students of Shakespeare).“In every play, Shakespeare has a leader whom he puts under terrible pressure, and then he puts them under more pressure, and ultimately their limitations and weaknesses are revealed and they fail to rise to the occasion,” said James Shapiro, professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University and author, most recently, of “Shakespeare in a Divided America.”“The very thing that puts you in power prevents you from seeing what’s going to remove you from power,” said Mr. Shapiro, who was preparing for the abrupt end of in-person classes as Columbia shut down over the coronavirus, part of a wave of university closures. “Great leaders are those who can see what’s coming.” Contrast that with Mr. Trump and his Wednesday address.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to declare a national emergency at a news conference on Friday afternoon, a move that would give him authority to use $40 billion of funds allocated by Congress for disaster relief to address the coronavirus crisis.Mr. Trump, according to a senior administration official, is expected to invoke the Stafford Act, a law that empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist state and local governments during “natural catastrophes” and coordinate the nation’s response.Mr. Trump has been hinting in recent days that he had been briefed on using the law to address the pandemic, and Democratic lawmakers like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, have been pressing him to invoke it.Mr. Trump’s decision to employ the Stafford Act to address the coronavirus crisis was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

And if I need to do something, I’ll do it. I have the right to do a lot of things that people don’t even know about.”Still, the details of Mr. Trump’s announcement, another official cautioned, were in flux and being finalized ahead of a 3 p.m. news conference that Mr. Trump announced on Twitter Friday morning.Presidents frequently invoke the Stafford Act in response to natural disasters, like the recent tornado that killed two dozen people in Tennessee.But it is usually applied to specific states or geographic areas, not nationally, and has not often been used in the case of major public health crises. And the power it would afford the president depends on what kind of emergency he declares. The act specifies two levels — a major disaster declaration or an emergency declaration.The first is more sweeping and would authorize spending for purposes including unemployment assistance, emergency grants to seasonal workers, food coupons, relocation assistance. But a major disaster is defined very specifically under the law to be something like a hurricane, tornado, landslide or earthquake.

Mr. Carolla, who set a Guinness World Record a few years ago for downloads of his podcast, has been traveling the country examining the plague of political censorship on college campuses and recently released a documentary called “No Safe Spaces.”Mr. Stanhope is on a comedy tour he is cheekily calling the “Hand Sanitizer Tour.”“The Man Show” was a product of its time: delivered by men, for men during an era when a white comic performed in blackface without significant opposition and mused onstage that he hoped he didn’t have a gay son (Mr. Kimmel). There were sketches in which the hosts drunkenly stumbled (Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Carolla) through an airport dressed like pilots without getting stopped by the T.S.A., and previewed (Mr. Rogan and Mr. Stanhope) a series of breast implant innovations — including Nerf footballs and a condiment dispenser.Each of the former hosts either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.In the show’s first episode, in a monologue (manologue?) atop the Hoover Dam, Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Carolla asserted that “Just as these heroic men did 60 years ago, we are building a dam: a dam to hold back the tidal wave of feminization that is taking over this country; a dam to stop the estrogen that is drowning us in political correctness.” (If only they knew.)Later in the episode, they posted up at a local farmer’s market collecting signatures to “end women’s suffrage” (to be fair, “suffrage” does sound a lot like “suffering”).Some of the sketches were funny. But it’s unlikely that anyone would think “The Man Show” could exist now as it did then — though Mr. Kimmel did suggest, in a 2017 interview, that it might be an even bigger hit because “there’s more back to lash against.”Still, it does seem that “The Man Show” was in fact a launching pad for continued relevance into 2020. So what does the success of the Man Show diaspora tell us?“This year’s campaign is now officially a Man’s Show,” said Ann Johnson, an associate professor of communication studies at California State University Long Beach who published a scholarly paper on “The Man Show” back in the early 2000s. She was referring, of course, to the race for the presidency — which, even after a historically diverse field competed on the Democratic side, is almost certain to be filled by a 70-something-year-old white man.

But it’s unlikely that anyone would think “The Man Show” could exist now as it did then — though Mr. Kimmel did suggest, in a 2017 interview, that it might be an even bigger hit because “there’s more back to lash against.”Still, it does seem that “The Man Show” was in fact a launching pad for continued relevance into 2020. So what does the success of the Man Show diaspora tell us?“This year’s campaign is now officially a Man’s Show,” said Ann Johnson, an associate professor of communication studies at California State University Long Beach who published a scholarly paper on “The Man Show” back in the early 2000s. She was referring, of course, to the race for the presidency — which, even after a historically diverse field competed on the Democratic side, is almost certain to be filled by a 70-something-year-old white man. Part of the show’s premise was that the women’s movement had driven men to the fringes. Yet the show wasn’t actually fringe at all. When it premiered, it was Comedy Central’s second most popular show, after “South Park.” More than a third of its viewers were women — and so were many of the Comedy Central executives in charge of production.“What surprised me was just how popular it actually was,” Professor Johnson said.

The idea was that the guys were in on the joke. The point was to be over the top. They were poking fun at the toxicity of men’s bad behaviors. Get it?“If you go back and look at those bits, I think everyone thinks that it was some sort of misogynistic, beer-swigging, whatever,” Mr. Carolla said in an interview last year. “The reality is we were always the butt of the joke.”It was unclear if the fans ever got that — and certainly not the ones that Mr. Kimmel has said he came to loathe. “I had no fun doing that show. It was all work for me. When the hiatus came, I was delighted,” he told GQ in 2008.Still, Comedy Central marketed the show as “a celebration of everything manly,’” as Eileen Katz, then Comedy Central’s executive vice president of programming, put it at the time. “And for women who are watching, it’s a great peek behind the zipper to find out what guys would want to do every day.”But was ogling women on trampolines really what men would do if given free rein? Maybe. Or maybe that underestimated the guys. The idea was that the guys were in on the joke. The point was to be over the top. They were poking fun at the toxicity of men’s bad behaviors.

We are in a different time now, a #MeToo world, a world in which it is unimaginable that cable television executives would greenlight “Man Show”-like behavior. Former staff members on that show, for the most part, don’t even want to talk about it. (Nearly two dozen of them either declined to comment or did not respond to requests.)Which isn’t to say that there isn’t some version of the show that could exist today.“People ask me about a new ‘The Man Show’ all the time,” said Scott A. Stone, an executive producer on the show. “The question is, what does ‘The Man Show’ look like today?”He said it was a question better answered by somebody from the next generation. Maybe, even … a woman?“There are still men, and we still laugh,” Mr. Stone said.Susan Beachy contributed research.

"The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s recent primary victories has obscured an important schism within the Democratic Party: between the older voters who carried Mr. Biden to victory and the younger voters who overwhelmingly rejected him.The dividing line is around age 45, and it is as stark as a flipped switch. In some states on Tuesday, Mr. Biden won two-thirds or more of voters older than 45, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won about two-thirds of voters younger than that.Comparatively low turnout among young voters helped save Mr. Biden in the primaries. But in the general election, a similar lack of turnout could become a huge liability — a point Mr. Sanders made explicitly on Wednesday as he announced that he would continue his campaign at least through the next debate on Sunday.“I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,” Mr. Sanders said. “You must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.” The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R.

But those plans, the young Democrats said, were not the solution to the generational gap among the candidates’ supporters; they were a cause.“The plan the Biden campaign put forward for climate change is nowhere near good enough to save our Earth,” said Benjamin Brumer, 28, who lives in California and said he felt hopeless about his future under either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden. “It will be hard, if not impossible, for them to convince me to vote for Biden. But a good first step toward reconciliation would be to make bolder promises for solving climate change.”Lindsay Huber, 29, who lives in Oregon, said that at an “absolute bare minimum,” to win her vote, Mr. Biden needed to stop accepting super PAC money and endorse both “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal.“And it would still be difficult to trust that he’s being truthful, because he has decades of racist, sexist, corporatist, warmongering votes,” Ms. Huber said. “To win us back, the Democratic Party needs to actually listen to us and serve us.

And that is not what many young voters are looking for.“The Republican Party has moved farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, which leaves this huge vacuum, I feel, for younger people who actually want to be a part of a truly progressive movement,” said Hajar Khalid, 20, a student at Columbia University.Ms. Khalid said she supported Medicare for all and would feel somewhat better about voting for Mr. Biden, should he win the nomination, if he had a more comprehensive health care plan or if he chose a truly progressive running mate.“I want to say that despite all of this, I will still vote for the Democratic Party in the general no matter who it is,” she said. “But it’s really hard to say that when the other candidate is Joe Biden, who doesn’t have any real attractive attributes and whose main message seems to be: ‘I won’t change anything to help progressive causes, really, but at least I’m not Trump.’”Beyond the disconnect between young progressives’ ideals and Mr. Biden’s more moderate proposals, there is also a deeper problem: While Mr. Sanders has actively engaged with young people, Mr. Biden has never given much indication that he is seeking their votes at all. At times, he has appeared openly disdainful or condescending toward them.Groups that work with young voters said winning their votes would require speaking more to the policies they want to see enacted, but also considering them in event planning, advertising and communications.

Of course I would. But young voters didn’t turn out in the primaries to support him. That’s our generation’s mistake. We can’t make that same mistake in the general election.”There are many reasons young people are less likely to turn out, ranging from structural obstacles — including voter suppression on college campuses — to disillusionment or distaste for all of the available candidates. But one rationale that came up repeatedly this week was that they did not want to be taken for granted.Democrats assume progressives will vote for them “even as they ignore and dismiss the policy positions most young and progressive voters care about, and yet enough people voted for Jill Stein to lose Hillary the election in multiple key states,” said Sam Anderson, 25, a New Yorker who plans to vote only in down-ballot races unless the party crafts a more progressive platform and Mr. Biden chooses a progressive running mate.“I worry, win or lose, that the party will learn nothing from this election and continue to dismiss the concerns and policy goals of the younger generation they rely upon,” Mr. Anderson said. “The most I can do to influence that at this point is simply not vote and reduce the margin of victory in New York.”Katie Glueck contributed reporting. “It’s going to be up to the campaign to craft messages for young people and develop a really good surrogate program,” said Anne Moses, founder and president of Ignite, which encourages young women to enter politics. “I don’t think Biden is the best person to speak directly to young people.”The lack of political attention is a tremendous source of frustration for young people: both those who are considering not voting because they feel they are being ignored, and those who are angry with their peers for not voting because it perpetuates their exclusion.“Biden and other Democrats would be more receptive to young people if they actually voted,” said Ariel Schwartz, 21, a student at SUNY New Paltz. “Would I like a candidate like Bernie Sanders, who puts young people at the forefront?

"WASHINGTON — Recently, in what amounted to a kind of cosmic Supreme Court hearing, two giant telescope projects pleaded for their lives before a committee charged with charting the future of American astronomy.Either of the telescopes — the Thirty Meter Telescope, slated for the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile — would be roughly three times larger and 10 times more powerful than anything now on Earth. Working in concert, they could tackle deep questions about the cosmos. But they are hundreds of millions of dollars short of the money needed to build them.Failure to build them, American astronomers say, would cede dominion over the skies to Europe, which is building its own behemoth observatory in Chile, and which will be available only to European researchers.

Dr. Mountain is president of American Universities for Research in Astronomy, which manages observatories for the government. To add to the potential pain, he reminded the gathering, the European telescope will be ready in the late 2020s, at least three years before any American counterpart. That timing will allow Europe to draw even more scientific benefit from intervening projects like the James Webb Space Telescope, slated to launch next year, and the Vera Rubin Observatory, a smaller telescope in Chile. These will merely act as “finder-scopes” for the European Extremely Large Telescope, as it is called, Dr. Mountain noted, spotting phenomena that the larger telescope can then investigate and exploit.“They are laying down a gauntlet to the U.S. community,” he said. “How will the U.S. community respond?”The U.S. community was present in the form of a dozen astronomers who were sitting around an open square table that took up most of the conference room. They were the Panel on Optical and Infrared Observatories from the Ground, part of a larger effort known as the Decadal Survey, convened by the National Academy of Sciences every 10 years to set priorities for astronomy and give advice to the government on where to spend money.Tim Heckman, a tall Johns Hopkins astronomer with a shock of white hair who is chair of the panel, sat at one end of the table, leading the questioning.

Dr. Mountain said that for the projects’ staffs, the hearings are like a lobster trap: “They have to get through this if they want to go to the next stage.”This was the first and last chance the astronomers would have to plead their cases in public; the remainder of the year will be given to closed-door meetings and peer-reviewed reports, concluding next year in final recommendations for space- and ground-based astronomy.A blessing by the academy of either or both telescope projects could open the door to money from the National Science Foundation, which has traditionally supported astronomy in the United States, but has yet to contribute to either endeavor.David Charbonneau, a young, bushy-bearded astronomer from Harvard who asked many of the toughest questions, described the discussion as collegial and frank. “The astronomers were as candid as they could be,” he said.Both telescopes are the dream products of cumbersome international collaborations anchored by U.S. universities or observatories. The Thirty Meter Telescope, named for the diameter of its primary light-gathering mirror, is borne of a joint effort of the California Institute of Technology and the University of California. The Giant Magellan would have an effective diameter of 25 meters; it is headquartered in Pasadena near the Carnegie Observatories, one of the founding members of the collaboration. By comparison, the upcoming European telescope is 39 meters in diameter, roughly the size of a basketball court.The Thirty Meter Telescope, TMT for short, is not popular among some Hawaiians. Upset about the exploitation and degradation of the mountain, they have blocked construction crews from accessing Mauna Kea. The collaboration, now known officially as the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, has threatened to move to an alternate site in the Canary Islands. They haven’t done it yet: Mauna Kea is still a better site, they say.

The testimony provided a rare look at the financial and managerial details of these ambitious projects, revealing that they will be more expensive than advertised over the last 20 years of development and promotion. The Thirty Meter Telescope collaboration has long floated a cost estimate of $1.4 billion. The figures released Tuesday put the cost at about $2.4 billion. The latest price tag for the Giant Magellan is now about $2 billion.Under the deal being promoted by Dr. Mountain and his colleagues, about a third of the cost — $850 million for each telescope — would be provided by the National Science Foundation. As a result, the National Science Foundation would own one-third of the observing time on these telescopes, and would make it available to all American astronomers.“We want people to come together to tackle big questions,” said Patrick McCarthy, director of the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory in Tucson, Ariz. His institution, with Dr. Mountain’s, brokered a deal between the two giant projects, formerly bitter competitors, to join forces as they seek enough money to be born.In his own testimony, Tommaso Treu, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a member of the TMT project, ticked off some of the questions that “the power of 2” — two telescopes — could address: Are we alone? What is the universe made of?Even if the European telescope beats the American telescopes to the sky, plenty of science remains to be done: “They’re not going to clean out astronomy in three years,” Dr. Treu said.

As a result, the National Science Foundation would own one-third of the observing time on these telescopes, and would make it available to all American astronomers.“We want people to come together to tackle big questions,” said Patrick McCarthy, director of the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory in Tucson, Ariz. His institution, with Dr. Mountain’s, brokered a deal between the two giant projects, formerly bitter competitors, to join forces as they seek enough money to be born.In his own testimony, Tommaso Treu, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a member of the TMT project, ticked off some of the questions that “the power of 2” — two telescopes — could address: Are we alone? What is the universe made of?Even if the European telescope beats the American telescopes to the sky, plenty of science remains to be done: “They’re not going to clean out astronomy in three years,” Dr. Treu said. When the discussion began, some panelists questioned whether there was enough money in the proposed operating budget to run the telescopes once they had been built. New telescopes usually need new instruments every few years as astronomers develop sharper and more ambitious ideas about what to do with the light they have so painstakingly collected from afar. Each new tool can cost $50 million or more.“In a platform for innovation, I don’t want to put down an empty plate,” Dr. Charbonneau said.Under questioning, the telescope collaborations also had to admit that they had not raised all the money needed to pay their own shares of the telescopes.“How do we make a plan that closes?” Dr. Heckmann asked.Dr. Charbonneau went on to address one of the elephants in the room: What if the Mauna Kea site was not feasible in the end, and the Thirty Meter observatory had to move to the Canary Islands? Were all the partners in the collaboration, which includes Canada, India, Japan and China in addition to Caltech and the University of California, still committed?Dr. Sanders punted to Edward Stone, executive director of the Thirty Meter collaboration and an astrophysicist at Caltech. “The agreement is for Mauna Kea,” Dr. Stone said quietly. “Each member would have to agree to go to La Palma,” he said.He added, “We’re not there yet.” Some of the partners were already willing to move the telescope, he said, but others wanted to wait and see what happened in Hawaii.

In January, a bill was introduced into both houses of Hawaii’s Legislature that would establish a reconciliation commission to mediate between protesters and the state. Its sponsors hope to “decouple” the dispute of Mauna Kea from broader conflicts over issues such as housing, education, health care and the preservation of Hawaiian culture, which linger from the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893 and its territory’s subsequent annexation by the United States. According to Dr. Stone, “quiet conversations” were being held with state leaders, telescope opponents and astronomers.

If the talks fail, Dr. Stone added, “I’m sure the partners will agree to go to La Palma.”The La Palma site is lower in altitude than Mauna Kea, making it less desirable for observing some types of cosmic infrared radiation, but Dr. Sanders declared that the science they needed could be done from both sites: “Mauna Kea is a better site, and we want to go there.”A final decision, Dr. Sanders added, was a few months away.Dr. Sanders told the panel that he once had been a project scientist for the Superconducting Super Collider, which was canceled by Congress in 1993 and superseded by CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, which in 2012 discovered the long-sought Higgs boson. High-energy physics in the United States has never been the same.“We are definitely second rate,” he said. “I mourn the kinds of things we could have done.”The panelists adjourned without tipping their hands.“Thank you for your frank responses,” Dr. Heckman said in conclusion. “It’s a big challenge.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Friday to drastically speed up coronavirus testing, approving a commercial test that will allow labs around the country to begin processing as many as 4,000 samples a day, and introducing an emergency hotline for laboratories.The Food and Drug Administration enlisted Roche, a Swiss health care giant, in the testing effort, giving the global drug manufacturer emergency permission to sell to labs the first commercially approved test for the coronavirus in the United States. That should help expand the scope and speed of coronavirus screening.And the administration announced new partnerships with companies developing tests that can detect the virus within an hour. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Friday to drastically speed up coronavirus testing, approving a commercial test that will allow labs around the country to begin processing as many as 4,000 samples a day, and introducing an emergency hotline for laboratories.The Food and Drug Administration enlisted Roche, a Swiss health care giant, in the testing effort, giving the global drug manufacturer emergency permission to sell to labs the first commercially approved test for the coronavirus in the United States. That should help expand the scope and speed of coronavirus screening.And the administration announced new partnerships with companies developing tests that can detect the virus within an hour. Combined, the moves signaled the federal government was rushing to catch up with overwhelming demand for more testing capacity, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbed and hospitals began to be stretched thin by surges in patients. As of Friday morning, there were at least 1,739 cases of coronavirus confirmed by lab tests and 41 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The global death toll neared 5,100. Combined, the moves signaled the federal government was rushing to catch up with overwhelming demand for more testing capacity, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbed and hospitals began to be stretched thin by surges in patients. As of Friday morning, there were at least 1,739 cases of coronavirus confirmed by lab tests and 41 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The global death toll neared 5,100. The approval of the Roche test means that labs that already have the company’s high-capacity testing equipment — which are available in more than 110 labs in the United States, as well as around the world — will quickly be able to test for the virus. Roche said its commercial test will provide results in three and a half hours. One of its systems, the cobas 8800 System, will be able to test 4,128 samples in 24 hours. Another, the cobas 6800 System, can run 1,440 tests in 24 hours.The F.D.A. has been criticized by lab directors and public health officials for moving too slowly to allow outside companies and academic labs to develop their own tests for the virus, even as other countries, such as South Korea, have quickly ramped up their testing.

“These actions today show our commitment to working around the clock to help expedite the availability of tests,” said Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, in a statement.Dr. Bala N. Hota, an associate chief medical officer at Rush University in Chicago who is overseeing the hospital system’s response to coronavirus, praised the moves.  He said the country’s capacity to test is now so limited that only patients who meet narrow criteria can be tested. But as infections spread through communities, broader testing is needed. “To have that happen, you need the volume, and you need the scale at the lab level,” he said.Dr. Alexander L. Greninger, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak, said his lab has already been talking to Roche about expanding its capacity and was obtaining the equipment needed to begin using the commercial test. The Washington lab is testing about 1,500 patients a day, and the Roche approval will significantly expand that. Dr. Greninger estimated that labs could begin using the Roche tests in about a week.In an interview,  Dr. Thomas Schinecker, chief executive of Roche Diagnostics, said developing such a test normally takes years. Several other testing companies, including Hologic and Cepheid, have also said they were developing commercial tests for the virus.With the approval, he said, “we can really do a lot more testing in a much shorter period of time.” The company has been installing new equipment around the country in anticipation of the F.D.A. approval, and Dr. Schinecker said that all of the major American testing companies already have the Roche testing systems.Under pressure from Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the F.D.A. also on Friday granted New York State’s public health department the authority to allow other labs in the state to conduct tests, without having to go through the federal agency.The F.D.A. said a 24-hour emergency hotline would be created to help private and academic labs process and validate tests, and President Trump announced that he would hold a 3 p.m. news conference to discuss his administration’s response to the virus.The news of Roche’s participation came as the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would award over a million dollars to two other companies, DiaSorin Molecular and Qiagen, to speed up the development of one-hour tests. The tests mark a potentially significant overhaul of the current federal diagnostic model, which requires swabs from patients be sent to laboratories for testing. That takes hours at a minimum.

"BEIJING — China is pushing a new theory about the origins of the coronavirus: It is an American disease that might have been introduced by members of the United States Army who visited Wuhan in October.There is not a shred of evidence to support that, but the notion received an official endorsement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose spokesman accused American officials of not coming clean about what they know about the disease.The intentional spreading of an unfounded conspiracy theory — which recirculated on China’s tightly controlled internet on Friday — punctuated a downward spiral in relations between the two countries that has been fueled by the basest instinct of officials on both sides.The insinuation came in a series of posts on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman who has made good use of the platform, which is blocked in China, to push a newly aggressive, and hawkish, diplomatic strategy. It is most likely intended to deflect attention from China’s own missteps in the early weeks of the epidemic by sowing confusion or, at least, uncertainty at home and abroad.

Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California at San Diego who studies Chinese politics, said that while the campaign was very likely an attempt to distract and deflect blame, a more worrisome possibility was that some officials fabricated the idea and persuaded top leaders to believe it.“If the leadership really believes in the culpability of the U.S. government,” he warned, “it may behave in a way that dramatically worsens the bilateral relationship.”China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has faced sharp criticism for the government’s initial handling of the outbreak, even at home. Public anger erupted in February when a doctor who was punished for warning his colleagues about the coronavirus died, prompting censors to redouble their efforts to stifle public criticism. The old tactic has been amplified by more combative public diplomacy and a new embrace of a social media platform that is blocked in China to spread a message abroad.

Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California at San Diego who studies Chinese politics, said that while the campaign was very likely an attempt to distract and deflect blame, a more worrisome possibility was that some officials fabricated the idea and persuaded top leaders to believe it.“If the leadership really believes in the culpability of the U.S. government,” he warned, “it may behave in a way that dramatically worsens the bilateral relationship.”China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has faced sharp criticism for the government’s initial handling of the outbreak, even at home. Public anger erupted in February when a doctor who was punished for warning his colleagues about the coronavirus died, prompting censors to redouble their efforts to stifle public criticism. Chinese officials have repeatedly urged officials in other countries not to politicize what is a public health emergency. Conservatives in the United States, in particular, have latched on to loaded terms that have been criticized for stigmatizing the Chinese people. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the “Wuhan virus,” while Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, called it the “Chinese coronavirus.” Chinese officials have repeatedly urged officials in other countries not to politicize what is a public health emergency. Conservatives in the United States, in particular, have latched on to loaded terms that have been criticized for stigmatizing the Chinese people. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the “Wuhan virus,” while Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, called it the “Chinese coronavirus.” In response, Chinese officials and state news media have stepped up their criticism of American officials’ comments.Only days before Mr. Zhao’s latest post, the Xinhua news agency published a commentary denouncing “Washington’s poisonous coronavirus politics” and warning that spreading rumors simply encouraged “fear, division and hate.”“Their dangerously irresponsible statements are highly counterproductive at this drastic hour that demands solidarity and cooperation,” the commentary, written by Gao Wencheng, said, “and could be much more menacing than the virus itself.”The coronavirus, according to all evidence, emanated from Wuhan, China, in late December. Scientists have not yet identified a “patient zero” or a precise source of the virus, though preliminary studies have linked it to a virus in bats that passed through another mammal before infecting humans.A senior official of China’s National Health Commission, Liang Wannian, said at a briefing in Beijing last month that the likely carrier was a pangolin, an endangered species that is trafficked almost exclusively to China for its meat and for its scales, which are prized for use in traditional medicine.The first cluster of patients was reported at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and studies have since suggested that the virus could have been introduced there by someone already infected. Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei account for the overwhelming amount of cases and deaths, so there is no scientific reason to believe the virus began elsewhere.Mr. Zhao’s assertion began with a post linking to a video of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert R. Redfield, testifying before the House on Wednesday and suggesting that some flu deaths might have been caused by the coronavirus.

What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your date! US owe us an explanation.”Mr. Zhao appeared to refer to the Military World Games, which were held in Wuhan in October. The Pentagon sent 17 teams with more than 280 athletes and other staff members to the event, well before any reported outbreaks. The Pentagon has had confirmed cases in South Korea and Italy and is bracing for more to emerge, but no illnesses have been tied to American service members from October.Mr. Zhao’s remarks were spread on China’s most prominent social media platform, Weibo, under a hashtag: #ZhaoLijianPostedFiveTweetsinaRowQuestioningAmerica. By late afternoon on Friday, that hashtag had been viewed more than 160 million times, along with screenshots of the original Twitter posts.At the regular briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday, another spokesman, Geng Shuang, sidestepped three questions about whether Mr. Zhao’s suggestion had politicized the crisis and reflected official Chinese policy.He instead noted the statements made by American officials and lawmakers to “smear and attack” China.“We are firmly opposed to this,” he said. “In fact, the international community, including the United States at home, have different views on the source of the virus. What I have been saying in recent days is that the Chinese side always believed that this is a scientific issue and requires scientific and professional opinions.”Claire Fu contributed research. “When did patient zero begin in US?” Mr. Zhao wrote on Twitter, first in English and separately in Chinese. “How many people are infected.

Sanders declared that the crisis “is on a scale of a major war” and argued that “we must act accordingly.” Biden faulted the president’s “adversarial relationship with the truth” and outlined his own multipronged plan for confronting the crisis. He proposed expanding access to free virus testing, helping to increase hospital capacity and speeding up the push for a vaccine.The pandemic has the potential to damage Trump in more than one way. First of all, even as his approval ratings have remained underwater, perceptions that Trump is a strong leader have offered him some safe harbor. Gallup regularly asks Americans for their opinions of the president on a range of personal qualities; the strength of his leadership is the only one on which he consistently receives positive marks.And with the virus sending the stock market into free fall, the country’s thriving economy could soon find itself in a recession. Trump generally gets a positive review from most Americans for his handling of the economy; if the economic picture were to go dark, he could be deprived of one of his major talking points as the 2020 campaign revs up.Trump is working with Congress to craft legislation that will confront both the virus’s economic fallout and national health concerns.

A Brazilian official tested positive soon after meeting last week at Mar-a-Lago with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. That official was part of a delegation led by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was subsequently tested and is awaiting his results.

Michigan’s results were great for Biden — and maybe ominous signs for Trump. No state serves as a better metaphor for the 2016 election than Michigan.Long considered a safe Democratic stronghold, it broke for Trump by just 10,000 votes, contributing to Hillary Clinton’s Electoral College defeat. Clinton underperformed in a range of crucial areas, including with rural voters — who broke for Trump — and African-Americans, who went heavily for Clinton, as expected, but turned out in relatively low numbers. Biden’s win in the Michigan primary this week suggests that something quite different could be in store come November. In what ended up being a warning sign of things to come, Clinton narrowly lost the 2016 Democratic primary there to Sanders. But on Tuesday, Biden trounced Sanders and drew strong support from a broad coalition of voters, including college-educated white women, moderates and those over 45. Staff members are expected to work through the night on the final language of the bill and provisions related to family and medical leave.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday over the coronavirus pandemic and announced steps he said would speed the availability of testing, and early Saturday, the House passed a bill reflecting a deal with his administration to provide billions of dollars to help sick workers and to prop up a slumping economy.Markets rallied on Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration, which he said would free up $50 billion for states and localities to cope with the outbreak — separate from the congressional relief measure — and which would allow the Treasury Department to delay tax filing deadlines for some individuals and businesses.During a news conference in the Rose Garden, the president also said he would indefinitely suspend interest collections on federal student loans, although no bills would go down. And he instructed the Energy Department to buy enough oil to fill the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve “to the top.”The S&P 500 soared during the remarks and closed the day up by more than 9 percent.At the news conference, Mr. Trump followed none of the safety protocols recommended to combat the spread of the virus, shaking hands with multiple administration officials and chief executives and sharing a microphone with them.

He said his plan would speed the ability of Americans to be tested for the virus. It includes private partnerships to speed tests to the market and a website designed by Google, where Mr. Trump said potential patients could enter their symptoms and be directed to a drive-through testing center. The president said the site would be available starting on Sunday, with the goal of allowing all Americans who needed a test to get one “very safely, quickly and conveniently.” He said his plan would speed the ability of Americans to be tested for the virus.

The president said the site would be available starting on Sunday, with the goal of allowing all Americans who needed a test to get one “very safely, quickly and conveniently.” But later, Google appeared to cast doubt on when or even whether that would be possible. A spokeswoman said that the initiative was in its “early stages” and would first be introduced as a prototype in the Bay Area.The president, who has claimed that anyone who wanted a test could get one, also deflected any blame for the testing delays that have hampered the government’s response.“I don’t take responsibility at all,” Mr. Trump said.He brushed off questions about his own possible exposure to the virus. A Brazilian official who visited him last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has since tested positive, but Mr. Trump said he had no symptoms and did not need to be tested. When repeatedly pressed on the matter, he said he was likely to be screened. “Fairly soon,” he said. “We’re working out a schedule.” But later, Google appeared to cast doubt on when or even whether that would be possible.

Conley, said testing was “not currently indicated.”The relief deal, whose cost is unclear, would allow for two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave for those affected by the crisis.It provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit. It does not include the payroll tax suspension that Mr. Trump wants. Any such suspension could cost more than $800 billion and would not provide help to workers who lose their jobs or stop drawing salaries in the outbreak.

“We could have passed our bill yesterday,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “But we thought it would be important to show the American people — to assure the American people — that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them.”The announcements came as the pandemic’s ripple effects further slowed critical sectors of the American economy and interfered with daily life.Schools across the country, including in Los Angeles and the entire state of Virginia, shut down. Delta Air Lines announced it would ground 300 aircraft and reduce capacity by 40 percent, the sharpest cutback in its history. Grocery store shelves were picked clean, and restaurants and retail stores braced for fall-offs in customer traffic as more Americans began to follow “social distancing” orders to avoid crowds and possible virus transmission.The House voted overwhelmingly to approve the aid bill, which was unveiled minutes before midnight and passed 363 to 40 at 12:53 a.m. Saturday. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, the chamber’s lone independent, voted present.The bill includes enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing and additional funds for food assistance and Medicaid. Senators, who left Washington for the weekend on Thursday, are expected to take up the measure when they return next week. Mr. Trump has signed off on it. Yet around midnight, his physician, Sean P.

Senators, who left Washington for the weekend on Thursday, are expected to take up the measure when they return next week. Mr. Trump has signed off on it. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in a statement after the vote that “senators will need to carefully review” the bill passed by the House.“But I believe the vast majority of senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers, families and small businesses,” he said.

The shape of the paid leave benefit — and how many workers could have access to it — proved to be a sticking point in negotiations on Friday between Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Democrats agreed to drop a provision that would have created a permanent paid sick leave entitlement in case of a public health emergency. Republicans sought to confine it only to people who were sick or caring for ill family or children kept out of school.Ms. Pelosi characterized the bill on Friday evening as an intermediate step.“As the Senate works to pass this bill,” she wrote in a letter to colleagues, “the House will begin work on a third emergency response package to protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.”In Europe, officials announced a series of aggressive measures to support their economies and try to contain the virus’s spread.

Mr. Trump’s moves and the aid bill was considered progress in the effort to slow the virus’s spread and minimize damage to the economy.But they still fell far short of the steps that many economists say lawmakers must take to confront a crisis with little precedent in American history — one that is likely to require Mr. Trump to marshal a rapid bipartisan response.His difficulty in doing so was evident on Friday. Shortly after stock trading closed for the day, the president cast doubt on the aid package that had been negotiated painstakingly by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin.

Shortly after stock trading closed for the day, the president cast doubt on the aid package that had been negotiated painstakingly by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin. “We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough” in negotiations, he said. (Ms. Pelosi, asked why she didn’t speak to Mr. Trump about the bill, said that “there was no need for that.”)A senior administration official said that the president was referring to the $1 trillion temporary cut in payroll taxes, an idea that lawmakers from both parties have viewed with skepticism. “We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough” in negotiations, he said.

Still, talks continued as the afternoon progressed. As Mr. Trump was criticizing Democrats, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin were speaking for the 10th time of the day about the legislation. Ms. Pelosi announced the deal after they concluded their 13th call, and shortly after Mr. Mnuchin met privately with the president to urge him to accept it.In the hours after that, the deal seemed in peril as White House officials insisted they were still reviewing text and aides rushed to make technical changes.“Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” Mr. Trump tweeted just before 9 p.m., giving the first indication that he backed the measure and wanted Republicans to vote for it.Any delay could further imperil an economy that many forecasters are persuaded is entering a recession, caused by the damage the virus has already inflicted on global supply chains and the growing chill from homebound consumers pulling back on their spending.

Some economists say that to contain the spread of the virus, the country must effectively hit pause on entire sectors of commerce, like entertainment and dining, that bring Americans together in large crowds. Those economists say Congress and Mr. Trump must help workers and small-business owners weather that shock — and give them enough cash to help kick-start spending and hiring again once the virus is contained and daily routines begin to return to normal.“The approach has to be, let’s make this as short and sharp as we can,” said Steven Hamilton, an economist at George Washington University who has recently called for policymakers to rethink traditional government stimulus efforts that focus largely on tax cuts or spending programs, and instead supply hundreds of billions of dollars in direct assistance to workers and small business owners.

The United States economy is going to need to shut — I mean, shut everything — for two to six weeks.”That sort of abrupt halt in activity will particularly hurt small-business owners who lack the cash reserves or access to credit that larger companies enjoy. It will also slam lower-income workers, many of whom do not have paid leave, or work in industries like hospitality that are suffering acutely from the pandemic — or both.By limiting the number of people gathering in common spaces, traveling by public transit systems, and coming into direct contact with one another, it may be possible to substantially slow the spread of the virus, experts say.Studies of cities and states that have required employers to offer paid sick leave show substantially lower rates of influenza during flu season, a sign that the provision does reduce the spread of illness. Many economists, including conservatives and liberals, applauded the inclusion of a paid leave provision in the House bill.“Good economic policy starts by ensuring that the humans in the economy stay well — and alive — so they can participate in the economy as both producers and consumers,” said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality and growth. “We need to focus on this basic first principle right now.” “It’s the worst public health crisis in a century,” Mr. Hamilton said. “The world has never faced anything like this.

Mr. Trump sent mixed messages in his news conference about the size of the economic impact he was expecting, and about the steps Americans should take to avoid contracting or transmitting the virus.He called upon Americans to make “short-term sacrifices” like avoiding large gatherings and postponing business travel, and he warned that the next eight weeks would be critical for slowing the spread of the virus.“This will pass through,” Mr. Trump said, “and we’re going to be even stronger for it.”Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Nicholas Fandos, Maggie Haberman, Margot Sanger-Katz, Jeanna Smialek, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Alan Rappeport.

"As he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump attempted to deflect criticisms of his administration’s response to the virus with inaccurate claims. Here’s a fact-check.what the facts areMr. Trump wrongly blamed the Obama administration for coronavirus testing shortages and falsely said it “didn’t do testing” during the swine flu epidemic of 2009.What Mr. Trump Said“I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time.”False. The Food and Drug Administration issued a “draft guidance” in 2014 in which it sought to extend its authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests. But it’s wrong to blame that effort for the scattered and insufficient delivery of coronavirus tests as the guidance was not particularly relevant to emergency situations and was never finalized or generally enforced.A law enacted in 2004 created the process and requirements for the use of unapproved products in public health emergencies. Under the law and guidance set by the Trump administration itself, the Food and Drug Administration requires developers of laboratory-developed tests to submit information and to comply with certain procedures.

This is blatantly wrong. Diagnostic tests for the swine flu were approved and shipped out less than two weeks after the H1N1 virus was identified and a day before the first death in the United States.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the first case of the virus on April 14, 2009. The Obama administration declared swine flu a public health emergency on April 26. The Food and Drug Administration approved a rapid test for the virus two days later. At the time, the C.D.C. had reported 64 cases and zero deaths. The C.D.C. began shipping test kits to public health laboratories on May 1 (at 141 cases and one death) and a second test was approved in July. From May to September 2009, the agency shipped more than 1,000 kits, each one able to test 1,000 specimens.To be sure, researchers found flaws and limitations in the tests but testing was conducted. A vaccine became available in early October but, amid reports of shortages, President Obama declared the outbreak a national emergency later that month. The estimated death toll in the United States from the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010. The agency said in early March that it would permit unapproved tests for the coronavirus for 15 days while developers are preparing their emergency authorization request. Neither the 2004 law nor subsequent amendments restricted the Trump administration from doing so, nor did it hamper previous administrations in fast-tracking testing for other health crises.What Mr. Trump Said“If you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the first case of the virus on April 14, 2009. The Obama administration declared swine flu a public health emergency on April 26. The Food and Drug Administration approved a rapid test for the virus two days later. At the time, the C.D.C. had reported 64 cases and zero deaths. The C.D.C. began shipping test kits to public health laboratories on May 1 (at 141 cases and one death) and a second test was approved in July. From May to September 2009, the agency shipped more than 1,000 kits, each one able to test 1,000 specimens.To be sure, researchers found flaws and limitations in the tests but testing was conducted. A vaccine became available in early October but, amid reports of shortages, President Obama declared the outbreak a national emergency later that month. The estimated death toll in the United States from the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010. What the Facts AreMr. Trump inaccurately described a website in development to mitigate the outbreak.What Mr. Trump Said“I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website, it’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”This is misleading. Mr. Trump misstated the company developing the website and exaggerated its scope. After Mr. Trump spoke, Google issued a statement on Twitter from Verily, a separate subsidiary of Google’s parent company.“We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,” the statement read.A spokeswoman for Verily said it had originally intended for the website to be used only by health care workers. Mr. Trump’s statement prompted the company to make it available to the public. The site will direct people to “pilot sites” for testing in the Bay Area, the spokeswoman said. If the pilot goes well, Verily aims to deploy the project nationwide, but there is no timetable for a national rollout.what the facts areMr. Trump again mischaracterized travel restrictions imposed on certain European countries.What Mr. Trump Said“As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now and we closed that border a while ago.”This is misleading. Mr. Trump imposed some travel restrictions on 26 European countries on Wednesday night, but those restrictions do not go into effect until midnight on Friday and do not amount to a total shutting down of the border.The restrictions bar the entry of foreign nationals who have been to any of the 26 countries that make up Europe’s Schengen Area of open borders within 14 days. That area does not include more than 20 other European countries, including Britain. The proclamation also does not apply to American citizens, permanent residents, their immediate families, or those who are members of air or sea crews.

The proclamation also does not apply to American citizens, permanent residents, their immediate families, or those who are members of air or sea crews. what the facts areMr. Trump described telemedicine technology as “fairly new,” though it’s been used for decades.What Mr. Trump Said“This includes the following critical authorities — the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that has happened in the not-so-distant past.”This is exaggerated. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded access to telehealth services — for example, virtual check-ins and telephone consultations with doctors — for Medicare beneficiaries this week. But these technologies have been in use since the 1960s.The University of Nebraska used video links to provide exams and diagnoses with a state hospital 112 miles in 1964. Three years later, the University of Miami and a local fire department transmitted cardiac rhythms using radio channels. Federal agencies initiated a host of other services in the 1970s and 1980s.A 1997 government report noted a severely injured sailor aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln was able to be treated by a doctor in San Diego 6,000 miles away through telemedicine. By 2014, “more than 20 federal agencies were engaged in some aspect of telehealth,” according to the Congressional Research Service, with the Department of Veterans Affairs providing more than 2.1 million telehealth consultations in the 2015 fiscal year.what the facts areMr. Trump said he was not responsible for disbanding the White House’s pandemic team.what Mr. Trump said“When you say me, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could ask — perhaps my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it.”This is misleading. The top White House official tasked with leading the country’s response to a pandemic left the administration in May 2018 and his team was disbanded by Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at the time, John R. Bolton, The Washington Post has reported.While there is no evidence that Mr. Trump personally directed the ousting of these officials, he also did not replace them in the nearly two years since, despite repeated bipartisan urgings from lawmakers and experts. what the facts areMr. Trump described telemedicine technology as “fairly new,” though it’s been used for decades.What Mr. Trump Said“This includes the following critical authorities — the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that has happened in the not-so-distant past.”This is exaggerated.

What the Facts AreMr. Trump announced his administration would temporarily waive interest on some student loans.What Mr. Trump Said“To help our students and their families, I have waived interest that all student loans held by federal government agencies, and that will be until further notice.”This needs context. Interest rates will be temporarily waived for borrowers, but their monthly payments will not actually decrease, according to a Department of Education spokeswoman. Instead, borrowers’ full payments will go toward the principal on their loans.The waiver also does not cover student loans issued through state agencies, big private lenders, a majority of Federal Family Education Loans or school-held Perkins loans.Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

"WASHINGTON — There was one big question looming on Friday over the Rose Garden, where President Trump held an afternoon news conference and announced new emergency measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.As Mr. Trump introduced a line of chief executives and public health officials, praising their efforts and those of his administration, the mystery was the president’s own health. Would Mr. Trump, 73, be tested after interacting with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after meeting with him in Florida?On an issue that seemed cut and dry, yes or no, Mr. Trump hedged.First he insisted that he did not have any symptoms, and noted that getting tested might set a bad example. “We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test,” he said.Then a reporter questioned whether Mr. Trump was disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the public health official standing directly to his right, who has recommended tests and self-quarantining for anyone who stood next to someone who had tested positive.

In fact, he said, he did plan to get tested “fairly soon,” but not because of his exposure to an infected individual.“Not for that reason,” he said, without providing another reason for the test that until now he appears to have resisted. “I think I will do it anyway. Fairly soon. We’re working out a schedule.”

But hours later, just before midnight, the White House physician released a statement saying Mr. Trump would not be tested — nor would he self-quarantine — even as it became apparent that he had interacted with not one but with at least two infected members of the Brazilian delegation that visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last weekend.Mr. Trump’s interactions with the infected individuals qualified as “LOW risk,” wrote Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, so quarantine was not recommended. He added that because the president continued to show no symptoms of the virus, “testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” Other medical experts have recommended testing for asymptomatic people who could still spread the virus to others. “I think they shouldn’t be jumping to get the test unless it’s necessary, but I think they have to listen to their doctors,” the president said.But when pressed again on the issue, Mr. Trump equivocated.

He added that because the president continued to show no symptoms of the virus, “testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” Other medical experts have recommended testing for asymptomatic people who could still spread the virus to others. Pressure on Mr. Trump to get tested has been growing since he came into contact with Fabio Wajngarten, a top communications aide to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who tested positive days after a visit last weekend to Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. At Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Wajngarten participated in meetings with the president and posed for a photograph with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Two more Brazilian officials who were pictured at an outdoor table with Mr. Trump said Friday night that they had also tested positive for the virus.Senators Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both announced on Thursday plans to self-quarantine because of potential contact with Mr. Wajngarten, and Mr. Bolsonaro was also tested for the virus. He announced Friday that he had tested negative.But Mr. Trump said he was dubious of Mr. Wajngarten’s condition, and on Friday played down his interactions with him. “There was somebody that they say has it,” he said. “I have no idea who he is. I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds.”In one photograph, which Mr. Wajngarten posted on social media, the Brazilian official is standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Trump, who is clutching a brown “Make Brazil Great Again” baseball cap.ImageThe pictured posted by Fabio Wajngarten.Credit...via Associated PressA video from the event also showed Mr. Wajngarten standing directly behind Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro as they addressed a crowd. Dr. Conley conceded in his letter that Mr. Trump had “spent more time in closer proximity” with one of the other dinner guests who later tested positive.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, declined to say whether any members of the president’s family or his administration would undergo testing.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not respond to questions about whether he would submit himself to a coronavirus test. Mr. Trump’s news conference took place on a warm, springlike day, with cherry blossoms blooming, a balmy backdrop that belied the anxiety gripping the nation. Governors across the country had ordered schools to close, and people nationwide had been ordered to work from home indefinitely.At the news conference, Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said nursing homes should temporarily restrict all visitors and nonessential personnel from their facilities.But Mr. Trump and the clutch of aides that stood around him seemed like they were beaming in from a less precarious time and place. For all of the recommendations about social distancing and the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to replace handshakes with elbow taps, the president insisted on shaking hands with the chief executives who joined him on the dais.Behind Mr. Trump, the group huddled closely together, not six feet apart, as guidance suggests.When the chief executive of a medical home visit company offered Mr. Trump the recommended elbow bump instead of his hand, the president chuckled. “I like that,” he said, as if it were the first time he was witnessing the gesture.The news conference, which Mr. Trump announced earlier in the day on Twitter, was something of a do-over, after his Oval Office address on Wednesday evening, which was filled with inaccuracies and was generally seen as a failed opportunity to demonstrate leadership or offer guidance during a time of crisis.On Thursday, advisers planned an announcement that new tests for the coronavirus would be available soon, hoping it would put to bed recriminations about the insufficient availability of test kits that has left health officials largely blind to the virus’s domestic spread. But Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Hope Hicks, a top adviser who recently returned to the White House, were still working with the president on the details of his announcement until curtain time.And the tone quickly shifted when Mr. Trump took questions from reporters.“I don’t take responsibility at all,” the president said when pressed about whether he was responsible for delays in testing. He also claimed to have no knowledge of why, in 2018, his administration dismantled a pandemic response team that was once part of the National Security Council.

I don’t know anything about it.”The president’s defensive responses echoed how he began his day, when he blamed President Barack Obama for a severe shortage in test kits — a charge that did little to rebut critics who say that his administration has moved too slowly to ensure a mass national testing ability.“For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.”The president also pointed to the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States that left more than 12,000 people dead, saying that Mr. Obama had mismanaged it.“Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now,” he continued. “The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!”But Mr. Obama’s acting health secretary declared a public health emergency in April 2009, when only 20 known cases of the virus existed and before anyone in the United States had died of it. Mr. Obama declared a national emergency six months later, after hundreds of fatalities.Former Obama officials said that Mr. Trump was making false charges which, even if true, would not account for his failure to act sooner.“This is a typical Trump move to blame the previous administration,” said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a former White House health policy adviser. “We are now more than three years into his administration. He’s had plenty of time to rectify any problems.

"The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s recent primary victories has obscured an important schism within the Democratic Party: between the older voters who carried Mr. Biden to victory and the younger voters who overwhelmingly rejected him.The dividing line is around age 45, and it is as stark as a flipped switch. In some states on Tuesday, Mr. Biden won two-thirds or more of voters older than 45, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won about two-thirds of voters younger than that.Comparatively low turnout among young voters helped save Mr. Biden in the primaries. But in the general election, a similar lack of turnout could become a huge liability — a point Mr. Sanders made explicitly on Wednesday as he announced that he would continue his campaign at least through the next debate on Sunday.“I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,” Mr. Sanders said. “You must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.” The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s recent primary victories has obscured an important schism within the Democratic Party: between the older voters who carried Mr. Biden to victory and the younger voters who overwhelmingly rejected him.The dividing line is around age 45, and it is as stark as a flipped switch.

Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo on Wednesday that winning in November would depend on bringing young voters in. And Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, said at a fund-raiser in Illinois last week that her husband was talking to his staff about “engaging the youth vote and coming up with some youth advocacy.”But Mr. Biden has been campaigning for nearly a year to represent a party that young voters often prefer, and his lack of support among those voters has been evident for a long time.“What I’m a little nervous that we’re in the middle of right now is a repeat of 2016,” said Sarah Audelo, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, who worked on Hillary Clinton’s campaign and said it did not invest enough in outreach to young voters during the primaries. “What that meant was the campaign had to start from scratch in the general, and that is not something Joe Biden can afford to do.”The New York Times spoke with more than 30 young Democrats from 17 states this week, ranging in age from 17 to 34. Most of them said they had voted for Mr. Sanders or planned to do so if he stayed in the race through their state’s primary. Some had voted for Senator Elizabeth Warren before she dropped out. Only two said they wanted Mr. Biden to be the nominee.And while many said they would reluctantly vote for Mr. Biden in November for the sake of beating President Trump, about a third said they would consider staying home or voting for a third-party candidate unless Mr. Biden made significant concessions to the party’s left wing.

They were well aware of his plans to address climate change, student debt and other issues that matter to them — plans that would help Mr. Biden appeal to young voters, his wife said. But those plans, the young Democrats said, were not the solution to the generational gap among the candidates’ supporters; they were a cause.“The plan the Biden campaign put forward for climate change is nowhere near good enough to save our Earth,” said Benjamin Brumer, 28, who lives in California and said he felt hopeless about his future under either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden. “It will be hard, if not impossible, for them to convince me to vote for Biden. But a good first step toward reconciliation would be to make bolder promises for solving climate change.”Lindsay Huber, 29, who lives in Oregon, said that at an “absolute bare minimum,” to win her vote, Mr. Biden needed to stop accepting super PAC money and endorse both “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal.“And it would still be difficult to trust that he’s being truthful, because he has decades of racist, sexist, corporatist, warmongering votes,” Ms. Huber said. “To win us back, the Democratic Party needs to actually listen to us and serve us. Or else they need to die and we will create a new party ourselves.” They were well aware of his plans to address climate change, student debt and other issues that matter to them — plans that would help Mr. Biden appeal to young voters, his wife said.

And that is not what many young voters are looking for.“The Republican Party has moved farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, which leaves this huge vacuum, I feel, for younger people who actually want to be a part of a truly progressive movement,” said Hajar Khalid, 20, a student at Columbia University.Ms. Khalid said she supported Medicare for all and would feel somewhat better about voting for Mr. Biden, should he win the nomination, if he had a more comprehensive health care plan or if he chose a truly progressive running mate.“I want to say that despite all of this, I will still vote for the Democratic Party in the general no matter who it is,” she said. “But it’s really hard to say that when the other candidate is Joe Biden, who doesn’t have any real attractive attributes and whose main message seems to be: ‘I won’t change anything to help progressive causes, really, but at least I’m not Trump.’”Beyond the disconnect between young progressives’ ideals and Mr. Biden’s more moderate proposals, there is also a deeper problem: While Mr. Sanders has actively engaged with young people, Mr. Biden has never given much indication that he is seeking their votes at all. At times, he has appeared openly disdainful or condescending toward them.Groups that work with young voters said winning their votes would require speaking more to the policies they want to see enacted, but also considering them in event planning, advertising and communications.

Of course I would. But young voters didn’t turn out in the primaries to support him. That’s our generation’s mistake. We can’t make that same mistake in the general election.”There are many reasons young people are less likely to turn out, ranging from structural obstacles — including voter suppression on college campuses — to disillusionment or distaste for all of the available candidates. But one rationale that came up repeatedly this week was that they did not want to be taken for granted.Democrats assume progressives will vote for them “even as they ignore and dismiss the policy positions most young and progressive voters care about, and yet enough people voted for Jill Stein to lose Hillary the election in multiple key states,” said Sam Anderson, 25, a New Yorker who plans to vote only in down-ballot races unless the party crafts a more progressive platform and Mr. Biden chooses a progressive running mate.“I worry, win or lose, that the party will learn nothing from this election and continue to dismiss the concerns and policy goals of the younger generation they rely upon,” Mr. Anderson said. “The most I can do to influence that at this point is simply not vote and reduce the margin of victory in New York.”Katie Glueck contributed reporting. “It’s going to be up to the campaign to craft messages for young people and develop a really good surrogate program,” said Anne Moses, founder and president of Ignite, which encourages young women to enter politics. “I don’t think Biden is the best person to speak directly to young people.”The lack of political attention is a tremendous source of frustration for young people: both those who are considering not voting because they feel they are being ignored, and those who are angry with their peers for not voting because it perpetuates their exclusion.“Biden and other Democrats would be more receptive to young people if they actually voted,” said Ariel Schwartz, 21, a student at SUNY New Paltz. “Would I like a candidate like Bernie Sanders, who puts young people at the forefront?

According to prepared remarks circulated by the campaign, Mr. Biden began the town hall event by discussing the virus, detailing his vision for fighting it and praising the deal reached between the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the White House on a coronavirus relief package. He was also joined at the virtual town hall by Vivek Murthy, the former United States surgeon general who is part of Mr. Biden’s public health advisory committee.“We will overcome this moment,” the prepared remarks for Mr. Biden said. “That will require all of us to be prudent and proactive.

He said the campaign would rely “more on our internet capabilities.”Mr. Sanders said that he too, had not been tested for the coronavirus because he had not presented any symptoms and had not, to his knowledge, come in contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus.

"One night this week an urgent appeal went out to a Facebook group of emergency room doctors. “If you were in charge of the Federal response to the Pandemic what would your recommendations be?” asked Dr. Kurt Kloss, a physician based in New York.The question was hardly theoretical. “I have direct channel,” he added, “to person now in charge at White House and have been asked for recommendations.”That person, he said, is Jared Kushner, a top adviser to President Trump who has become increasingly involved in the administration’s response to the coronavirus and is also the brother-in-law of the doctor’s daughter, the model Karlie Kloss. Ms. Kloss is married to Joshua Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s brother and a venture capitalist who in 2012 helped found a start-up insurer called Oscar Health.“Tonight I was asked by Jared through my son-in-law for my recommendations,” Dr. Kloss wrote on Wednesday evening. “That’s when I turned to you guys my fellow BAFERDs for help.” BAFERD is an acronym for emergency room doctors, joined by a number of expletives.

Among the laundry list of suggestions Dr. Kloss listed on his personal page were ideas like nationalizing testing devices “as in wartime,” activating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, creating pop-up field hospitals and canceling mass gatherings, according to the post.Other ideas included using emergency funding to compensate those who were quarantined, and “draconian” travel restrictions. Screenings, Dr. Kloss mused, could be done over telemedecine-based video services.In recent days, Jared Kushner has assumed large portions of the portfolio managing the coronavirus crisis and by Dr. Kloss’s account, was highly interested in the doctors’ recommendations.In a series of follow-up posts on Wednesday evening, Dr. Kloss posted updates to the Facebook group, which includes more than 20,000 medical professionals. “Jared is reading now,” one message said.Dr. Kloss ended the post with the phrase “got to turn this in now,” though a series of commenters who apparently knew his connection to the Trump administration urged him to send the list of ideas to the president.

Messages to Dr. Kloss went unanswered.The Spectator earlier reported news of the Facebook group.Turning to Dr. Kloss is not entirely without merit. A graduate of the University of Miami medical school, he is an emergency medicine specialist who has practiced for more than 30 years.But Dr. Kloss is also outside the purview of the government, where officials have struggled to get on the same page. By midday Friday, news of Dr. Kloss’s crowdsourced knowledge gathering had hit the internet.The exchange alarmed at least some of the doctors in the group, according to a person who viewed the discussion. The only requirement to be let into the private Facebook group was showing the administrator proof of practicing medicine; anyone part of the group could comment on or view the exchange.One person described the group as “far from a group of experts,” but more a “collection of rando doctors on social media.”The Facebook post was deleted from Dr. Kloss’s page later Thursday evening, after reporters inquired about the matter.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Maggie Haberman from New York. “Send it to TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!!” one commenter wrote, followed by more than a dozen exclamation points and three bicep emojis. “Done,” Mr. Kloss responded.A person close to Mr. Kushner said he was unaware of Dr. Kloss’s activities and a White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

"WASHINGTON — The entire federal appeals court in Washington said on Friday that it would take up two cases that raised the question of whether and when Congress may sue to resolve a dispute with the president, setting up a double-barreled test for establishing when the judicial branch can resolve disputes over separation of powers.In a terse order, the full appeals court said it would rehear a case involving a House Judiciary Committee subpoena to Donald F. McGahn II, President Trump’s former White House counsel, vacating a 2-1 panel ruling last month that Congress could not sue to enforce its subpoenas of executive branch officials.The full court also said it would immediately take up a case that House Democrats brought against Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin challenging the administration’s use of emergency powers and other extraordinary measures to spend more taxpayer funds on Mr. Trump’s border wall with Mexico than Congress had been willing to appropriate.In the border wall case, a United States District Court judge had sided with Mr. Trump and dismissed the case, saying the House had no standing to bring it. An appeals court panel heard arguments in the case weeks ago but has not yet issued a ruling. The order said that the panel had requested that the full court hear that case since it also raised an issue of standing.

The full Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear arguments in both cases on April 28.The cases raise major issues about the scope of the power of Congress to enlist the courts’ aid when lawmakers believe a president is illegally spending funds — defying its constitutional power of the purse — or instructing an aide to illegally ignore a subpoena, defying its constitutional power to conduct oversight of the government.The McGahn subpoena case is particularly important because it could have far-reaching consequences for executive branch secrecy powers long after Mr. Trump leaves office. The now-vacated panel ruling dealt a severe blow to Congress’s ability to conduct oversight when a president is willing to simply stonewall “all” subpoenas, as Mr. Trump has vowed to do.Mr. McGahn was a key witness in the second volume of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, about Mr. Trump’s efforts to obstruct the Russia inquiry. The House wanted to question Mr. McGahn about the same topic.But on Mr. Trump’s instructions, Mr. McGahn defied the House subpoena.

But litigants who lose at the panel level can choose to appeal to the entire body to have the case reheard. That can be important when the ideological balance between the three-judge panel and the full court is different.The scope of Congress’s power to conduct oversight and seek judicial redress in disputes with the president has no fixed partisan implications; both major parties trade control of both branches, so sometimes a Republican Congress will be battling a Democratic president.But so far, both cases have followed a pattern at both the district and appellate levels. Every judge who sided with Mr. Trump was a Republican appointee, and every judge who sided with Congress was a Democratic appointee. (In similar cases in the past, however, district court judges have sided against presidents of the same party of the president who appointed them.)Notably, the partisan balance on the full appeals court cuts the other way: Seven of the 11 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents.Still, should the full appeals court determine that the House does have standing to bring the lawsuit and order Mr. McGahn to testify, the Justice Department could again appeal to the Supreme Court. There, five of the nine justices are conservative Republican appointees.Depending on how long the case takes to resolve, the presidential election may take place in the interim.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday signed an emergency declaration over the coronavirus pandemic, unlocking certain government powers to deal with the public health challenge. Here’s a breakdown of what that means on a legal and practical level.What is emergency power?It’s special authority that a president can unlock and use in exigent circumstances.Congress has enacted more than 100 laws that permit a president to declare that emergencies exist, freeing the government from abiding by some of its usual legal constraints. This flexibility can include permitting the federal government to spend additional funds, including to aid state and local governments, and temporarily lowering legal barriers to certain actions.In some cases, an umbrella law called the National Emergencies Act that regulates how presidents can use exigent power must be invoked to use another, setting up a complex cascade of effects. In public health, emergency power laws include provisions of the Public Health Service Act, the Stafford Act, the Social Security Act and other statutes.How does a Stafford Act emergency work?It frees up federal funds and other resources to help when “federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety.” WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday signed an emergency declaration over the coronavirus pandemic, unlocking certain government powers to deal with the public health challenge.

If a president grants a declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can coordinate a response. The act also empowers the president to direct any federal agency to use its personnel, facilities and equipment to support state and local emergency efforts, disseminate public health and safety information, provide public health and safety measures, and distribute supplies like medicine and food.While the Stafford Act is more often activated in cases of major disasters that cause property damage, like hurricanes and floods, it has also been used in public health emergencies. In 2000, President Bill Clinton used it to cover mosquito control operations in New Jersey and New York during the outbreak of the West Nile virus.Wasn’t there already an emergency determination?Yes, but it was under a less sweeping law.On Jan. 31, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of Health and Human Services, determined that an emergency existed under the Public Health Service Act. The determination made it easier for state and local health departments to temporarily reassign personnel whose salaries were funded through federal public health programs, freeing them from regular duties to help respond to the pandemic.What about the Social Security Act?Mr. Trump’s move will also unlock extra powers under Section 1135 of the Social Security Act aimed at making it easier to get medical supplies and doctors and nurses where they are needed most.

"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department this week hosted training for its lawyers on religious liberty laws as part of Attorney General William P. Barr’s push to prioritize religious freedom cases, but the workshops prompted concern among some career lawyers that they were being educated on ways to blunt civil rights protections for gay and transgender people.Lawyers who worked at the Justice Department during the past three administrations could not recall a similar week of training sessions on any topic.The training week was part of an ongoing campaign at the department to bolster ​its work to​ protect religious freedom, which is regularly described by top leaders as the first right protected by the First Amendment​, a department official said in response to a request for comment. ​In an email to employees sent on behalf of department leaders last weekend about the training, the department said that its leaders were proud of the work “done over the past year to promote religious freedom,” including prosecutions related to land use, education and employment.

Last month, the department filed a statement of interest in federal court in Kentucky that supported the right of a photographer not to work at same-sex weddings; she said it would violate her religious beliefs. And last fall the Justice Department supported an appeals case in Maine, saying that a state law banning religious schools from the state’s school tuition program was unconstitutional.Both filings were a departure from the department’s positions under the Obama administration and have drawn criticism from gay rights activists as well as supporters of a sharp separation between church and state.The training, the first of its kind, was voluntary. It was meant to improve employees’ understanding of their own free exercise ​of religious ​rights in the workplace​, as well as the department’s ​resources for protecting places of worship and individual religious rights, according to the department official.But career lawyers said that they feared the department was working to further the use of religious freedom in ways that would push back efforts to protect gay and transgender people from discrimination, according to emails and messages reviewed by The New York Times.Some lawyers cited the department’s support of the photographer in Kentucky and its support of a Colorado baker whose refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple was upheld by the Supreme Court. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a Justice Department event to celebrate religious freedom that the baker, Jack Phillips, was courageous and that Western culture was increasingly “less hospitable to people of faith.” Last month, the department filed a statement of interest in federal court in Kentucky that supported the right of a photographer not to work at same-sex weddings; she said it would violate her religious beliefs.

In January, Mr. Barr also met with Jewish leaders in Brooklyn to discuss a nationwide rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes. Prosecutors also secured a guilty plea from a Louisiana man charged with intentionally setting fire to three black Baptist churches in violation of the Church Arson Prevention Act.The training sessions focused on topics including protections for religious land use, the religious rights of prisoners, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, protecting places of worship, and the religious liberty rights of employees under federal law.“Religious liberty is a core American value and a top priority for the department,” the department said in the email about the training.“We pledge to protect the free exercise of religion when we take our oath to ‘support and defend the Constitution.’ We do so out of respect for the conscience of our fellow citizens and to preserve the civil society in which our liberal democracy can flourish.”The email echoes remarks that Mr. Barr made last month at the National Religious Broadcasters’ annual convention, where he said that “Augustinian Christianity” is at the root of the our democracy, and that Americans “providentially enjoy its blessings today.” Vanita Gupta, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the former head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, accused Mr. Barr of using the Justice Department to promote his religious beliefs.“In speeches and statements, he says that civil society is being undermined by a move away from religiosity,” she said. “He wants to use civil rights statutes and the D.O.J. to redeem what he views as the corrupted soul of America.”The department’s civil rights division has also undertaken work more in keeping with past administrations.

"“Today I’d like to provide an update to the American people on several decisive new actions we’re taking in our very vigilant effort to combat and ultimately defeat the coronavirus.“We’ve been working very hard on this. We’ve made tremendous progress. When you compare what we’ve done to other areas of the world, it’s pretty incredible. A lot of that had to do with the early designation and the closing of the borders.“As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now, and we closed that border awhile ago. So that was lucky through talent or through luck, call it whatever you want. But through a collective action, and shared sacrifice, national determination we will overcome the threat of the virus.“I also announced Wednesday night following the advice of our medical professionals, who were doing a tremendous job, and we appreciate it very much, that we’re suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have been to Europe in the last 14 days from entering the United States. Citizens, primary residents and our families, and any of the families returning from Europe will be subject to extra screening as well as self-isolation for a period of 14 days. “Today I’d like to provide an update to the American people on several decisive new actions we’re taking in our very vigilant effort to combat and ultimately defeat the coronavirus.“We’ve been working very hard on this.

It gives remote doctors visits and hospital check-ins the power to waive certain federal license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services and states with the greatest need.“No. 2, the ability to waive requirements that critical-access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25, and the length of stay to 96 hours.

As a result of that action today we’re announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test could get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently, but we don’t want people to take a test if — if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it. And we don’t want everyone running out and taking — only have if you have certain symptoms.“Using federal emergency authorities, the F.D.A. approved a new test for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche, a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to half a million additional tests will be available early next week. We’ll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night.“I want to thank Roche, great company, for their incredible work. I would also like to thank Thermo Fisher.

"WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised schools on Friday that closings for at least eight weeks might be the most effective way to contain the coronavirus. The Education Department released school districts from a slew of testing and accountability measures required by federal law.But schools across the country were far ahead of the Trump administration’s advice. A cascade of public school closings gained speed nationwide on Friday, with the largest school district in California, the Los Angeles Unified School District, announcing it was closing, along with the San Diego Unified School District. They joined other large cities like Washington, Miami and Seattle, and more than a dozen states like Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Oregon, New Mexico and Michigan.At least 21,000 schools have been closed or are scheduled to close, according to Education Week, affecting at least 15 million students. A majority of closings announced by school districts range from two to six weeks, which the C.D.C. considered “short- to medium-term closures” that would “not impact” the huge wave of infections that are expected in the next few weeks.Danny Carlson, the associate executive director of policy and advocacy for the National Association of Elementary School Principals, called the timing of the C.D.C. guidance “baffling.” WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised schools on Friday that closings for at least eight weeks might be the most effective way to contain the coronavirus.

It will consider one-year waivers for state-administered tests or requirements that districts test 95 percent of their students. It would also allow waivers for certain measures of a school’s effectiveness ratings, such as chronic absenteeism, as required under the Every Student Succeeds Act.The department also said schools were not obligated to provide special education while classes were canceled for all students, but they must resume services when they reopen or if they shift classes online.The administration’s guidance came at the end of an anxiety-ridden week for elementary and secondary school leaders who have argued over whether to follow their counterparts in higher education in sending students home. “Where was this a week ago?” he said.The C.D.C. conceded that long-term closings could significantly affect academic outcomes for students, economic conditions for struggling families and health conditions for grandparents who care for students.And while it had data that could help decide when to close schools, the C.D.C. said it did not have data on the right time to reopen them.On Thursday, the Education Department announced that it would relieve school systems of some of their responsibilities under federal law.

While colleges and universities moved swiftly to empty campuses and teach remotely for the next several weeks — some for the entire semester — school superintendents have had to contend with the fact that mass school closings could upend entire cities. The nation’s public school system serves more than 50 million students — more than double the number of college students — and provide the most reliable form of child care and social services. The C.D.C.’s previous guidance had advised only on hygienic measures and local decision-making. It was quietly updated on Thursday to include a recommendation that a school should consider closing for two to five days if it had a confirmed case.

While colleges and universities moved swiftly to empty campuses and teach remotely for the next several weeks — some for the entire semester — school superintendents have had to contend with the fact that mass school closings could upend entire cities. The nation’s public school system serves more than 50 million students — more than double the number of college students — and provide the most reliable form of child care and social services. “In college, you’re dealing with adults and the ability to provide online instruction, which many colleges are already doing. That’s not the case in K-12,” said Daniel A. Domenech, the executive director of AASA, the School Superintendents Association. “In terms of educational continuity, we’re going to see a lot of disparity between the districts that have the capacity to do it and those that don’t.”Congressional lawmakers and education leaders have pressed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to help schools navigate the mass closings. The most vulnerable students in public schools rely on critical services like food and special education.Those hardships have led some of the nation’s largest school districts, like New York City — which serves overwhelming numbers of homeless and poor students — to hold off on shutting down.“There are three pillars to protecting this city and the long-term health and safety of our people: our Schools, our mass transit and our health care system,” Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Friday. “In college, you’re dealing with adults and the ability to provide online instruction, which many colleges are already doing.

Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the Trump administration had left schools “agonizing” over decisions that stemmed from a lack of preparation — including enough testing — early in the crisis.“Because there’s no way to track the vector, people don’t want to put anyone in harm’s way,” she said.Facing pressure from parents, conflicting messages from experts and silence from the federal government, superintendents moved on their own.By 12:15 p.m. on Thursday, Superintendent Michael Lubelfeld of the North Shore School District in Illinois was hurrying from his fourth meeting of the day, having just sent his fifth letter of the week about the coronavirus. He had informed the community of his decision to postpone activities, events and gatherings, without the blessing of the public health department.

The district had purchased three-month subscriptions for internet hot spots for 50 families.Still, when he walked in to the emergency school board meeting he had called that evening, Mr. Lubelfeld was unsure — until he faced impassioned parents and frustrated board members.“Now is not the time for complacency; it is the time for decisive action,” pleaded Mia Levy, a mother of two students who is also a doctor and the director of the Rush University Cancer Center. “Your actions will save lives.”Daniel Wertheimer, a father who had already pulled his children out of school, told Mr. Lubelfeld that “because you’re keeping the schools open, there’s going to be folks — elderly, our age — that probably die, and that decision is on you.”Bennett W. Lasko, the president of the school board, expressed frustration that the district was left to make the decision alone, citing “imperfect information, inconsistent from one authority to another.”“We’re volunteers up here, and we’re a reasonably smart group of people, but we’re not able to assess the pros and cons of closing schools,” he said. “We prepare for all types of occurrences, from the God-forbid active shooter to the typical water main break, to the ice day and snow day,” he said. “I cannot think of something that has been at such a scale.”By Thursday Mr. Lubelfeld had already started preparations, reaching out to the local food pantry, library and township to ensure that the 25 percent of students who received federally subsidized meals would have food.

Wallace, he saw, was tapping into something ugly, not just in the South but among white blue-collar supporters in the North.Mr. Turnipseed often mentioned one moment that made a stark impression.He was in Webster, Mass., arranging to use a Polish-American club’s building there for a campaign event. Club officials were such Wallace fans that they told him he could use it at no charge. Then, he said, the club manager asked him to affirm that, if elected, Mr. Wallace would line up all the black people — the man used a racial epithet — and shoot them.“I realized the man was serious,” he said in an interview for the PBS series “Eyes on the Prize.”“And,” he continued, “it kind of got to me.” “What turned me off was not Wallace, but the crowds,” he told The New York Times in 1978.

He was part of a coalition seeking utility rate reform in the early 1970s, an experience that he said further solidified his change of heart. Utilities were charging higher rates to low-volume residential users, many of whom were black.

Utilities were charging higher rates to low-volume residential users, many of whom were black. “The rate hike hearings offered an opportunity to bridge the divide between poor blacks and whites,” Mr. Turnipseed told The Easley Progress of South Carolina in 2010. “Our successful coalition helped me realize how prejudiced I had been against black people.”Mr. Turnipseed also served four years as a state senator, from 1976 to 1980, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1980 and for state attorney general in 1998.In recent interviews, he was often asked to compare the tactics and emotions of Mr. Wallace’s 1968 campaign with those of President Trump during his run for president in 2016.“Both of them,” he told BuzzFeed in 2016, “use a lot of the same kind of scare tactics and fear.”Mr. Turnipseed was born on Aug. 27, 1936, in Mobile, Ala. His father, George, was an entomologist, and his mother, Ruby (Bell) Turnipseed, worked for the post office. A grandfather, he told Mr. Brokaw, was a wizard in the Ku Klux Klan.“When he asked his father about his grandfather’s role in the Klan,” Mr. Brokaw wrote, “he was told, ‘There used to be a lot of good people in the Klan, and they did a lot of good.’ He was about 7 at the time, and he failed to ask exactly how his father defined ‘good.’”Mr. Turnipseed often spoke of the false picture he grew up with, thanks to things like history books with pictures of slave children depicted as dancing and singing.“Our concept of black folks back in those days was like Uncle Remus and Old Black Joe,” he said.Mr. Wallace, he said, would play to the lie of an idyllic South. “The rate hike hearings offered an opportunity to bridge the divide between poor blacks and whites,” Mr. Turnipseed told The Easley Progress of South Carolina in 2010. “Our successful coalition helped me realize how prejudiced I had been against black people.”Mr. Turnipseed also served four years as a state senator, from 1976 to 1980, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1980 and for state attorney general in 1998.In recent interviews, he was often asked to compare the tactics and emotions of Mr. Wallace’s 1968 campaign with those of President Trump during his run for president in 2016.“Both of them,” he told BuzzFeed in 2016, “use a lot of the same kind of scare tactics and fear.”Mr. Turnipseed was born on Aug. 27, 1936, in Mobile, Ala.

While at the university he met Judy Davis; they married in 1963.Mr. Turnipseed first came to Mr. Wallace’s attention when he was working in South Carolina on a campaign to gain tax-exempt status for all-white academies, where families could send their children to avoid court-ordered school integration.“We never admitted the race factor,” he told Mr. Brokaw. “We claimed we were interested in a lower teacher-pupil ratio — but the real reason was all racist.”After his change of heart, Mr. Turnipseed was a member of the national board of the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action; was founding chairman of the Citizens’ Local Environmental Action Network, a South Carolina advocacy group that worked on issues like dealing with toxic waste; and had talk programs on various radio stations.In the mid-1990s his firm was among those that helped the Macedonia Baptist Church of South Carolina sue the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and some of its leaders for burning the church’s building in 1995. The suit resulted in a multimillion-dollar award that, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, transformed the Klan chapter “from one of the most active Klan groups in the nation to a defunct organization.” “George Wallace would make people feel proud of their heritage,” he said. “And this heritage itself is one of terrible, terrible racism.”Mr. Turnipseed, who served in the Army from 1955 to 1957, went to Lees-McRae College in North Carolina on a football scholarship, then transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, receiving an undergraduate degree there in 1962 and a law degree in 1964.

"WASHINGTON — Despite the worsening pandemic, the Trump administration is pushing ahead with tougher work requirements for food stamps, and so far has not offered states the opportunity to cover the uninsured on an emergency basis under Medicaid.The coronavirus appears ready to upend the economic landscape, especially for low-wage workers who could face layoffs as restaurants and entertainment venues empty, travelers hunker down, and school systems close. But so far the administration has declined to change course on its efforts to shrink the social safety net.The Agriculture Department completed its food-stamp rule in December, arguing that the strong economy and tight labor market made it appropriate to require that unemployed, able-bodied adults without children find work to continue receiving assistance. The department estimated that nearly 700,000 people would lose their benefits under the change to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.Democrats and anti-poverty groups pleaded this week for the department to suspend the rule.“Enacting any such changes during this time will only exacerbate current economic anxiety and unnecessarily increase the burden on the very people who need assistance,” Representatives Sanford D. Bishop Jr., Democrat of Georgia, and Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.

In response to the pandemic, the White House and Congress are moving to pass legislation that would likely include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing and additional funds for food assistance programs.Complicating the Agriculture Department’s role, the agency also administers free and reduced-price meals at schools, thousands of which are closing. Mr. Perdue said his department is “working to ensure children who are affected by school closures continue to get fed.” It has granted waivers to California, Washington and Alaska that allows the states to serve meals to low-income children during school closures outside of a group setting while schools are closed. The waivers will be in place until June.The House coronavirus package included a provision that would increase food-stamp benefits to parents who have children that cannot receive meals at school because of closures.“Although it may be necessary to close schools, it is also imperative that we keep in mind that school meals are often the only meals some students receive daily,” said Representative Marcia L. Fudge, Democrat of Ohio and chairwoman of the House Agriculture Committee’s subcommittee on nutrition.Ellen Vollinger, the food stamp director at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy organization, said the coronavirus outbreak presented a new challenge because it was a public health emergency and not a natural disaster.“We know that low-income families have a lot of pressures on their budget, they are often trying to figure out how to pay for food, medicine, their rent, utilities and there is not a lot of extra room,” she said.Medicaid could help poor Americans weather the pandemic, particularly some of the 27 million people lacking health insurance. Yet the Trump administration has not offered states the option of covering some of all of them during the outbreak, a move previous administrations made did during emergencies. President Trump’s emergency declaration could change that by allowing states to quickly receive certain waivers from the rules; such waivers could also streamline the often-burdensome process of enrolling people in Medicaid.

In addition, the House relief package includes a provision that would temporarily increase the federal government’s share of spending on Medicaid. Washington typically covers about 60 percent of the cost, while states cover about 40 percent.The federal government already pays much more of the cost — 90 percent — for millions of adults who became eligible for Medicaid over the last six years in 36 states that chose to expand the program under the Affordable Care Act. That generous federal share could help blunt the economic blow of the pandemic in those states.Seema Verma, who oversees Medicaid in the Trump administration, has actively encouraged states to impose new work requirements on many recipients in recent years, rather than making it easier to enroll. Ms. Verma’s agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, released a statement Friday that said it was responding to requests and questions from states and “working to identify the fastest pathway to meeting their needs.In 2005, the Bush administration allowed states to apply for a temporary expansion of Medicaid to people displaced by Hurricane Katrina just two weeks after the storm hit.“They should be using presumptive eligibility to expedite enrollment, and allow for changes to enrollment, redetermination, and cost-sharing policies that promote patients’ immediate access to care,” said Eliot Fishman, a senior director at the consumer group Families USA, who was a top Medicaid official in the Obama administration.

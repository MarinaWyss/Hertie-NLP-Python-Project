"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland. Mr. Trump’s decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day. Mr. Trump’s decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day. In taking over the White House, Mr. Meadows, 60, a retiring Republican from North Carolina, becomes Mr. Trump’s fourth chief of staff in 38 months, the most that any president has had in such a short time. His arrival almost surely signals more changes to follow, as most of Mr. Mulvaney’s deputies and others on his team are expected to leave, too, possibly including Emma Doyle, his top lieutenant, and Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser.

Hope Hicks, one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted advisers, returns on Monday in a new role working for Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Mulvaney, who technically retained his post as budget director while serving as acting chief of staff, will surrender that, too, and the acting director, Russell T. Vought, appears poised to take the job permanently, an appointment he has quietly lobbied for for months.The change has been a long time coming. The president soured on Mr. Mulvaney a while ago but was warned by advisers not to get rid of him until after his Senate trial, which ended with Mr. Trump’s acquittal on Feb. 6. Throughout the impeachment battle, Mr. Mulvaney was at near-open war with the White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone, at one point seen as a potential successor as chief of staff.Mr. Mulvaney had increasingly been on the losing side of policy battles and appeared less often at Mr. Trump’s side. Some saw a sign of impending dismissal last month at the wedding of Stephen Miller, the president’s senior adviser, and Katie Waldman, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump sat with Mr. Meadows and his wife along with other advisers at one table, while Mr. Mulvaney was left at a lower-tier table, according to a witness. Wedding guests whispered about the optics of the scene, right in front of so many people.

Mr. Trump called Mr. Meadows on Thursday to offer him the job, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Mr. Mulvaney, who took an annual trip to Nevada this week, learned of the decision on Friday, another person familiar with the events said. Mr. Mulvaney did not travel with Mr. Trump to Florida; instead, he sent Ms. Doyle.The president wanted to announce the news on Twitter earlier in the day, but ended up waiting until after a day of travel to Tennessee to survey tornado damage and to Georgia to tour the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to another person close to the situation. Some aides assumed he would therefore wait until Sunday and were taken off-guard at the Friday night tweet.The replacement was widely seen in the West Wing as a chance for the president to reinvigorate his staff, over which Mr. Mulvaney was seen as losing control. Some of the president’s conservative advisers, including Fox News hosts, had been pressing him to replace Mr. Mulvaney.In Mr. Meadows, Mr. Trump will have an ally he considers a confidant and bellwether of congressional conservatives. “I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At a closed-door fund-raiser on Friday evening, he told donors that Mr. Meadows would be “my James Baker,” according to a person in the room, referring to the chief of staff to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Baker is generally considered the gold standard in the post.In a statement of his own, Mr. Meadows praised Mr. Mulvaney for doing “a great job,” adding, “This president and his administration have a long list of incredible victories they’ve delivered to the country during this first term, with the best yet to come.”A founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Meadows has been one of the president’s most ardent defenders. For months during the impeachment battle, Mr. Meadows was a ubiquitous face on television arguing forcefully that the president had done nothing wrong, appearances that cemented his relationship with Mr. Trump.First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows announced in December that he did not plan to seek re-election, hinting at the time that he might work for Mr. Trump in some capacity. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said.

Mr. Mulvaney, 52, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, served as chief of staff for more than 14 months in an “acting” capacity without ever formally being given the title. Mr. Mulvaney brushed off the snub by telling people that everyone in Mr. Trump’s White House was effectively in the job on an acting basis, but the seeming lack of faith or respect invariably made it harder for him to impose authority.Witnesses placed Mr. Mulvaney at the heart of the events that led to Mr. Trump’s impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to incriminate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney carried out Mr. Trump’s order to suspend $391 million in aid to Ukraine, an action declared illegal by the Government Accountability Office. Some advisers later told the president that Mr. Mulvaney had helped ensnare him in impeachment, even though he was following Mr. Trump’s wishes.At a news briefing in October, Mr. Mulvaney contradicted the president’s denial that he had imposed a quid pro quo on the assistance to benefit his own political fortunes. Mr. Mulvaney told reporters that the White House had withheld aid to Ukraine in part to force Kyiv to commit to investigating a widely debunked theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of the Democrats, a story that American intelligence agencies have called Russian disinformation.“Absolutely. No question about that,” Mr. Mulvaney said. He added, “That’s why we held up the money. ”Later that afternoon, Mr. Mulvaney issued a written statement trying to take it back, denying any quid pro quo between the aid and the investigation.The conflicting statements bolstered Democratic critics and dismayed Republican defenders, who were relying on his assurances that the aid suspension was not tied to his demands that Ukraine investigate Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney defied a House subpoena to testify, but House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump in the Senate played his comments from the briefing repeatedly as part of their case.Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, told House investigators last fall that Mr. Mulvaney had been involved in arranging a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that was tied to whether he would conduct the investigations sought by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. She testified that Mr. Mulvaney was working with Gordon D. Sondland, who was then the ambassador to the European Union.

Bolton, then the president’s national security adviser, was alarmed at the machinations and ordered Ms. Hill to report the matter to a White House lawyer. “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” Mr. Bolton told her to tell the lawyer.Unlike his predecessor John F. Kelly, a retired Marine general who left in late 2018, Mr. Mulvaney made a point of not trying to control the famously mercurial president and instead let Trump be Trump. Mr. Kelly said in October, as the House was pursuing its Ukraine inquiry, that he had previously warned the president that such an approach would mean that “you will be impeached.”As Mr. Trump’s first budget director, Mr. Mulvaney helped enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, the president’s signature legislative victory, and rolled back environmental and other regulations. But he was frustrated in his attempts to pare back spending and wound up presiding over a period of rocketing budget deficits that are projected to top $1 trillion a year for the next decade.During Mr. Mulvaney’s time as acting chief of staff, the economy remained strong, and by the end of his tenure, Mr. Trump’s approval rating had risen to 49 percent in Gallup’s poll, the highest of his presidency. He made a point of using Camp David to build ties with lawmakers and aides who otherwise previously felt neglected.Mr. Mulvaney recently told an audience in Britain that he regularly conflicted with the president over various decisions but made a point of keeping that private. “I disagree with the president every single day,” he said. “You just don’t hear about it — that’s not my job.”Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman from New York, and Annie Karni, Katie Rogers, Michael D.

"President Trump claimed again on Friday that anyone who needed a coronavirus test “gets a test.” But from Washington State to Florida to New York, doctors and patients are clamoring for tests that they say are in woefully short supply, and their frustration is mounting alongside the growing number of cases around the country.In California, where thousands are being monitored for the virus, only 516 tests had been conducted by the state as of Thursday. Washington health officials have more cases than they can currently process. And in New York, where cases have quadrupled this week, a New York City official pleaded for more test kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The slow federal action on this matter has impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic,” the official said in a letter Friday.More than 300 cases have been confirmed, at least 17 have died, and thousands are in self-quarantine. Public health officials are warning that no one knows how deeply the virus will spread, in part because the federal government’s flawed rollout of tests three weeks ago has snowballed into an embarrassing fiasco of national proportions.

Public health officials are warning that no one knows how deeply the virus will spread, in part because the federal government’s flawed rollout of tests three weeks ago has snowballed into an embarrassing fiasco of national proportions. The latest two deaths were announced late Friday night in Florida, marking the first time fatal cases were not on the West Coast.In the last week, Mr. Trump and his top officials repeatedly promised that 1 million to 1.5 million tests would be sent around the country, even though labs — government and private ones alike — have struggled to get the tests running amid a growing number of infections and rising demand for tests. Despite an order Wednesday by the C.D.C. to greatly expand criteria for who can be tested, many hospitals and state health authorities continued to limit tests to those at the highest risk for infection, adding to the confusion and frustration, especially in hot spots like California and Washington.In California, Cindy Homen, 58, followed the advice she had heard from public health officials this week and emailed her primary care doctor about getting tested, at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Santa Rosa, Calif., when she started to come down with coughing fits and a sore throat.She received a reply Thursday telling her she did not need to get tested, that most people exposed to the virus recover after experiencing mild symptoms. She was advised to wash her hands and stay home. “At this point, testing is very limited,” her doctor wrote.“This whole thing is just a big joke,” Ms. Homen said. “How do they track the coronavirus if there aren’t enough test kits and they don’t even want you to come in?” The latest two deaths were announced late Friday night in Florida, marking the first time fatal cases were not on the West Coast.In the last week, Mr. Trump and his top officials repeatedly promised that 1 million to 1.5 million tests would be sent around the country, even though labs — government and private ones alike — have struggled to get the tests running amid a growing number of infections and rising demand for tests.

On Friday, Mr. Pence said it would be a “matter of weeks” before Americans could get easy access to a coronavirus test.And on Thursday, he seemed to acknowledge that the administration’s estimates were high. Speaking at a 3M plant in Minnesota where another item in short supply — respirator masks — are made, he said, “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.” Mr. Pence added: “For those who we believe have been exposed, for those who are showing symptoms, we’ve been able to provide the testing.”On Friday, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, was prompted to speak by the president at the White House signing of the $8.3 billion emergency spending bill for the coronavirus. Mr. Azar told reporters: “I just want to make it clear that in terms of tests, we have provided all the tests to the state of Washington and the state of California that they’ve asked for. The production and shipping of tests that we’ve talked about all week is completely on schedule.” Over the past few days, Vice President Mike Pence has been moderating expectations about how quickly the tests would be widely available.

In addition, he said, Integrated DNA Technologies, the private contractor working with the C.D.C. to ship to the private sector and hospitals, has already distributed enough materials for 700,000 tests.

At a short news conference during the president’s visit to the C.D.C. lab in Atlanta on Friday, Dr. Robert R.

They have the tests and the tests are beautiful.” But states and public health experts are warning that access is still limited and varies from state to state, hampering the ability to know how far the virus has spread or for how long it has gone undetected in some regions of the country.“We’re going to need millions and millions and millions of tests,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a CNN town hall Thursday. But states and public health experts are warning that access is still limited and varies from state to state, hampering the ability to know how far the virus has spread or for how long it has gone undetected in some regions of the country.“We’re going to need millions and millions and millions of tests,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a CNN town hall Thursday. After weeks of delays by the C.D.C. because of a “manufacturing problem"" in one component of its test, and the Food and Drug Administration’s refusal to lift testing restrictions for large academic centers or private companies until Feb. 29, many laboratories have begun to process tests only in the last few days. There still is no central reporting system to track the number of tests conducted or the number of patients who have been tested.[Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic here.]It is nearly impossible to know precisely how many people in the United States have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. reported Thursday that it had tested 1,583 patients since the beginning of the outbreak, but it is not making public how many tests are being done at state and local public health laboratories, despite publishing similar data on the seasonal flu. Many local labs are just beginning to receive long-delayed test kits and, even at full capacity, will be able to run only about 100 tests per day.A total of 71 public laboratories in 47 states and the District of Columbia had the capacity to test for the coronavirus as of Friday afternoon, according to the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents government laboratories around the country. That’s up from just eight labs able to process tests last Thursday.“We’ve seen major progress with essentially the lights coming on across the country,” said Scott Becker, the association’s chief executive. After weeks of delays by the C.D.C. because of a “manufacturing problem"" in one component of its test, and the Food and Drug Administration’s refusal to lift testing restrictions for large academic centers or private companies until Feb. 29, many laboratories have begun to process tests only in the last few days. There still is no central reporting system to track the number of tests conducted or the number of patients who have been tested.[Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic here.]It is nearly impossible to know precisely how many people in the United States have been tested for the coronavirus.

But the delays mean that “we’re absolutely a few weeks behind where we should be,” he said, adding, “There is no way you can sugarcoat that.”Maine said it was still bringing its state laboratory online. Pennsylvania officials said they would have the capacity to test 150 specimens a day at the state laboratory beginning this weekend. Arkansas can process eight to 10 tests daily, and has so far tested six patients.Large, private laboratories are also ramping up. LabCorp, a major diagnostics company, began offering a coronavirus test Thursday evening. Another firm, Quest Diagnostics, said it would launch a similar product on Monday.“The reason that’s important, the reason that meets future demand is because the enormous capacity of these commercial laboratories and others in the country are precisely how we will make coronavirus tests available for your local doctor, available to your pharmacy and broadly available to the American public,” Mr. Pence said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing Friday.But Wendy Bost, a Quest spokeswoman, sounded a more cautious tone. “While we believe we have capacity to accommodate initial demand, this is an evolving situation and we anticipate building additional capacity over time,” she said in a statement.

Dr. Alex Greninger, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak, said the university’s lab had tested about 400 patients since it set up operations earlier this week under new federal guidelines. The lab can yield results in about eight hours and is testing patients from several hospitals around Washington State. “I’m entirely focused on testing and building out operations that can handle thousands of tests a day,” he said.

Meanwhile, the state laboratories in Washington have more cases than they can currently process.“We have a small backlog that we hope to be through very soon,” said Danielle Koenig, a spokeswoman for that state’s health department. The agency had tested 91 patients as of Wednesday, and attributed the backlog to both a lack of staffing and physical capacity. Their facilities can currently handle 200 samples per day, with each patient requiring between one and three tests.In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis cautioned that the state had not yet received enough testing kits. “I know they have tens of thousands that will eventually be en route,” he said. “We’d like to get them, obviously, as soon as possible.”So far, the state is conducting tests at three public health labs in Miami, Tampa and Jacksonville.The C.D.C.’s decision to remove most criteria for testing took some state officials and large health systems off-guard.“Everyone under the sun who is going to develop a cough is going to want to get a test for coronavirus,” Dr. Mark Levine, the commissioner of Vermont’s health department, said on the day the changes were announced. On Friday, Vermont health officials said they had run eight tests in the state. Many states reported on Friday that they had run only a handful of tests.In several states, health officials have been sending out guidance to physicians encouraging them to first test for other likely causes, such as the flu, before sending samples to state laboratories.

Mr. Becker, of the public health lab association, said he worried that mixed messages from the Trump administration could create demand for testing that “has the potential to overwhelm the public health system, and the country.”In Colorado, Scott Bookman, the incident commander overseeing the coronavirus for the state’s health department, warned: “We don’t have unlimited supply going forward, so we want to be careful with that.”Mr. Bookman said Colorado had tested samples from 100 patients, and its lab could test samples for 160 patients per day, if needed. State health officials announced Colorado’s first two infections on Thursday, with additional cases on Friday.Utah, where one patient has been treated for coronavirus, can test about 30 people daily. That’s enough to keep up with current demand but there are potential bottlenecks: Parts of the test are conducted manually, and supplies that come from outside vendors may become scarce.“We’re not turning away tests, but our capacity right now is limited by the fact that we have a human being extracting the DNA,” said Jenny Johnson, a Utah spokeswoman.

Dr. John Strayer, an emergency doctor at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, Wash., where some of the patients infected with the virus had been admitted, said the loosened criteria have “added to my work.”He said he now has to triage patients based on whether they were sick enough to need a test urgently. Most people are sent back home and told to quarantine until they get better.Dr. Strayer said the new policy had certainly created “lots of very angry patients.”Kate Mannle, 37, of Seattle spent a week trying to get tested. Ms. Mannle returned Saturday from an overseas trip that included a layover in South Korea, which is experiencing an outbreak of the new virus. On Sunday, she developed a fever and a cough, but was told by her doctor and hospitals that she was not sick enough to get tested.Ms. Mannle, the director of training programs for a conservation nonprofit, quarantined herself inside her one-bedroom apartment in Seattle, where she spent the week sleeping, doing a little yoga and trying to recover from her 101-degree fever and respiratory infection. She plans to stay inside until 24 to 48 hours after her cough goes away. She suspects she did indeed contract the virus, but she will probably never know for sure.“They’ve put up so many barriers,” she said. “I’m tired of it and I’m ready to move on.” She added: “But what about the next one?

"Bernie Sanders was several takes into a video delivering a message he desperately needed to convey last fall — that he was healthy enough to soldier on after his heart attack — when his team realized something was not clicking.You have to tell people how you really feel, one aide chimed in, according to a person who worked on the shoot. The heart attack not only deepened your commitment to health reform, the aide said; it was personal.Public introspection is not Mr. Sanders’s go-to move. But he gave it a shot. Near the end of the seven-minute video posted on his Instagram account in October, after swipes at “corporate media” and a pitch for “Medicare for All,” the candidate haltingly admitted that his hospitalization had indeed prompted him to take stock.

But is there a deeper layer, a “real” Bernie the public does not get to see?People who have known Mr. Sanders for years say that, if anything, he is more intense and can be insensitive to people who encounter his moods — in other words, even more Bernie than Bernie. Being around Mr. Sanders, they say, is to watch him endlessly wind himself up and back down, long periods of tension punctuated by brief, welcome intervals of calm.Within hours of having two cardiac stents installed after his heart attack, the senator was back on the phone with senior aides in Washington, grilling them on proposed staff hires, dictating media strategy and asking for details of an advertising buy, aides said.That intensity can sometimes cross the line.

In the run-up to the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Tad Devine, then a senior campaign adviser, pressured Mr. Sanders to commission a survey gauging his strengths and weaknesses. The candidate reluctantly agreed.A few days later, Mr. Sanders exploded at Mr. Devine when a journalist obtained a leaked recording of the questions. “What did you do? You are trying to destroy my reputation and my image!” Mr. Sanders shouted at the adviser, bursting through the closed door of his office in Des Moines, according to a witness.Even his amusements seem to be in character. He uses an iPad (not a phone) to devour social media and news, and loves to watch old boxing matches and movies like “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Melancholia,” a 2011 dystopian drama that ends with the obliteration of the Earth. He sings along, tunelessly, with 1960s and 1970s folk rock on car radios, takes long walks with his wife and adores his grandchildren.

Mostly, he works.“He is always working and looking to move the ball forward, even when he is having a casual conversation,” said Michaeleen Crowell, the former chief of staff in his Senate office. “It’s hard for him to take time off for himself. He’s happiest when he’s working.”A ‘Lone Ranger’ Finds AlliesIn January, Hillary Clinton, who believes Mr. Sanders’s refusal to quickly exit the 2016 primaries damaged her cause, made news with her comment that “nobody likes” Mr. Sanders in the Senate — ushering in a debate over whether he was simply too abrasive to get elected.The claim was not entirely baseless. Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, was deeply unpopular for many of his 16 years in the House of Representatives, where he bucked his own leadership and pelted bills with amendments, many of the gadfly variety.“He was like a lone ranger,” Representative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat who is one of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s closest allies, said in an interview last summer. She called his record “thin.”But the Senate has a higher threshold for grandstanding and eccentricity, so Mr. Sanders, who forged an alliance with the former majority leader Harry Reid, found a more forgiving crowd. He is less disliked than seen as a loner prone to delivering irritating sermons, fellow senators said.“No, people don’t hate Bernie,” said a Democratic senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I’d say the feeling is closer to resentment, because some of us have to take the tough votes on things so he can keep his brand pure.”As a boss, Mr. Sanders is notoriously tough. Former aides have described him as demanding and particular, sometimes to a fault.

Mr. Sanders “never makes you feel like you’re good enough to be in the room with him,” one former aide said. When an appearance at a rally in New Hampshire last fall was delayed, an impatient Mr. Sanders brushed past an organizer and barked: “I’m the candidate, not you. I’m going on,” according to a person backstage.More serious outbursts are rare, and Mr. Sanders doesn’t tend to take pushback personally, several former aides said. Mr. Devine, who declined to comment, gave back as good as he got in the exchange, according to a person who was in the room.Mr. Sanders denies that he has ever been an abusive boss, but allows that he can be difficult to work with, and has attributed his impatience to his own sense that he is falling short of his own high expectations.“Look, I don’t tolerate [expletive] terribly well,” he told the New York Times editorial board in December. “I’m not good at backslapping. I’m not good at pleasantries. If you have your birthday, I’m not going to call you up to congratulate you, so you’ll love me and you’ll write nice things about me.”He has virtually no tolerance for small talk. Steve Slavin, a high school friend of his and later his college roommate, recalled the day in 2008 when Mr. Sanders invited him to speak at his enshrinement on James Madison High School’s Wall of Distinction. After a luncheon for the honorees, the two made their way to the auditorium, taking seats together in the front row.

As they waited, Mr. Sanders did not say a word to him and instead spent the time writing notes on a piece of paper, silently.“He was scribbling away what he was going to say,” Mr. Slavin said in an interview. “We didn’t talk at all.”Creature ComfortsThough he can be difficult, with a stubborn streak that can exasperate, close friends and allies have learned to adjust. Perhaps that is why his innermost circle is so small, made up of his wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders; Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager; Warren Gunnels, his Senate policy director; and a pair of Burlington buddies, Huck Gutman and Richard Sugarman.Mr. Weaver said in early 2019 that he would not oversee Mr. Sanders’s 2020 run, after several staff members on the 2016 campaign came forward with claims that incidents of sexism and harassment were not appropriately addressed. But Mr. Sanders never had any intention of sidelining his close friend, and Mr. Weaver remains as influential as ever, according to campaign aides.The candidate’s need to control his surroundings also extends to the physical environment. He hates the cramped hassle of flying commercial, aides say, even if going private doesn’t entirely comport with his brand.For years, Mr. Sanders’s staff members have compiled hotel dos and don’ts for a man who rises early but sometimes finds it hard to fall asleep. The list, distributed to aides in his entourage and shared with hotel employees, stipulates that his room must be kept at an arctic 60 degrees. That he needs an oscillating fan. Other wish lists have requested that written materials be removed. That the room must be at least five doors away from the ice machine and from the elevator, though the walk to the elevator must not be too long.

That was just a starting point, according to aides who went along on Mr. Sanders’s weeklong tour with the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, in 2017. The morning before he was to arrive a hotel in Las Vegas, his staff summoned the hotel engineer to jury-rig the air-conditioner to the required temperature.There was one more problem: Someone had to stay in the room to keep a motion sensor from kicking the thermostat back to 72 degrees. A representative of the Sanders team looked hopefully at a Perez aide, who declined to volunteer. (A Sanders spokesman did not deny the episode, but was skeptical anyone would be asked to do such a thing.)Friends emphasize that Mr. Sanders does not demand star treatment (he routinely rejects upgrades from singles to suites, aides said). It is just that he craves peace and solitude, often to collect his thoughts and catalog them on his ever-present yellow legal pad.The heart attack limited another form of relaxation: eating. Mr. Sanders has been trying to shift to berries, grains and smoothies, but he leans toward heartier stuff — spare ribs, steaks, cheesecake, fried chicken, fried rice, bacon and eggs. He proposed to his wife outside a Burlington Friendly’s after polishing off a hot fudge sundae.Unwinding is not easy for Mr. Sanders under any circumstances, but he seems most likely to let his guard down around children. As he awaited the results of the New Hampshire primary, he wandered the halls of an airport hotel in Manchester with his grandchildren, a person on his staff said, introducing them to campaign aides and giving them a guided tour of vending machines and conference rooms.Randy Bryce, a Sanders campaign surrogate from Wisconsin, remembered going on a campaign swing with Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire last year. He had brought his 13-year-old son, and the three of them, along with Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, grabbed lunch at a coffee shop.At one point, Mr. Bryce got up; when he returned to the table, he saw Mr. Sanders smuggling chips to his son. “Don’t tell your dad I’m giving you all my chips,” Mr. Sanders said loud enough for Mr. Bryce to hear.

As he awaited the results of the New Hampshire primary, he wandered the halls of an airport hotel in Manchester with his grandchildren, a person on his staff said, introducing them to campaign aides and giving them a guided tour of vending machines and conference rooms.Randy Bryce, a Sanders campaign surrogate from Wisconsin, remembered going on a campaign swing with Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire last year. He had brought his 13-year-old son, and the three of them, along with Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, grabbed lunch at a coffee shop.At one point, Mr. Bryce got up; when he returned to the table, he saw Mr. Sanders smuggling chips to his son. “Don’t tell your dad I’m giving you all my chips,” Mr. Sanders said loud enough for Mr. Bryce to hear. Later, speaking at a union dinner, Mr. Sanders introduced Mr. Bryce’s son in front of everyone. “My son will never forget that,” Mr. Bryce said. “It was very touching.”Ms. Crowell, Mr. Sanders’s former Senate aide, said his favorite event each year was a summer barbecue in his Burlington backyard that culminated in a Wiffle ball game with the senator as pitcher. One memory, from a few years back: Her son, then a preteen, connected with a Sanders pitch and rocketed a line drive that barely missed the boss’s head. “I looked over, and Bernie has got this huge smile on his face,” she said.Mr. Sanders’s own childhood in stoop-ball-era Brooklyn was, by his own accounts, a painful one, and he has been candid in his memoirs about the lingering impact of the turbulence. He grew up with his brother, Larry, in a household chronically short of money, riven by fighting between his father, Eli, a paint salesman, and his mother, Dorothy, who died when he was 18.Those experiences are never far from his mind, friends say. During a trip to New York in 2013, before he was a national celebrity, Mr. Sanders headed to Midwood to check out his old apartment building on East 26th Street, according to an aide who accompanied him.Like any self-respecting Brooklynite, he defeated the buzzer lock by politely holding the door open for someone who was exiting the building. But once he got upstairs, he could not persuade the tenant to let him in.Mr. Sanders would not be stopped. With a dart, he stuck his head inside the doorway, peered around, absorbed it all, thanked the woman and headed back downstairs.

"Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign organization in key Super Tuesday states was so flimsy that it shocked and alarmed Democratic Party leaders. Mr. Biden had little cash for advertising on the airwaves. His message just days before the big vote was sometimes unfocused and meandering.But when 14 states voted on Tuesday, none of that mattered: Mr. Biden swept to victory in 10 of them, reflecting a quickly coalescing moderate wing of the Democratic Party and a desperation among voters to start taking the fight to President Trump.“There’s no analogous situation that I can think of in presidential politics where a candidate who was really on the brink of extinction came back and, over four days, took command of a race without benefit of media or organization,” said David Axelrod, who served as chief strategist for President Barack Obama. “It’s an unparalleled situation.”Mr. Biden was greatly aided by the late endorsements of two former rivals, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who exited the race at the beginning of the week. Mr. Biden’s overwhelming victory in South Carolina last Saturday, powered by African-American voters, injected a stunning dose of momentum into the campaign after losses in the first three nominating contests.

But Tuesday’s results also showed that in a matchup that was largely against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the less quantifiable elements of Mr. Biden’s campaign — his association with Mr. Obama, his empathy and his more moderate approach to governing — outweighed his lack of organizational heft in many places.Those operational challenges have not evaporated. Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had “virtually no operation” in his state, which votes on Tuesday.Yet as the presidential contest moves into a battle for large, delegate-rich states like Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Florida, Mr. Biden is racing to cement his advantage with the sprawling coalition that propelled him in the past week — this time with the momentum, money and avalanche of endorsements that had eluded him throughout the race, even as his team scrambles to scale up.Headed into the next round of contests on Tuesday, when six states including Michigan and Missouri will vote, Mr. Biden is again seeking to run up the score in heavily African-American congressional districts, build on his newfound strength with moderate suburbanites and fight Mr. Sanders for white working-class voters. He is quickly rerouting some staff to key states, uncorking new ad spending and leaning into sharper criticisms of Mr. Sanders, now his chief rival for the nomination.Mr. Biden’s financial fortunes are rapidly changing: Since last Saturday, the day of his resounding victory in South Carolina, his campaign has raised more than $22 million in online donations — more than double its total fund-raising in the entire month of January.

Mr. Biden’s surrogates have sprung into action, seeking to help him acquire additional support in upcoming key states through methods both traditional — Ms. Klobuchar deployed to Michigan for Mr. Biden — and creative: The former U.S. ambassador to Ireland was listed as hosting an organizing event recently for Mr. Biden in the small city of Bolivar, Mo.According to his campaign, Mr. Biden has more than 70 endorsements in Missouri, more than 50 in Florida and around 20 in Michigan. Among his newest endorsers in Michigan is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was named a national co-chair of his campaign.Former Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had focused resources on South Carolina out of necessity. But with an eye on the March 17 contest in his own state, Mr. Nelson said, “Now I think you will see a flood of people that will be coming in and augmenting the existing staff in Florida.”“People like a winner,” added Mr. Nelson, who has been pounding the phones, seeking to get more state legislators on board.Still, there is limited time to build out the kind of on-the-ground infrastructure that can often make a difference in close races.In Michigan, Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, another Biden supporter, said the Biden campaign was relying on volunteers, and had long made clear that it did not intend to establish a large presence of paid staff in the state.“They flat-out said we’re not putting field resources in Michigan,” he said, noting that he agreed with their approach. “I told them we’d do the organizing with the volunteers here and we’d be ready to go on March 10, and I think we will be.” Mr. Biden’s surrogates have sprung into action, seeking to help him acquire additional support in upcoming key states through methods both traditional — Ms. Klobuchar deployed to Michigan for Mr. Biden — and creative: The former U.S. ambassador to Ireland was listed as hosting an organizing event recently for Mr. Biden in the small city of Bolivar, Mo.According to his campaign, Mr. Biden has more than 70 endorsements in Missouri, more than 50 in Florida and around 20 in Michigan.

In contrast to 2016, Washington and Idaho Democrats have now embraced primaries — not caucuses, which tend to draw only the most committed activists — a move that some Biden allies hope will allow him to cut into Mr. Sanders’s potential advantages in those states, both of which he won handily in the previous presidential race.On Thursday, Mr. Sanders canceled a rally in Mississippi, a state with a heavily African-American Democratic electorate, redeploying instead to delegate-heavy Michigan, where he and Mr. Biden look poised for a fierce fight over the blue-collar workers that helped Mr. Sanders narrowly win the state in his 2016 presidential bid.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have criticized each other during the primary race — over Mr. Biden’s vote to authorize the war in Iraq, for example, or Mr. Sanders’s record on gun control — but they now both appear willing to wage their most pointed fights to date. Mr. Sanders has released ads jabbing Mr. Biden over his position on trade and his past support at times for Social Security freezes — reviving a fight the two men had in Iowa that Mr. Sanders’s allies believe played to his advantage.Mr. Sanders also released an ad highlighting his ties to Mr. Obama, a move that drew incredulity from some of Mr. Biden’s supporters who note not only Mr. Biden’s service as vice president under Mr. Obama, but also that Mr. Sanders reportedly weighed a primary challenge to Mr. Obama in the 2012 election.

The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday.

Recognizing the stakes here, Mr. Sanders is assailing Mr. Biden for his support of what he called “disastrous trade agreements like Nafta.” And his campaign is airing a commercial in the manufacturing-heavy state that features a former autoworker highlighting the former vice president’s lack of regret for supporting the pact while pointing out that Mr. Sanders has opposed free trade deals.

As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.

While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said former Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.” While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election.

And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals.

It is clear why Mr. Sanders is scrambling — the Super Tuesday results carried ominous signs for his candidacy. In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.

Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest.

But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Saturday continued sending contradictory signals about its response to the coronavirus, as a top federal health official appeared to walk back President Trump’s claim that “anyone who wants a test can get a test.”The health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, cautioned that only those who have gone through a doctor or medical professional can be approved for a test, a message that appeared to undercut Mr. Trump, who delivered his promise on Friday as he toured the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test,” Mr. Azar said at an off-camera briefing at the White House. “That is our medical system in the United States, in the same way that you may not get a cardiac medicine if your doctor doesn’t prescribe that.”Mr. Azar’s comments were another instance of key officials in recent days correcting or clarifying Mr. Trump, who has sought to project calm and preparedness as the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States. More than 100 new cases were announced in the United States on Saturday, including two deaths in Washington State and dozens of new cases in New York State.

More than 100 new cases were announced in the United States on Saturday, including two deaths in Washington State and dozens of new cases in New York State. The communications clash between the president and top officials overseeing the federal government’s response to the coronavirus could obscure valuable knowledge about it, said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the author of “The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide: Leadership and Management in Trying Times.”“Things change in a crisis — the advice may change in a crisis,” said Dr. Sharfstein, a former top F.D.A. official who teaches a class on the topic at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And so it’s really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice.”Mr. Azar on Saturday defended Mr. Trump’s phrasing, saying it reflected a recent shift by federal health agencies, which have loosened testing regulations. The C.D.C on Wednesday lifted all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus.

“What the president said yesterday at the C.D.C., that is consistent with what the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. are saying, which is we as regulators, or as those shipping the test, are not restricting who can get tested,” Mr. Azar said. “We are leaving that to the professional judgment of doctors and public health officials.”Mr. Trump used “shorthand” to make that point, Mr. Azar said.“What he meant to say is we’re not in the way of that,” Mr. Azar said. “And he knows the numbers. We brief him daily.” The communications clash between the president and top officials overseeing the federal government’s response to the coronavirus could obscure valuable knowledge about it, said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the author of “The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide: Leadership and Management in Trying Times.”“Things change in a crisis — the advice may change in a crisis,” said Dr. Sharfstein, a former top F.D.A. official who teaches a class on the topic at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And so it’s really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice.”Mr. Azar on Saturday defended Mr. Trump’s phrasing, saying it reflected a recent shift by federal health agencies, which have loosened testing regulations. The C.D.C on Wednesday lifted all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus.

We brief him daily.” Mr. Azar’s assertion echoed one made by Vice President Mike Pence at a White House news conference Friday evening, in which the vice president said that doctors treating potentially symptomatic Americans could contact local officials and have state labs do the testing.During a visit to the mask producer 3M in Minnesota on Thursday, Mr. Pence acknowledged the constraints of testing. “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,” he said.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has remained publicly upbeat, minimizing the potential consequences of the virus, which he has said could disappear this spring in warmer weather. “A vast majority are going to be fine,” the president said on Friday about Americans who have the virus, portraying it as similar to the flu.“I’m not concerned at all,” the president said on Saturday when asked about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House.In private, White House officials have cast Mr. Azar as “alarmist.”On Friday, Mr. Trump characterized the government’s testing aptitude as “amazing” and called the C.D.C.’s test “perfect,” statements that have been roundly disputed by scientists and health officials who have expressed alarm over the speed with which the C.D.C. has tested and over the quality of its tests.Consistent messaging, Dr. Sharfstein said, helps with the “fear of the unknown.”“Testing is a more confusing topic than it can seem,” he said. “People can be overly reassured by a negative test or overly panicked by a positive test. Having a thoughtful approach to testing is important.”The number of people who can be tested for the coronavirus and the number of tests available are fluid, federal officials said on Saturday at the White House briefing.

Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, said that 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private health labs as of Friday evening, and hundreds of thousands more were being surveyed for quality at the C.D.C. on Saturday. He said that between public health labs and C.D.C. tests, the total number of samples that have been tested was over 5,860.

Pressed over whether an ill person who consults a doctor and is recommended for a test can get one in a timely way, Mr. Azar said on Saturday that “there’s no reason that should not happen.”Doctors and patients across the nation have painted a much different picture of availability, clamoring for tests they believe are in short supply. In California, only 516 tests had been conducted as of Thursday. Health officials in Washington State have more cases than they can currently process. In New York City, officials have pleaded for more test kits from the C.D.C.State officials facing a growing number of cases criticized the Trump administration this weekend for what they described as its contradictions. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that he was “battling” mixed messages from the federal government.“You have the president saying anybody who wants a test can have a test, it’s beautiful,” he said on MSNBC. “You have the vice president saying we can’t do the tests. We don’t have the capacity.”“That confusion, I think, adds to the fear and the frustration of people, because if government doesn’t know what it’s doing, well then people feel they’re really alone,” Mr. Cuomo added.

After Mr. Pence visited Washington State this week to signal the administration’s support for the state, where 14 deaths have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle area, he praised its governor, Jay Inslee. Mr. Trump then called Mr. Inslee a “snake.”“Let me just tell you we have a lot of problems with the governor,” Mr. Trump said in Atlanta on Friday. “So Mike may be happy with him, but I’m not, OK?”Mr. Inslee wrote on Twitter that it was “important for leaders to speak with one voice.”“I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page,” he said.Mr. Trump has also sought to contain public alarm by registering fewer cases of the coronavirus, a decision that public health experts say risks misleading Americans about where the virus has spread. The president said he would prefer not to let 3,533 people on a cruise ship held off the coast of San Francisco to disembark onto American soil, even if they were placed into quarantine, in part because it would inflate the number of American infections. Nineteen crew members and two passengers of the ship have tested positive for the coronavirus.Two passengers on the ship, Cookie Clark, 76, and her husband, Joe Clark, 81, of Oakdale, Calif., said they had been watching the news constantly and were angry when they heard Mr. Trump say on Friday that he preferred the ship not dock in the United States.“As American citizens, we have a right to be back on U.S. soil,” Mr. Clark said.Ms. Clark, a retired realtor, said she was appalled. “We’re just numbers to him,” she said.Josh Michaud, an associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that it was in the public’s interest to know where cases of the virus were as soon as possible.“That’s going to be the foundation for developing an effective response. You need to know where the disease is to erect the resources,” Mr. Michaud said. “If you don’t, you’re flying blind.”Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting from New York and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco.

Reince Priebus, John F. Kelly and Mick Mulvaney each tried to navigate Mr. Trump’s harum-scarum West Wing in his own way, alternately trying to control, channel or enable the advice-resistant president, only to eventually fall out of favor. Mr. Meadows has an advantage none of them did in that he has been a political confidant and ardent champion for much longer before taking the job and many in Mr. Trump’s circle were encouraged by his ascension. But he has never been tested like this before.“The president hasn’t gone through four chiefs of staff in three and a half years because he’s trying to figure out how to govern,” said Chris Whipple, the author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of those who served in the role. “He’s gone through four chiefs because he’s not interested in governing. He lives to campaign — to divide, demonize and disrupt — not to get things done.” Reince Priebus, John F.

A former real estate developer turned conservative bomb-thrower, Mr. Meadows made his name as a disrupter of the system, clashing repeatedly with House Republican leaders over spending, immigration and other issues, and inciting the rebellion that forced Speaker John A. Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded. He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor, on the floor during a contentious vote. In that sense, then, Mr. Meadows may make sense.

He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor, on the floor during a contentious vote. Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.“It’s a great move by the president,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows’s appointment. “Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he’s a great wartime consigliere and we’re heading into election season. Mark understands the president’s electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.”While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump’s racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings’s memorial service that talked about the value of the “unexpected friendship.”“I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,” Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. “We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he’s someone who makes things about policy and not people.”Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows’s policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. “I don’t see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,” she said. “I don’t think that’s possible. And if he thinks that’s possible, he’s probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.”Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described “fat nerd” and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate. He ran for the House in 2012 as an outspoken critic of the Republican establishment.

He ran for the House in 2012 as an outspoken critic of the Republican establishment. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. “2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,” he said that year. He later called it “probably a poor choice of words on my part,” and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in “American Carnage.”Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the “Access Hollywood” tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta’s book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman — so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. “Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,” former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. “They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.”Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.

The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work. But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president. At one point early last year, during testimony by Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump’s.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to “actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.” Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows “one of my best friends,” and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president’s defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump’s camp. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney’s corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.“Mark is always up for the challenge,” Mr. Gaetz said. “We all knew when Mark wasn’t running for re-election that he didn’t lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it’s no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.” But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president.

"A Florida woman was charged on Thursday after officials said she filled out 10 voter registration forms with false information, at least six of which enrolled Democratic and independent voters in the Republican Party without their consent.The woman, Cheryl A. Hall, 63, of Clermont, Fla., worked for Florida First, a voter registration group heavily funded by America First Policies, which supports President Trump.America First Policies announced plans last year to spend more than $20 million on voter registration efforts in at least four battleground states: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.Alan Hays, the supervisor of elections in Lake County, Fla., near Orlando, said that although Ms. Hall was charged with submitting 10 false voter registration forms, he believes she might have submitted another 109 forms with false information.

Florida holds its presidential primary on March 17, and Lake County began early voting on Thursday.“It has absolutely nothing to do with party politics,” said Mr. Hays, a Republican. “If you’re misbehaving, I’m going to call you on it.”ImageCheryl A.

The registration forms that switched their party affiliation were stamped with a number belonging to Florida First, and when he contacted the group, it traced the forms back to Ms. Hall, he said.Although the forms contained the correct names of voters, their dates of birth, Social Security numbers and other details were incorrect and automatically flagged by the county election database as unverifiable, he said.“It’s just really bizarre,” Mr. Hays said. “I don’t know what part of her imagination was convinced she could get away with this.”Ms. Hall was charged with 10 counts of submitting false voter registration information and released on $20,000 bond on Thursday, according to the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.At least six of the forms were of Democrats or independents who had their party affiliation changed to Republican, Mr. Hays said. The others had their signatures or other details falsified, he said.“We don’t know what she was hoping to accomplish,” said Lt. John Herrell of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, adding that it “certainly does not appear” that Florida First did anything wrong. Ms. Hall, he said, may have simply gone “off the rails.”No one answered at a phone number listed for Ms. Hall, and it was not immediately clear if she had a lawyer.

Florida First has advertised that it pays $15 to $18 an hour to voter registration canvassers “who believe in the conservative principles of limited government, keeping taxes low and that an overly intrusive Federal government has a negative impact on our citizens.”Mr. Hays said he had seen Ms. Hall, a registered Republican, canvassing with voter registration forms at several community events.At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Hays said he wanted voters to know that even if unauthorized changes were made to their registration files, they could still cast a provisional ballot and election officials would ensure that every eligible vote was counted.

She was able to leverage her language skills to pivot to another career instead.“You can tell all the stories you want,” Ms. Uleski said. “But if you don’t have the credentials, you don’t get work.”In his State of the Union address to Congress last month, President Trump made a significant economic boast that did not garner much attention: the historic decline in veteran unemployment, which now rests around 3 percent.

Like other Americans, veterans have benefited from a roaring economy and a robust labor market. But as a group, they are often hampered by the difficulty of converting skills gained in wars to private-sector jobs, a lack of strong professional networks and a culture of treating veterans as charity cases.Underemployment is one of the greatest issues faced by returning veterans — and by their spouses, who often lose ground through constant relocations. Veterans are 37 percent more likely to be underemployed than nonveterans, a recent study by LinkedIn found.“Underemployment with this group is very concerning,” said Sarah Roberts, the company’s head of Military and Veteran Programs.Unlike students, many of whom choose their majors, a majority of people enlisted in the military are assigned their tasks and points of focus. When they leave, many veterans are eager to shift gears but lack clear pathways to do so.“About 55 percent of vets in transition want to do something totally different than what they did in the military,” Ms. Roberts said. Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has put together several programs to help place veterans in jobs, concede this is among the chief obstacles.

Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has put together several programs to help place veterans in jobs, concede this is among the chief obstacles. Veterans, particularly those without college degrees, are often pushed toward low-skill jobs even though their training and the culture of the military might well translate into other types of positions. A clear pipeline to those jobs, however, does not exist for veterans.“The employers are saying ‘It’s not our job to train them,’” said Joan Lynch, the chief content and programming officer at WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign that focuses on labor in the United States. “So whose job is it to train veterans for the work force? The military? No; they teach them to defend our nation. Employers aren’t doing it, either.”Many jobs require licenses and training for skills that veterans learned in combat, particularly in health care. Many veterans who acquired deep knowledge and specialized emergency response techniques, for example, would have no immediate access to the long credentialing process to become a physician assistant.Ms. Lynch said she had encountered many returning medics who were unable to immediately translate their skills into jobs — even when they had privately tutored medical residents on skills like suturing — because they lacked a license. At the same time, those extensive experiences may not apply in other, often lower-wage jobs for which they are vastly overqualified.“These people have about $1 million of training that the government has put into them,” Ms. Lynch said. “But they don’t have one credit toward a professional degree, and they end up being turned down for jobs delivering dry cleaning. It breaks your heart.”Under the most recent Defense Department budget bill, Congress authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess a possible partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems in which veterans can earn credit toward a master’s degree in physician assistant studies for their military operational work and medic training.Dr. David W. Callaway, an emergency physician at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., started a program in 2015 to teach veterans to translate their military medical training for civilian hospital settings.

His team spearheaded a partnership among Atrium Health, Wake Forest School of Medicine and the Defense Department to create a program that allows Special Operations combat medics to earn master’s degree credit toward a physician assistant license while serving in operational units.The program relied on private donor funding, even a local high school fund-raiser. Congress has authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess scaling the partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems.State governments, however, are best equipped to take on this issue, experts say.“We need to reform the occupational licensing laws,” said Rebecca Burgess, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “This could help veterans and military spouses whose unemployment rates have skyrocketed.”Indeed, the unemployment rate for military spouses is 24 percent, in large part because of frequent relocations and an inability to transfer occupational licenses from state to state. Last year, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona signed a bill to recognize out-of-state licenses in many areas to permit workers to become licensed in Arizona without additional training or education.Veterans leave the military with educational benefits coveted by most American high school students. In addition to the G.I. Bill, which provides 36 months of tuition payments and housing allowances, veterans have many other programs to draw on, such as an additional nine months of subsidized education for those pursuing STEM-related degrees and extensive new transition training programs.“Because of all these programs, veterans are better equipped to reach the American dream than their nonveteran counterparts,” said Margarita Devlin, the principal deputy under secretary for benefits at the Department of Veterans Affairs.But there are often complications, especially for those who have served for many years and now have families to support.

"It was the question that followed former Mayor Pete Buttigieg everywhere he went when he first announced his presidential campaign: Is the country really ready to send a gay man to the White House?But soon, it seemed, the novelty wore off. Many saw that as a sign of progress: Part of the reason his campaign was such a big deal, they said, was that it wasn’t a big deal what his sexual orientation was.Instead, other questions arose around Mr. Buttigieg’s prospects of winning. What does the mayor of the small Midwestern city of South Bend, Ind., know about being president? Why isn’t he connecting in a more significant way with African-American voters? Would he be able to unify the fractured Democratic Party? Some gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender activists, many of them young and nonwhite and far to the left of Mr. Buttigieg, started to ask whether he really represented their interests.In certain progressive circles, in online commentary and in much of the national media, the history-making aspect of Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign often warranted only a passing and perfunctory mention. And the sprawling, diverse Democratic field featured plenty of other potential firsts, including six women, one of them African-American, a Latino man and two Jewish men.

But many, especially those who have fought for L.G.B.T. equality for decades and have seen society grow more tolerant but not entirely accepting, say that Mr. Buttigieg’s contribution to history will be misunderstood and diminished if the main takeaway is that the first openly gay man to have a serious shot at the presidency elicited a collective shrug from a country, as if the country had moved on from its homophobic past.Roberta Kaplan, who argued the 2013 Supreme Court case that overturned a federal law limiting recognition of marriage to heterosexual couples, Windsor v. United States, said in a tweet last week shortly after Mr. Buttigieg ended his campaign that she was still in awe that he got as far as he did.If you had asked her seven years ago whether an openly gay candidate could credibly run for president in 2020, she wrote on Twitter, “I would have said you were nuts.” In an interview a few days later, Ms. Kaplan said she was still just as struck by Mr. Buttigieg’s success. But just as surprising, she said, is “that there’s a failure to understand history — and a very recent history.”“On the one hand, people over-assume acceptance and equality. And on the other hand, there is no question the L.G.B.T.Q. movement has achieved equality at a speed that probably no other modern movement has,” Ms. Kaplan added. “And those things kind of have to live in tension.” But many, especially those who have fought for L.G.B.T. equality for decades and have seen society grow more tolerant but not entirely accepting, say that Mr. Buttigieg’s contribution to history will be misunderstood and diminished if the main takeaway is that the first openly gay man to have a serious shot at the presidency elicited a collective shrug from a country, as if the country had moved on from its homophobic past.Roberta Kaplan, who argued the 2013 Supreme Court case that overturned a federal law limiting recognition of marriage to heterosexual couples, Windsor v.

One was the reality of certain progressive activists, rival Democrats, social media and many of the reporters who covered him, which was focused on why he shouldn’t or couldn’t win the nomination, his supporters said. Mr. Buttigieg felt that tension constantly during his campaign, existing in between what were essentially two realities. One was the reality of certain progressive activists, rival Democrats, social media and many of the reporters who covered him, which was focused on why he shouldn’t or couldn’t win the nomination, his supporters said. “The too-isms always followed him,” said Tom Sheridan, a consultant in Washington who has worked with Congress to expand legal protections for people with AIDS and disabilities. “He was too young, too straight-acting, too boring, too inexperienced because he was mayor of a city that was too small.”To many who felt a sense of empowerment from his campaign, though, those misgivings felt disconnected from their reality.Mr. Buttigieg described the gratitude and optimism he often encountered when he was traveling the country, and acknowledged it was so powerful it took him aback at first. “Even I thought, ‘OK, maybe this is not all that much of an event,’” he said in an interview last year.Strangers would approach him and try to convey how much it meant to see someone so public and so prominent talk about his experience as an L.G.B.T. person. One was just 9, a boy in Denver who told Mr. Buttigieg at a rally a few days before he dropped out of the race, “I want to be brave like you,” and asked, “Would you help me tell the world I’m gay, too?”Sometimes they were much older, like the flight attendant who was so overcome with emotion when he encountered Mr. Buttigieg at an airport that he was unable to speak. “He just made eye contact and came to the point of tears,” Mr. Buttigieg recalled. “And then walked off not knowing what else to do.”Even in 2020, part of the paradox of running a successful campaign as an openly gay man meant that his orientation could not define him to voters who might not fully accept it. He understood this, and ran his campaign in a way that always sought equilibrium. The protective armor against his sexual orientation seemed in many ways to be his résumé. He was “Mayor Pete” the Rhodes Scholar, Navy veteran, pianist and technocrat conversant in eight languages. “The too-isms always followed him,” said Tom Sheridan, a consultant in Washington who has worked with Congress to expand legal protections for people with AIDS and disabilities. “He was too young, too straight-acting, too boring, too inexperienced because he was mayor of a city that was too small.”To many who felt a sense of empowerment from his campaign, though, those misgivings felt disconnected from their reality.Mr. Buttigieg described the gratitude and optimism he often encountered when he was traveling the country, and acknowledged it was so powerful it took him aback at first. “Even I thought, ‘OK, maybe this is not all that much of an event,’” he said in an interview last year.Strangers would approach him and try to convey how much it meant to see someone so public and so prominent talk about his experience as an L.G.B.T. person.

In this sense, he too is responsible for the way his sexual orientation was downplayed.But the backlash he faced from fellow Democrats and liberal activists limited his ability to control his campaign’s narrative — a reality of presidential politics that is hardly unique to him. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s early days as a candidate, for instance, were dominated not by questions over her proposed wealth tax or other policy initiatives she wanted to discuss but over her claims of Native American heritage.Mr. Buttigieg had to answer tough criticism from African-American residents of South Bend who said they felt marginalized and neglected. And as he acknowledged, his explanations weren’t always sufficient.These criticisms made him seem like a poor fit for a generation of younger liberals who are deeply concerned about issues of racial justice and inequality. Progressives said they felt he didn’t speak for them; they sometimes heckled him at his events.

Many of his defenders said the media and other Democrats focused too aggressively on his inability to attract more support from black voters, a problem other candidates like Ms. Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar faced.“Why was Pete singled out for a problem that other candidates were having?” said Joel Benenson, the Democratic strategist and pollster who worked for the Obama and Hillary Clinton campaigns and whose firm consulted for Mr. Buttigieg. Mr. Benenson pointed out that even after Mr. Buttigieg came in first in the delegate count in the Iowa caucuses and a close second place to Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire, large percentages of the country still did not know much about him, making judgments about his inability to attract entire demographics premature.After Iowa, he was viewed more favorably than unfavorably in a poll of registered voters nationwide by Quinnipiac University. (This was not true for Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, the poll found.) But almost a third of those surveyed said they had not heard enough about him to form an opinion.

And he’s not even nationally known,” Mr. Benenson added, which is an achievement he said was also glossed over.His supporters also argued that skeptics placed an unfair focus on how Mr. Buttigieg would perform in South Carolina, turning a small, conservative and highly religious state into a definitive proxy for his support among African-American voters nationwide. They also pointed to some statewide polling that indicated voters there would find it difficult to vote for an L.G.B.T. presidential candidate. “We have a long ways to go in the South and with the church,” said Rev. T. Anthony Spearman, president of the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. and a proponent of L.G.B.T. rights. Asked if he thought an openly gay or lesbian person could be elected president, Mr. Spearman said yes. “With Mayor Pete, I think down the road we’ll see how much of an impact his running will affect us.” Asked if Mr. Buttigieg could have won his state, Mr. Spearman said he wasn’t so sure.Though first-of-their-kind campaigns often fall short, they can make progress in other ways. Robert Raben, a Democratic consultant who works on liberal causes and diversity initiatives, likened Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign to the moment in 1984 when Jesse Jackson stood onstage with his family at the Democratic National Convention. He had run for and lost the Democratic nomination that year, and yet his speech was watched by some 33 million viewers.“You saw a black nuclear family that could have been in the White House,” Mr. Raben said. “It went from the abstract to the concrete.” With the idea of a gay couple living in the White House, Mr. Raben added, “Buttigieg brought us from the abstract to the concrete.”While the question of whether the country is ready to send a gay man to the White House remains unanswered, the question of whether Americans will treat one seriously as a presidential candidate is now closed, he said. “And we’ll never have to have that conversation again.” “This guy, a mayor of a city of 100,000 people, was coming in first and second.

"WASHINGTON — After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump administration about the coronavirus, the government’s top health officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt about the dangers of the outbreak.If he approved, they would level with the public.But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan. At noon on Feb. 25, just as Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home, she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States was about to change.“The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said. Schools might have to close, conferences could be canceled, businesses might make employees work from home. She had told her own children, she said, to prepare for “significant disruption to our lives.” WASHINGTON — After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump administration about the coronavirus, the government’s top health officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt about the dangers of the outbreak.If he approved, they would level with the public.But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan.

The stock market plummeted, cable news blared apocalyptic headlines and by the time Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews early the next morning, his critics were accusing him of sowing confusion on an issue of life or death. The president immediately got on the phone with Alex M. Azar II, his secretary of health and human services. That call scared people, he shouted, referring to Ms. Messonnier’s warnings. Are we at the point that we will have to start closing schools? the president added, alarmed, according to an official who heard about the call.To health officials, the message needed to change with the outbreak. “The epicenter was shifting” as the number of new cases outside China surpassed those inside, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C. “The issue of what this might mean to us became more important.”From the beginning, the Trump administration’s attempts to forestall an outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth. Even as the government’s scientists and leading health experts raised the alarm early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance and doubt at the White House — especially from the president — about spooking financial markets and inciting panic.“It’s going to all work out,” Mr. Trump said as recently as Thursday night. “Everybody has to be calm.

Clear, honest communication is also crucial, and the United States has at times criticized China and other governments for being less than transparent.

Redfield, the C.D.C.’s director, called to tell him China had potentially discovered a new coronavirus. Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive who helped manage the response to earlier SARS and anthrax outbreaks, told his chief of staff to make sure that the National Security Council was aware.This is a very big deal, Mr. Azar told him.The Trump administration had eliminated the global health unit that had been part of the National Security Council, but within days, a team was meeting daily in the basement of the West Wing, pleading with Chinese officials to allow doctors from the C.D.C. into their country.For weeks, the Chinese refused offers of public health cooperation. “China nice-talked it for a month,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security who was working on the coronavirus effort. “‘Oh, well, thank you for the offer. Blah, blah.’”On Saturday, Jan. 18, a day after the C.D.C. dispatched 100 people to three American airports to screen travelers coming from Wuhan, China, Mr. Azar made his first call to Mr. Trump about the virus, dialing him directly at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. The president insisted on talking about e-cigarettes first, but Mr. Azar steered him to the virus. Mr. Azar was at his home in suburban Washington, on Friday, Jan. 3, when Dr. Robert R.

Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.“We have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.“We have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” On the evening of Jan. 28, a new kind of crisis broke out in the skies.The State Department had ordered the evacuation of the American Consulate in Wuhan and a 747 was in the air. But as it headed for the United States with hundreds of passengers who possibly carried the virus, administration officials in Washington were in a frantic scramble about where it should land.Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, tried to secure some kind of military base in California, but was struggling to cut through Pentagon red tape. In a panic, his staff started booking hundreds of rooms at three hotels in the Los Angeles area, asking for full floors so they could separate potentially infected evacuees from other guests.One idea was to land the plane at the Ontario airport outside Los Angeles, and officials went so far as to schedule, then cancel, a briefing for some members of the California congressional delegation. After hours of wrangling, and with the plane still in the air, Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, said the plane could land at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, which had space to house all of the passengers.Inside the White House, a debate broke out, centered on concerns that had become ever-present since the virus first emerged: How would the government’s actions be perceived by the public? And what would the president think?At issue was whether to impose a federal quarantine order on the evacuees to prevent them from leaving for 14 days. Such authority had not been used since a smallpox outbreak in 1969. But officials had to find some way to make sure the passengers did not leave the base until it was clear they were not infected.

One woman balked, so California officials, who use quarantine authority more often, stepped in and forced the passengers to stay.Time to Provoke China? By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day. Any one of them could be the trigger for a new and undetected American outbreak.Over four days in the White House Situation Room, the nation’s top public health and national security officials engaged in a fierce debate over whether to take the extraordinary step of banning travel from China.Public health officials were initially wary. Experts have long recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it is often ineffective and can stymie the response by limiting the movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain the disease. A ban would anger China, they worried, ending any hope of cooperation with American medical teams.Officials at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security argued that China had already proved unwilling to cooperate. A third group inside the White House was worried that the move would incite panic and could roil the financial markets.By Thursday, Jan. 30, the public health officials had come around. Mr. Azar, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic’s center could buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. “There was so much we didn’t know about this virus,” Dr. Redfield said in an interview. “We were rapidly understanding it was much more transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.” By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day.

Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?The president sided with his more aggressive aides, and announced the ban next day.Still, Mr. Trump was publicly upbeat about the effects of the virus. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, “By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government’s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation’s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the administration that it was quickly being resolved.Americans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States.

At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, “By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government’s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation’s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the administration that it was quickly being resolved.Americans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States. The month ended with a whistle-blower’s claim that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in California without the personal protective gear that is required for anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients. None of the workers tested positive for the virus, but the allegation shook Congress.‘I Like the Numbers Being Where They Are.’ The month ended with a whistle-blower’s claim that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in California without the personal protective gear that is required for anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients.

As Mr. Biden now attempts to leverage his Super Tuesday success and build momentum, Mr. Sanders may face even longer odds in Michigan than he did in 2016. The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him. Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state.

Recognizing the stakes here, Mr. Sanders is assailing Mr. Biden for his support of what he called “disastrous trade agreements like Nafta.” And his campaign is airing a commercial in the manufacturing-heavy state that features a former autoworker highlighting the former vice president’s lack of regret for supporting the pact while pointing out that Mr. Sanders has opposed free trade deals.As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.

Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said former Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.” Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary.

Ms. Whitmer, Ms. Slotkin and Ms. Stevens all threw their support behind Mr. Biden this past week.

In an acknowledgment that his campaign would be grievously wounded if he did not rebound in Michigan, Mr. Sanders canceled an event scheduled for Mississippi, which also votes Tuesday, to spend more time here. And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals.It is clear why Mr. Sanders is scrambling — the Super Tuesday results carried ominous signs for his candidacy. In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.

Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest. In suburban Oakland County, for example, Mrs. Clinton won by about five points in 2016. But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state. He said, “everybody in my circle is coalescing around Joe Biden.”At first, he said, black and white voters alike were “looking for President Obama — but instead we went with the one we’ve always felt comfortable with.”Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Dearborn, Mich.

His mother lost their house that she had fought to keep after his father’s suicide, and she and her two sons had to move in with Mr. Michelz’s grandparents.That year, when Mr. Michelz was 18, he took a part-time job cleaning out houses after they had been foreclosed on. He saw closets stuffed with cherished possessions — photographs, prom dresses, watches — and threw these things into dumpsters. Once, a man begged him to open the door so he could retrieve his belongings.It was a searing experience and the beginning of his political education.“When I hear Bernie’s forgiving debt and people say, ‘It’s way too expensive,’ I think, you did the craziest thing for the banks,” he said of the bailouts. “Yet normal families were thrown in the street, literally.”He continued: “The middle finger was given to our family, while the rich guys got off scot-free.” “It was like everything was for sale,” he said. “I always thought reality TV shows were really embarrassing.

He started paying more attention to the news. He was spending a lot of time online and started looking up things he had heard, like the line from the protesters at Occupy Wall Street that the top 1 percent of Americans had more wealth than close to half of the rest of the country.“At first I thought it couldn’t be true,” he said. “It just didn’t make sense.”It was around this time he first saw Mr. Sanders — on his grandparents’ TV talking about health care. Mr. Michelz looked him up and saw that he had been saying the same thing for years. He liked what he heard. He thought about his $24,000 in medical debt and how arbitrary it seemed.

As for the economy, nothing made sense. He spent years in college classes learning teaching, but ended up working in a tire store because it paid better. He went to college, just like everybody said he should, but is now working in a job that does not require a degree.Mr. Sanders seemed to be telling him why his life looked and felt the way it did. His financial instability was not some individual failure, but a function of a broader economic system that had become so unequal that fixing it was a moral calling.What Mr. Sanders proposed “was creating the conditions to make people’s lives less stressful,” he said.And as for the arguments against Mr. Sanders — all these things he wanted would cost too much and would cause economic chaos and people to suffer — that was already happening, he thought. Domestic violence, families breaking apart, children not getting the care they needed — the common thread was the economic system.The fact that Mr. Sanders was rejected by the establishment merely proved his worth for Mr. Michelz.“I knew it was OK to be hated by the mainstream,” he said.So on March 8, 2016, he rode to the polling station in Yale with his grandfather. Rush Limbaugh was on the radio. When they walked inside, he voted for Mr. Sanders and his grandfather voted for Mr. Trump. It was his first time voting, but he does not remember feeling much of anything.“I just thought, I’m going to at least put my voice in a direction, even if no one hears it,” he said.

Mr. Michelz never considered voting for Mr. Trump, finding him unappealing and bothered by his stance on climate change. But he does not hate him. Some of the people he loves most voted for him. He understands why.“The truth is, they are speaking to a frustrated America,” Mr. Michelz said of political candidates. “That’s why someone who is as ridiculous as Trump got elected. People wanted to see someone who wasn’t proper, who wasn’t afraid of the establishment. He appealed to people who thought it was all becoming a sham.”He added: “It’s the same thing with Bernie.”A few months later, Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee.In November, he did not vote. Looking back, he does not regret it.This NovemberFour years later, he has even more at stake.Mr. Michelz is now married. After years of blocking out his ruined credit score, he cares a lot about it. He still cannot get a loan, which means leasing a new car is out of the question. He wants badly to buy one with heated seats for Sarah. Instead they are stuck with their old models. He recently poured $3,000 in bonuses from his job at the tire shop into his car.Sometimes Mr. Michelz worries about not providing enough for his family.“I think about Sarah,” he said. “She’s around doctors every day. Does she ever have a thought, ‘I could be with someone who makes way more money?’ I know that’s irrational. On the one hand I’m bothered by it. But on the other, I know I’m giving 110 percent.”So, he tries to show her every day that he loves her. He often buys her flowers. Last Thursday, a small vase in the kitchen held two carnations and a rose. Mr. Michelz never considered voting for Mr. Trump, finding him unappealing and bothered by his stance on climate change.

This year he found that he loved Andrew Yang.“To me, he made Bernie seem outdated,” he said. When Mr. Yang dropped out, “I was bummed, but I was happy, too. His message got out there.”He feels wiser now. He no longer believes the American story that everyone should be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.“That’s a big lie that benefits the rich and keeps the system the same,” he said.He will still vote for Mr. Sanders, though he knows it is a long shot.“Even if it doesn’t work, I’m going to throw my vote that way,” Mr. Michelz said. “I have nothing to lose.” All of this has brought him back to politics, which he now knows is the thread that runs through many of these problems.

"WASHINGTON — Erik Prince, the security contractor with close ties to the Trump administration, has in recent years helped recruit former American and British spies for secretive intelligence-gathering operations that included infiltrating Democratic congressional campaigns, labor organizations and other groups considered hostile to the Trump agenda, according to interviews and documents.One of the former spies, an ex-MI6 officer named Richard Seddon, helped run a 2017 operation to copy files and record conversations in a Michigan office of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers’ unions in the nation. Mr. Seddon directed an undercover operative to secretly tape the union’s local leaders and try to gather information that could be made public to damage the organization, documents show.Using a different alias the next year, the same undercover operative infiltrated the congressional campaign of Abigail Spanberger, then a former C.I.A. officer who went on to win an important House seat in Virginia as a Democrat. The campaign discovered the operative and fired her.Both operations were run by Project Veritas, a conservative group that has gained attention using hidden cameras and microphones for sting operations on news organizations, Democratic politicians and liberal advocacy groups. Mr. Seddon’s role in the teachers’ union operation — detailed in internal Project Veritas emails that have emerged from the discovery process of a court battle between the group and the union — has not previously been reported, nor has Mr. Prince’s role in recruiting Mr. Seddon for the group’s activities.

Both Project Veritas and Mr. Prince have ties to President Trump’s aides and family. Whether any Trump administration officials or advisers to the president were involved in the operations, even tacitly, is unclear. But the effort is a glimpse of a vigorous private campaign to try to undermine political groups or individuals perceived to be in opposition to Mr. Trump’s agenda.Mr. Prince, the former head of Blackwater Worldwide and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has at times served as an informal adviser to Trump administration officials. He worked with the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn during the presidential transition. In 2017, he met with White House and Pentagon officials to pitch a plan to privatize the Afghan war using contractors in lieu of American troops. Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, rejected the idea.Mr. Prince appears to have become interested in using former spies to train Project Veritas operatives in espionage tactics sometime during the 2016 presidential campaign. Reaching out to several intelligence veterans — and occasionally using Mr. Seddon to make the pitch — Mr. Prince said he wanted the Project Veritas employees to learn skills like how to recruit sources and how to conduct clandestine recordings, among other surveillance techniques.James O’Keefe, the head of Project Veritas, declined to answer detailed questions about Mr. Prince, Mr. Seddon and other topics, but he called his group a “proud independent news organization” that is involved in dozens of investigations. He said that numerous sources were coming to the group “providing confidential documents, insights into internal processes and wearing hidden cameras to expose corruption and misconduct.” Both Project Veritas and Mr. Prince have ties to President Trump’s aides and family.

A spokesman for Mr. Prince declined to comment. Emails sent to Mr. Seddon went unanswered.Mr. Prince is under investigation by the Justice Department over whether he lied to a congressional committee examining Russian interference in the 2016 election, and for possible violations of American export laws. Last year, the House Intelligence Committee made a criminal referral to the Justice Department about Mr. Prince, saying he lied about the circumstances of his meeting with a Russian banker in the Seychelles in January 2017.Once a small operation running on a shoestring budget, Project Veritas in recent years has had a surge in donations from both private donors and conservative foundations. According to its latest publicly available tax filing, Project Veritas received $8.6 million in contributions and grants in 2018. Mr. O’Keefe earned about $387,000.Last year, the group received a $1 million contribution made through the law firm Alston & Bird, a financial document obtained by The New York Times showed. A spokesman for the firm said that Alston & Bird “has never contributed to Project Veritas on its own behalf, nor is it a client of ours.” The spokesman declined to say on whose behalf the contribution was made.The financial document also listed the names of others who gave much smaller amounts to Project Veritas last year. Several of them confirmed their donations.The group has also become intertwined with the political activities of Mr. Trump and his family. The Trump Foundation gave $20,000 to Project Veritas in 2015, the year that Mr. Trump began his bid for the presidency. The next year, during a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump claimed without substantiation that videos released by Mr. O’Keefe showed that Mrs. Clinton and President Barack Obama had paid people to incite violence at rallies for Mr. Trump.In a book published in 2018, Mr. O’Keefe wrote that Mr. Trump years earlier had encouraged him to infiltrate Columbia University and obtain Mr. Obama’s records.Last month, Project Veritas made public secretly recorded video of a longtime ABC News correspondent who was critical of the network’s political coverage and its emphasis on business considerations over journalism.

Mr. O’Keefe and others shared social media photos of taking target practice with guns at the ranch, including one post from Mr. O’Keefe saying that with the training, Project Veritas will be “the next great intelligence agency.” Mr. Prince had hired a former MI6 officer to help train the Project Veritas operatives, The Intercept wrote, but it did not identify the officer.Mr. Seddon regularly updated Mr. O’Keefe about the operation against the Michigan teachers’ union, according to internal Project Veritas emails, where the language of the group’s leaders is marbled with spy jargon.They used a code name — LibertyU — for their operative inside the organization, Marisa Jorge, who graduated from Liberty University in Virginia, one of the nation’s largest Christian colleges. Mr. Seddon wrote that Ms. Jorge “copied a great many documents from the file room,” and Mr. O’Keefe bragged that the group would be able to get “a ton more access agents inside the educational establishment.”The emails refer to other operations, including weekly case updates, along with training activities that involved “operational targeting.” Project Veritas redacted specifics about those operations from the messages.In August 2017, Ms. Jorge wrote to Mr. Seddon that she had managed to record a local union leader talking about Ms. DeVos and other topics.“Good stuff,” Mr. Seddon wrote back. “Did you receive the spare camera yet?”As education secretary, Ms. DeVos has been a vocal critic of teachers’ unions, saying in 2018 that they have a “stranglehold” over politicians at the federal and state levels. She and Mr. Prince grew up in Michigan, where their father made a fortune in the auto parts business.AFT Michigan sued Project Veritas in federal court, alleging trespassing, eavesdropping and other offenses. The teachers’ union is asking for more than $3 million in damages, accusing the group of being a “vigilante organization which claims to be dedicated to exposing corruption.

Mr. Halderman was copied on several messages providing updates about the Michigan operation, and in one message, he gave instructions to Ms. Jorge. Project Veritas tax filings list Mr. Halderman as a “project manager.”Two other employees, Gaz Thomas and Samuel Chamberlain, were also identified in emails and appeared to play important roles in the Michigan operation. Efforts to locate Mr. Thomas were unsuccessful. A man named Samuel Chamberlain who matched the description of the one employed by Mr. O’Keefe denied he worked for Project Veritas. He did not respond to follow-up phone messages or an email.Last year, Project Veritas submitted a proposed list of witnesses for the trial over the lawsuit. Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Thomas were on the list. Mr. Seddon was not.Ms. Jorge, 23, did not respond to email addresses associated with her Liberty University account. In an archived version of her LinkedIn page, Ms. Jorge wrote she had a deep interest in the conservative movement and hoped one day to serve on the Supreme Court after attending law school.In a YouTube video, Mr. O’Keefe described the lawsuit as “frivolous” and pointed to a portion of the deposition in which David Hecker, the president of AFT Michigan, said that one of the goals of the lawsuit was to “stop Project Veritas from doing the kind of work that it does.”Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement: “Let’s be clear who the wrongdoer is here: Project Veritas used a fake intern to lie her way into our Michigan office, to steal documents and to spy — and they got caught.

At the time, Ms. Spanberger was running to unseat a sitting Republican congressman in a race both parties considered important for control of the House. Ms. Jorge was eventually exposed and kicked out of the campaign office.It was unclear whether Mr. Seddon was involved in planning that operation.Mr. Seddon was a longtime British intelligence officer who served around the world, including in Washington in the years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He is married to an American diplomat, Alice Seddon, who is serving in the American consulate in Lagos, Nigeria.Mr. O’Keefe and his group have taken aim at targets over the years including Planned Parenthood, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Democracy Partners, a group that consults with liberal and progressive electoral causes. In 2016, a Project Veritas operative infiltrated Democracy Partners using a fake name and fabricated résumé and made secret recordings of the staff. The year after the sting, Democracy Partners sued Project Veritas, and its lawyers have since deposed Mr. O’Keefe.In that deposition, Mr. O’Keefe defended the group’s undercover tactics, saying they were part of a long tradition of investigative journalism going back to muckraking reporters like Upton Sinclair. “I’m not ashamed of the methods that we use or the recordings that we use,” he said.He was asked whether he had provided any of the group’s secret recordings of Democracy Partners to the Republican National Committee or any member of the Trump family.

He said that he did not think so.In 2010, Mr. O’ Keefe and three others pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor after admitting they entered a government building in New Orleans under false pretenses as part of a sting.Kitty Bennett contributed research.",Erik Prince Recruits Ex-Spies to Help Infiltrate Liberal Groups,2020-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/erik-prince-project-veritas.html,new_york_times

Reince Priebus, John F. Kelly and Mick Mulvaney each tried to navigate Mr. Trump’s harum-scarum West Wing in his own way, alternately trying to control, channel or enable the advice-resistant president, only to eventually fall out of favor. Mr. Meadows has an advantage none of them did in that he has been a political confidant and ardent champion for much longer before taking the job and many in Mr. Trump’s circle were encouraged by his ascension. But he has never been tested like this before.“The president hasn’t gone through four chiefs of staff in three and a half years because he’s trying to figure out how to govern,” said Chris Whipple, the author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of those who served in the role. “He’s gone through four chiefs because he’s not interested in governing. He lives to campaign — to divide, demonize and disrupt — not to get things done.” Reince Priebus, John F.

A former real estate developer turned conservative bomb-thrower, Mr. Meadows made his name as a disrupter of the system, clashing repeatedly with House Republican leaders over spending, immigration and other issues, and inciting the rebellion that forced Speaker John A. Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded. He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor, on the floor during a contentious vote. In that sense, then, Mr. Meadows may make sense.

Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.“It’s a great move by the president,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows’s appointment. “Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he’s a great wartime consigliere and we’re heading into election season. Mark understands the president’s electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.”While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump’s racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings’s memorial service that talked about the value of the “unexpected friendship.”“I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,” Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. “We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he’s someone who makes things about policy and not people.”Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows’s policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. “I don’t see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,” she said. “I don’t think that’s possible. And if he thinks that’s possible, he’s probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.”Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described “fat nerd” and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate.

Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. “2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,” he said that year. He later called it “probably a poor choice of words on my part,” and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in “American Carnage.”Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the “Access Hollywood” tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta’s book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman — so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. “Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,” former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. “They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.”Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.

But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president. At one point early last year, during testimony by Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump’s.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to “actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.” Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows “one of my best friends,” and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president’s defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump’s camp. “My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,” he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney’s corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.“Mark is always up for the challenge,” Mr. Gaetz said. “We all knew when Mark wasn’t running for re-election that he didn’t lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it’s no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.” But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump will skip the annual bipartisan St. Patrick’s Day luncheon hosted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill this week, White House officials said Sunday, the latest in a series of tit-for-tat snubs between the two most powerful leaders in the nation’s capital.In rejecting Ms. Pelosi’s invitation, Mr. Trump becomes the first president to miss the event since George W. Bush when he was on the verge of war with Iraq in 2003. But Mr. Trump’s aides made no effort to disguise the reason behind the decision, openly attributing it to the president’s unhappiness with the speaker, who led the drive that resulted in his impeachment in the House in December.“Since the speaker has chosen to tear this nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the president will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.Instead, Mr. Trump will host Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland at the White House on Thursday for his own celebration of the holiday and friendship.

When he arrived at the Capitol for his State of the Union address last month, near the end of his Senate trial, Mr. Trump refused to shake Ms. Pelosi’s hand, as was customary, and she ripped up her copy of his speech after he delivered it.The day after the Senate acquitted him, also largely along party lines, Mr. Trump attended the National Prayer Breakfast with Ms. Pelosi. As she sat only a few feet away, he made a barely veiled attack on her faith, branding her as hypocritical for saying she prays for him. He told the clerics in the audience that he did not “like people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that’s not so.”The St. Patrick’s Day lunch traces its history to 1983, when President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, and Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill, a Democrat from Massachusetts, both of Irish descent, established the tradition. It became an annual affair in 1987, and only four times since then have presidents missed it.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Defending against criticism of his handling of the coronavirus, President Trump suggested the other day that he could hardly have been expected to be ready for such an unexpected crisis.“Who would have thought?” he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nerve center for the government’s response to the outbreak. “Who would have thought we would even be having the subject?”Actually, quite a few people would have thought, and did — including the officials in his own White House who were in charge of preparing for just such a pandemic only to have their office shut down in a reorganization in 2018. “The threat of pandemic flu is the No. 1 health security concern,” one of the officials said the day before that happened two years ago. “Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.”For a president who lives in the moment, rarely planning too far ahead, the coronavirus has proved to be a leadership challenge he was not prepared for either.

V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!” After initially brushing off warnings by his health secretary as “alarmist,” Mr. Trump in the last two weeks has taken a more assertive public role on the coronavirus, assigning Vice President Mike Pence to lead the government efforts and making multiple appearances to signal that he takes the threat seriously.But he has also taken a business-as-usual approach to the rest of his schedule, refusing to cancel campaign rallies, fund-raisers or social events even as other large gatherings of Americans are scrubbed. Asked by a reporter on Saturday night if he was worried that infections were getting closer to the White House, Mr. Trump said, “No, I’m not concerned at all.”The president then went inside Mar-a-Lago to host a lavish birthday party for the former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump Jr. and turns 51 on Monday, a preview perhaps of the celebration that may be held next month when Melania Trump turns 50. Among those spotted at the revelry were boldface names from Mr. Trump’s circle, including Mr. Pence, Lindsey Graham, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Tucker Carlson and Matt Gaetz.Mr. Trump happily introduced his visitor, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, to Mr. Carlson and other guests in a video shared on social media, boasting that he “gave him a good gift” by not imposing tariffs on Brazil and “that made him much more popular.” Mr. Bolsonaro laughed and agreed.

He has acknowledged that “I didn’t know people died from the flu” — tens of thousands, in fact, each year in the United States — even though, as The Washington Post pointed out, his own grandfather died of influenza during the 1918 epidemic.But he has credited himself with instinctive understanding of the science. “I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said at the C.D.C. on Friday. “People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”Mr. Trump rejected criticism of the slow distribution of test kits, framing it in terms evoking his battle against impeachment. “The tests are all perfect,” he told reporters, “like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right?” — a reference to the rough transcript of his telephone call with Ukraine’s president that led to his own impeachment for abuse of power.The president’s less-than-perfect pronouncements, however, left public health officials straining to reconcile them on the Sunday talk shows. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” about a White House aide’s assertion that the coronavirus had been “contained,” Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, said: “Well, this is a novel virus. It’s a new situation. And the messaging, quite frankly, is hard.” By the president’s own account, the coronavirus has been an education for him. He has acknowledged that “I didn’t know people died from the flu” — tens of thousands, in fact, each year in the United States — even though, as The Washington Post pointed out, his own grandfather died of influenza during the 1918 epidemic.But he has credited himself with instinctive understanding of the science. “I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said at the C.D.C. on Friday. “People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”Mr. Trump rejected criticism of the slow distribution of test kits, framing it in terms evoking his battle against impeachment. “The tests are all perfect,” he told reporters, “like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right?” — a reference to the rough transcript of his telephone call with Ukraine’s president that led to his own impeachment for abuse of power.The president’s less-than-perfect pronouncements, however, left public health officials straining to reconcile them on the Sunday talk shows. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” about a White House aide’s assertion that the coronavirus had been “contained,” Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, said: “Well, this is a novel virus. It’s a new situation. And the messaging, quite frankly, is hard.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to walk back the president’s claim that “anyone who wants a test can get a test,” saying on “Fox News Sunday” that it would actually be up to a doctor.Mr. Trump has become such a polarizing figure that even when he is not necessarily wrong, many do not trust him. On Sean Hannity’s Fox News show last week, he called the World Health Organization’s estimated fatality rate of 3.4 percent “a false number,” saying “my hunch” was that it would be under 1 percent. It sounded as if he were substituting his uneducated “hunch” for the judgment of professionals.But in fact, he was reflecting what he had been told by health experts, including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, who have concluded that once the full scope of unreported infections is known, the number of deaths will most likely represent a smaller share, possibly “considerably less than” 1 percent. The W.H.O. has also said the rate may fall.Still, at his appearance at the C.D.C., Mr. Trump had no explanation for why his White House shut down the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense established at the National Security Council in 2016 by President Barack Obama after the 2014 Ebola outbreak, stammering to suggest the coronavirus had been a surprise.“Well, I just don’t think — I just don’t think that somebody is going to — without seeing something, like we saw something happening in China,” Mr. Trump said. “As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially — not from the White House. I mean, you know, we don’t need a lab in the White House. But they saw something happening.”Elizabeth Cameron set up the global health security directorate at the White House for Mr. Obama before turning it over to Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, who ran it for Mr. Trump until May 2018, when he was pushed out and the directorate folded into other parts of the National Security Council. Had it still been around, it would have been charged with preparing for exactly the situation now facing the country.“I think it would have made a difference,” Ms. Cameron said on Sunday. “Monitoring and preparing for every eventuality and having a person and a directorate accountable for that is really important and could have been important in this case.”Chris Cameron contributed reporting from Washington.

The report said that Mr. Qahtani spent four or five days in the psychiatric unit of a hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, after an “acute psychotic break” and a suicide attempt in May 2000.Dr. Keram also wrote that Mr. Qahtani suffered a head injury in a car accident when he was a child and was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia. One symptom included hallucinations; he spoke to nonexistent people before he left Saudi Arabia and after his arrival at Guantánamo.Central to Judge Collyer’s order was the contention by Mr. Qahtani’s lawyers that Guantánamo was not equipped to handle his psychiatric illnesses, and that he was entitled to repatriation to culturally appropriate mental health care under the prisoner-of-war provisions in the Army regulations.The provisions give the board members access to both Mr. Qahtani and his clinical records.

"WASHINGTON — In a secure facility underneath the Capitol, members of Congress stopped by all last week to review two classified annexes to the Afghan peace accord with the Taliban that set the criteria for a critical element of the agreement: What constitutes enough “peace” for the United States to withdraw its forces?The Taliban have read the annexes.

And lawmakers who have paid the most attention to the peace plan also openly express frustration with the lack of a mechanism for verifying compliance that they believe Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had promised.At the core of the two documents, according to people familiar with their contents, is a timeline for what should happen over the next 18 months, what kinds of attacks are prohibited by both sides and, most important, how the United States will share information about its troop locations with the Taliban. While it may sound odd that the American military is sharing troop locations with its enemy of 18 years, the goal is to give the Taliban information that would allow it to prevent attacks during the withdrawal. Mr. Pompeo described the annexes last week as “military implementation documents.”That is part of it, but they appear to be much more.Because the documents lay out the specific understandings between the United States and the Taliban — including what bases would remain open under Afghan control — the details are critical to judging whether the United States is making good on its promise to leave only if conditions allow, or whether it is just getting out.The State Department has struggled to explain why the criteria for the terms, standards and thresholds for the American withdrawal could be known to the adversary but not to the American people or allies. In response to questions from The New York Times, the State Department issued a statement on Friday saying that the documents remained classified because “the movement of troops and operations against terrorists are sensitive matters.”“We do not want, for example, ISIS to know those details,” the statement added, referring to Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan.But another reason for the secrecy, according to several people familiar with the matter, is that the annexes leave the markers for peace remarkably vague, making it far from certain that the Taliban must convert into a counterterrorism force — as President Trump suggested a week ago — or that they are required to make complete peace with the elected government of President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan.

In fact, as written, they appear to give Mr. Trump, or his successor, enormous latitude to simply declare that the war is over and leave. But many of Mr. Trump’s aides suggest that American counterterrorism forces and a significant C.I.A. presence should remain in the country. How that will be resolved within the U.S. government, with the Taliban and with the Kabul government remains to be seen, and any resolution likely will prove difficult.

How that will be resolved within the U.S. government, with the Taliban and with the Kabul government remains to be seen, and any resolution likely will prove difficult. Many of the Republicans and Democrats who have taken the opportunity to review the documents say they are unimpressed.Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican and one of the sharpest critics of the accord, said before the agreement was signed last week, “Any deal that the United States would contemplate entering into with the Taliban should be made public in its entirety.”After reading the pact, including the classified annexes, Ms. Cheney said that the deal failed to provide mechanisms to verify that the Taliban was keeping the promises that Mr. Pompeo had described at the signing. “My concerns still remain,” she said, declining to describe the contents.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that the thresholds outlined in the annexes were “remarkably fuzzy” and that it was unclear how the United States would measure success.Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a senior State Department official in the Obama administration, posted a blistering message on Twitter last week about the annexes.

And it serves no national security purpose.”Lawmakers have voiced widespread unhappiness about Mr. Pompeo’s outreach on the subject. He called top members on the Senate and House committees dealing with foreign affairs last weekend to give them a cursory heads-up that the documents were coming to Congress, but lawmakers and their aides said they had not heard from him since.Days before the agreement was signed, Mr. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared to not know about — or seemed reluctant to discuss — the secret annexes.“Are you aware of any contemplation of any secret side deals with the Taliban?” Ms. Cheney asked on Feb. 26 during a House Armed Services Committee meeting.“Nothing, nothing comes to mind right now that you’re mentioning,” Mr. Esper replied.“You’re quoting things that I haven’t seen,” General Milley said.The annexes predominantly revolve around a committee to facilitate communication between the two parties to ensure commitments are being adhered to, according to officials who have read them. No details have come to light about the composition of that committee. “Bottom line: the administration is telling a terrorist group the conditions (such as they are) of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, but not telling the American people,” he wrote. “This is wrong.

He called top members on the Senate and House committees dealing with foreign affairs last weekend to give them a cursory heads-up that the documents were coming to Congress, but lawmakers and their aides said they had not heard from him since.Days before the agreement was signed, Mr. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared to not know about — or seemed reluctant to discuss — the secret annexes.“Are you aware of any contemplation of any secret side deals with the Taliban?” Ms. Cheney asked on Feb. 26 during a House Armed Services Committee meeting.“Nothing, nothing comes to mind right now that you’re mentioning,” Mr. Esper replied.“You’re quoting things that I haven’t seen,” General Milley said.The annexes predominantly revolve around a committee to facilitate communication between the two parties to ensure commitments are being adhered to, according to officials who have read them. No details have come to light about the composition of that committee. They describe the parameters for when it would and would not be appropriate to use force, including commitments from the Taliban not to attack American forces during a withdrawal. Over all, the annexes make up no more than a few pages, often with just one to two sentences laying out each component. For example, the Taliban are not to conduct suicide attacks, and the Americans forgo drone strikes — portions of the agreements that thus far have held.

For example, the Taliban are not to conduct suicide attacks, and the Americans forgo drone strikes — portions of the agreements that thus far have held. General Milley hinted in congressional testimony last week what scope and scale of attacks were not permitted under the agreement.“There is no attacks in 34 provincial capitals, there is no attacks in Kabul, there is no high-profile attacks, there is no suicide bombers, there is no vehicle-borne suicide, no attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition,” General Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, after reports that the Taliban had carried out attacks against Afghan security forces. “There is a whole laundry list of these things that aren’t happening.”In its statement, the State Department said the secret annexes were consistent with the public agreement. “The arrangements include specific commitments by all parties to efforts to continue to reduce violence until a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire is agreed in intra-Afghan negotiations, while preserving the right of all parties to self-defense,” it said. The United States has “a robust monitoring and verification mechanism” to track and assess the behavior of the Taliban, it added.But those who have seen the agreement said the specifics were so nebulous that they doubted the United States retained much leverage.“The documents provided none of the assurances that I felt like we heard from Secretary Pompeo and others about a rigorous process that was going to make sure we hold the Taliban accountable for their end of the deal,” said Representative Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, who served in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus.“I saw nothing in there that gives me any confidence” that those assurances are in place “beyond trusting the word of the Taliban,” he said. “This vague, thin package of documents is all we could actually get agreed to by the Taliban.

Moderate-leaning Democrats have rapidly coalesced behind Mr. Biden, whose campaign has been rolling out new endorsements seemingly nonstop in recent days.In a written statement about her endorsement, Ms. Harris noted the absence of a top female candidate in the primary. “Like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one,” she said, adding that “we find ourselves without any woman on a path to be the Democratic nominee for president.”“This is something we must reckon with and it is something I will have more to say about in the future,” Ms. Harris said. “But we must rise to unite the party and country behind a candidate who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who can ultimately defeat Donald Trump.”Ms. Harris announced her endorsement five days after Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden captured 10 of 14 states, and ahead of another round of contests on Tuesday in six states, including Michigan. Ms. Harris will join Mr. Biden at a rally in Detroit on Monday night.Ms. Harris ended her presidential bid in December, two months before the Iowa caucuses. Now, she is following several of her former rivals for the presidential nomination in getting behind Mr. Biden.

Mr. Sanders pointed on Sunday to Ms. Klobuchar’s and Mr. Buttigieg’s decisions to drop out as the reason he lost several key states to Mr. Biden on Super Tuesday. “The establishment put a great deal of pressure on Pete Buttigieg, on Amy Klobuchar, who ran really aggressive campaigns,” he told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If they had not withdrawn from the race before Super Tuesday, which is kind of a surprise to a lot of people, I suspect we would have won in Minnesota, we would have won in Maine, we would have won in Massachusetts.” For Ms. Harris, the decision to endorse Mr. Biden is particularly striking, because one of the biggest moments of her campaign was a forceful debate-stage exchange with him.“It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,” she said in June during the first Democratic debate.“And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,” she added. “And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.”The exchange gave her a lift in the polls and a temporary burst of momentum that she was not able to sustain. At a fund-raiser on Friday, Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, described Ms. Harris’s attack at the debate as a “punch to the gut.”Some of Ms. Harris’s advisers were privately frustrated that she endorsed Mr. Biden after California voted on Super Tuesday and when it was already clear that he had become the front-runner.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump moved on Monday to address the economic effects of the widening coronavirus crisis by announcing that he would work with Congress on tax cuts and other measures after the worst stock market drop in more than a decade.The president, who played down the virus threat earlier in the day, made an unscheduled evening appearance in the White House briefing room after two Republican members of Congress who have spent time with him in recent days, including one who just rode with him on Air Force One, put themselves into quarantine following exposure to the virus.Also putting himself into isolation was Mark Meadows, the president’s newly designated White House chief of staff. Mr. Meadows, who was named to the role only on Friday and is stepping down from his House seat representing North Carolina, came into contact with the same infected attendee as the other two congressmen at a recent conservative political conference. While he tested negative for the coronavirus, his office said, he would remain quarantined until Wednesday out of caution.While none of the three men have displayed symptoms, the threat of the virus coming so close to the president represented a new stage of the outbreak even as organizations across the country restricted travel and canceled gatherings. Mr. Trump made no mention of his own contacts with the affected lawmakers, but his spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, later said the president would not be tested “because he has neither had prolonged close contact” with confirmed patients “nor does he have any symptoms.” WASHINGTON — President Trump moved on Monday to address the economic effects of the widening coronavirus crisis by announcing that he would work with Congress on tax cuts and other measures after the worst stock market drop in more than a decade.The president, who played down the virus threat earlier in the day, made an unscheduled evening appearance in the White House briefing room after two Republican members of Congress who have spent time with him in recent days, including one who just rode with him on Air Force One, put themselves into quarantine following exposure to the virus.Also putting himself into isolation was Mark Meadows, the president’s newly designated White House chief of staff.

Mr. Trump made no mention of his own contacts with the affected lawmakers, but his spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, later said the president would not be tested “because he has neither had prolonged close contact” with confirmed patients “nor does he have any symptoms.” But clearly unsettled by the plunging markets and the potential effect on his re-election prospects, Mr. Trump offered an economic response without any new health measures.Speaking with reporters, he said he would meet on Tuesday with Republican congressional leaders to discuss a “very substantial” payroll tax cut and legislation to protect hourly wage earners who miss work because of the virus. He said he would also explore expanding loans by the Small Business Administration. He did not provide any details.“It’s not their fault,” he said of affected workers. “It’s not our country’s fault. This was something that we were thrown into and we’re going to handle it and we have been handling it very well.”He added, “The main thing is that we’re taking care of the American public and we will be taking care of the American public.”The developments came on one of the most jarring days of Mr. Trump’s presidency as markets plummeted, infections rose, schools and universities shut down classes and other nations imposed drastic travel restrictions. With individual lawmakers now heading into isolation, members of Congress contemplated whether it should recess altogether for the foreseeable future to guard against a further spread among the nation’s legislators.

The tension of the day was reflected on Air Force One as it made its way back to Washington from Florida. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, boarded the plane steps behind the president in Orlando, where Mr. Trump held a campaign fund-raiser, only to learn shortly after takeoff that he had been in contact with an infected person at a conservative conference late last month. He then essentially quarantined himself in the air, sitting alone in a compartment of the plane.

As the jet raced toward Washington, its television screens were tuned to Fox News showing the slow-motion progress of a cruise ship with 21 infected passengers heading to a port in Oakland, Calif., followed by overhead cameras under a “Virus Ship Watch” chyron, while a red box in the lower-left-hand corner showed the sinking Dow Jones industrial average, which finished the day down more than 2,000 points, or about 7 percent.Mr. Trump, who regularly invokes the market as an indicator of his success, on Twitter initially blamed the meltdown on falling oil prices and the news media even though most market analysts attributed the bulk of it to concern about the effect of the virus on the global economy. He made no mention of it when he met with reporters in the evening.He did praise his own decision last month to restrict entry to the United States by foreign citizens who had been to China in the previous 14 days.“The big decision was early when we shut down our borders,” he said, overstating the action he took. “We were the first ones ever to do that. We’ve never done that in our country before. We would have a situation that would be a lot more dire.”Mr. Trump has resisted canceling campaign rallies despite other large events being scrubbed, and a campaign aide said he would announce another one on Tuesday. But his campaign on Monday called off a “Women for Trump” bus tour featuring his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, and other top election surrogates, including Mercedes Schlapp, whose husband oversees the Conservative Political Action Conference, after which an attendee tested positive for the virus.That attendee came into contact with Mr. Meadows, Mr. Gaetz and at least three other Republican lawmakers who have now quarantined themselves. The tension of the day was reflected on Air Force One as it made its way back to Washington from Florida. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, boarded the plane steps behind the president in Orlando, where Mr. Trump held a campaign fund-raiser, only to learn shortly after takeoff that he had been in contact with an infected person at a conservative conference late last month. He then essentially quarantined himself in the air, sitting alone in a compartment of the plane.

Mr. Gaetz, who attended events with Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on Friday and Saturday night, met up with the president again on Monday at the Orlando fund-raiser. Mr. Trump then invited Mr. Gaetz to join him on Air Force One back to Washington.In an interview, Mr. Gaetz said that he received a phone call from his chief of staff as the plane was taking off telling him that a picture had been found of him with the infected conference attendee 11 days earlier, meaning he had potentially been exposed to the virus. He said he told John McEntee, a top White House official, and asked to be separated from the other passengers.“He walked me back to a room toward the rear of Air Force One,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I went in there by myself.” A physician traveling with the president then came back and told him that because he had no symptoms 11 days later, he probably had not contracted the virus. But Mr. Gaetz said he remained apart from the rest of the passengers for the rest of the flight.As Air Force One was landing, Mr. Trump summoned him to the front of the plane. “I would not go into his office,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I stood outside of it. He just wanted to see if I was all right, which I am.”He said the president used humor to lighten the situation. “He asked if I needed to be wrapped in cellophane,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I told him that I was willing to jump out of the plane without a parachute if necessary.” He added that he was tested after landing and expects his results back on Tuesday.Mr. Gaetz drew attention last week when he wore a bulky gas mask in the Capitol for the vote on an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus. Days later, a resident of his Florida district died from the coronavirus, prompting some to suggest that he had made light of the risks. Mr. Gaetz denied that, saying he was making a serious point about the risk to lawmakers who interact with so many people.

Mr. Collins was on the tarmac when Mr. Trump landed in Atlanta on Friday and shook the president’s hand before joining him on the tour of the C.D.C. “While I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution,” Mr. Collins wrote on his Twitter feed.

Mr. Meadows was told over the weekend that he, too, might have come into contact with the infected attendee but tested negative, his congressional office said in a statement. “While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,” the statement said.Mr. Trump started Monday playing down the virus, reminding Americans that tens of thousands of people die of the ordinary flu every year. “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,” he wrote on Twitter. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”He dismissed the effect of the outbreak in fueling Monday’s market meltdown. “Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,” he wrote. “That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!” Mr. Meadows was told over the weekend that he, too, might have come into contact with the infected attendee but tested negative, his congressional office said in a statement. “While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,” the statement said.Mr. Trump started Monday playing down the virus, reminding Americans that tens of thousands of people die of the ordinary flu every year. “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,” he wrote on Twitter. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths.

Senior officials engaged in spirited talks last week about whether to warn older Americans against traveling on cruise ships or to go even further than that.As those discussions intensified, at least eight members of the administration’s coronavirus task force, including those with medical backgrounds as well as cabinet officials like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, recommended sending the cruise notice.But two senior White House officials — Joe Grogan, the head of the Domestic Policy Council, and Larry Kudlow, the president’s national economic adviser — argued that they should consider the effects of such a move on 150,000 jobs in Florida, where the tourism industry could be particularly hard hit, according to two senior administration officials. Ultimately, the proponents of a notice won out and the State Department posted it on its website on Sunday.

"BAY CITY, Mich. — When the United Auto Workers went on strike against General Motors last fall, Robby Lamas and those left at the massive engine plant in this Michigan city walked the picket lines day and night. Mr. Lamas, who, at 30, was the youngest at the plant by a decade, was unsure how the public would react to the walkout, his first strike.After all, employment at the plant is now a fraction of what it once was. And not far from anyone’s mind was the fact that Bay County flipped to Republican in 2016, against the wishes of the U.A.W. The county was one of 12 former Democratic strongholds in Michigan that delivered parts of the once impregnable industrial Midwest to Donald J. Trump.Almost four years later, Bay City, the county seat, still has the feel of a traditional labor town. For the 40 days of the GM strike, nearly every car that passed the strikers honked. A steady stream of residents and businesses kept dropping off food, firewood, tents and other supplies. “People were donating stuff all the way to the end,” Mr. Lamas said.But fissures are never far from the surface. Mr. Lamas and some other workers were infuriated that President Trump did not offer support for the strikers. The union instructed them not to talk politics on the picket line, especially after a scuffle broke out between fellow strikers when one of them showed up carrying a Trump 2020 flag.

The union instructed them not to talk politics on the picket line, especially after a scuffle broke out between fellow strikers when one of them showed up carrying a Trump 2020 flag. The strike, the longest national walkout against GM since 1970, symbolized the contradictions and tensions in places like Bay City as Michigan prepares to vote on Tuesday, one of six states holding primaries or caucuses.Mr. Trump often touts a “blue-collar boom.” But there is a sense that residents in Bay County are barely hanging on. The poverty rate increased to almost 15 percent in 2017 from under 10 percent in 1999. Real median earnings for men working full-time and year-round fell about $7,000 in that time, as an ecosystem of factories that held up the Midwest was hollowed out, said Gabriel Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan’s Research Seminar in Qualitative Economics. The plant where Mr. Lamas works now employs fewer than 400 workers, down from nearly 5,000 at its peak.

Barreling down I-75, the north-south expressway that runs from the northern tip of Michigan to Florida, many drivers barely notice Bay City. Anchoring a flat landscape of factories and farms north of Detroit and Flint, this small, unassuming city is perhaps best known for being Madonna’s hometown.It happens to be my hometown as well.I graduated in 1984 from Garber High School, about three miles from the GM plant. Back then, mid-Michigan was just emerging from a recession so severe that some parents of my high school classmates lost their jobs.

Back then, mid-Michigan was just emerging from a recession so severe that some parents of my high school classmates lost their jobs.  Michigan came back then and, like the auto industry, has a history of booms and busts — and surprises. Political observers thought Michigan was a lock for the Democrats in 2016 because it had leaned that way in six previous presidential cycles and because President Barack Obama defied Republicans and bailed out GM and Chrysler during the financial crisis. Many still profess shock that the state went Republican instead. Even nearby Saginaw County, where more than 42 percent of residents are African-Americans, went for Mr. Trump.As the political stakes rise for Michigan, I found myself drawn to my hometown for signals about how 2020 will unfold.In a polarized nation, places like Bay City do not fall into a neat script. Democrats tend to favor gun rights and oppose abortion, which leaves them feeling out of step with the national party. Though young people like Mr. Lamas tend to be strong supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, others prefer former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., worried that a far-left candidate would not fare well in the general election.“This isn’t Ann Arbor or Lansing,” said Jim Barcia, referring to the state’s most liberal college towns. Mr. Barcia, a Democrat, was pressed back into service as Bay County’s county executive in 2016 after retiring after five terms in the House of Representatives.Not long ago, he watched as more than 100 angry residents crowded a meeting demanding that Bay County be declared a “Second Amendment sanctuary” amid talk of an assault weapons ban. “One 70-year-old lady had tears in her eyes,” recalled Mr. Barcia, an avid hunter who has two bucks mounted on his office wall.Asked how Bay City is doing these days, Mr. Barcia, a lifelong resident, points to the 1993 passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and a most favored nation trade pact with China. He estimates that Bay County has lost 7,500 jobs since 2000, almost a tenth of its population.“Much of what we feared ended up happening. I saw our manufacturers disappear,” said Mr. Barcia, who voted against both while in the House. “When Trump talked about trade, it really did resonate with working families.” Michigan came back then and, like the auto industry, has a history of booms and busts — and surprises.

Of the five most common occupations in Bay County, only one — a registered nurse — averages more than $25,000 a year. Manufacturing does not make the top five.“I don’t know anyone who isn’t working two or three jobs or has a side gig,” said Kim Coonan, the owner of Coonan’s Irish Hub, a neighborhood restaurant and bar down the street from the GM Powertrain plant, a backbone of the city since it began making parts for Chevrolet in 1916. “The middle class is gone.”Recently, there has been talk of more layoffs. Most of the stores in the Bay City mall have shuttered. Downtown is dotted with empty storefronts, between restaurants and condominiums that reflect budding efforts to remake the riverfront city into a destination.There are not a lot of Trump signs or MAGA hats visible here. Yet there is evidence of a quiet support for Mr. Trump for being willing to take on China, even if the results have been mixed. Support for labor runs so deep that what is expressed behind closed doors is often different than what is said in public, making political opinion hard to gauge. “People wear masks here,” said one business executive, who asked not to be identified by name.One exception to this rule: the area’s farmers, who are proudly supportive of the president. “In my group of friends, I don’t know anyone who won’t support Trump,” said Brian Johnson, who this year took over the family farm in Pinconning, north of Bay City. He received $80,000 in federal compensation from lost sales in soybeans to China last year, an amount he said prevented him from a financial disaster. For now, it seems that the people who are fortunate enough to have one job — and only one job — are thinking about politics more than others.Jeffrey Bulls works at Nexteer, a Chinese company that bought Saginaw Steering Gear, an auto supplier and a symbol of the shift toward a new global economic order. Purchased by the Chinese out of bankruptcy in 2009, it now employs about 12,000, down from 20,000 at its peak. Mr. Bulls started a podcast in his downtime, “Independent Jeff,” that focuses on issues of concern to African-American voters. “We get taken for granted too much,” Mr. Bulls said.

In this swing region of a swing state, Mr. Bulls senses that any outcome is possible in November, and that much may rest on the struggle so many people have to make ends meet. As I wandered through the region talking to people, it was those stories of getting by that emerged again and again. Uncertain still is which politician gets blamed for that and who benefits. “I don’t know what way it’s going to go this time,” Mr. Bulls said.

Perhaps the biggest one is college.“It’s flipped,” Mr. Harris said.“Until eight to 10 years ago, 60 percent went to a four-year college,” Mr. Harris said. “Now 60 percent go to community college instead.”The biggest reason, he says, is the cost. Michigan has a strong system of state universities. But with tuition and living expenses between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, attending a four-year college is simply not an option for many families.“I get out my phone and start showing them the figures. I tell them, ‘This is the amount of money you will owe,’” Mr. Harris said. “Somebody is going to go into debt. Some of them are shocked.”More than half of the 129 members of the class of 2019 are attending Delta College, a community college where many qualify for aid. Fewer than one-third are attending four-year colleges — and only a small handful are at the state’s top universities. On his bulletin board, Mr. Harris has a sticker touting the University of Michigan’s tuition guarantee for qualified students whose parents make under $60,000. Few students meet both the financial and academic requirements. ‘Somebody is going to go into debt’Bill Harris has seen a lot of changes in his 26 years as a guidance counselor at Garber High School in neighboring Essexville, where I graduated. Perhaps the biggest one is college.“It’s flipped,” Mr. Harris said.“Until eight to 10 years ago, 60 percent went to a four-year college,” Mr. Harris said. “Now 60 percent go to community college instead.”The biggest reason, he says, is the cost. Michigan has a strong system of state universities. But with tuition and living expenses between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, attending a four-year college is simply not an option for many families.“I get out my phone and start showing them the figures. I tell them, ‘This is the amount of money you will owe,’” Mr. Harris said. “Somebody is going to go into debt. Some of them are shocked.”More than half of the 129 members of the class of 2019 are attending Delta College, a community college where many qualify for aid. Fewer than one-third are attending four-year colleges — and only a small handful are at the state’s top universities. On his bulletin board, Mr. Harris has a sticker touting the University of Michigan’s tuition guarantee for qualified students whose parents make under $60,000. Few students meet both the financial and academic requirements. On a recent day, he called in one of the high school’s high-achieving juniors to talk about possibilities, including the University of Michigan scholarship. “Do you know how much your parents make?” Mr. Harris asked Jessica Albrecht, who is 17. She told him that her father is a truck driver, and her mother works in the school district.“I’m smart here, but I’m not sure I would be there,” Ms. Albrecht said of the possibility of the University of Michigan. Still, she seemed intrigued. If her parents’ combined income is under $60,000, Michigan could be a real option, Mr. Harris told her. If not, he said, pausing, as he tried to balance encouragement with reality, it is tougher.For years, young people in this area did not feel a lot of pressure to go to college. They could graduate and get a job at “the shop.” The U.A.W.-negotiated salary was a gateway to a middle-class life that supported places like Bay County, allowing people to marry, have a family, buy a house and, if they could eke out 20 years of service, even own a home or a boat “up north.”“You could have a very nice life,” Mr. Harris, who grew up in Bay City, recalled.Racing from one job to the nextThere is hardly a better place to watch today’s job shuffle than Coonan’s, where office workers, teachers, mechanics and others come to work extra hours as a second, third, even fourth job.The unemployment rate in Bay City is 4.7 percent, but that masks the fact that many jobs simply pay too little to make ends meet.Erin Sitkowski works as an account manager at the F.P. Horak Company, a prominent printing company in Bay City. But when she gets out of work at 5 p.m., she drives as fast as she can across town to reach Coonan’s within 15 minutes. “I knew it was time to get a second job when I was borrowing from my family to make ends meet,” said Ms. Sitkowski, who struggled financially after getting a divorce.

She remains nervous that there could be more reductions.Arianna Whisman is here at Coonan’s, too. This is but one of her four jobs, to pay for college at Saginaw Valley State University. And Kimberly Matula makes $15 an hour as a cook, but that does not go far as a single parent.“I worked two jobs for years, just to make ends meet,” Ms. Matula said. “Really, my kids raised themselves.”She recently took out a high-interest loan to buy a car, but said she was trying to hold things together for her 15-year-old daughter. “We are the blue-collar workers who make the country go around,” she said.‘We are one disaster away’Mr. Johnson’s father, Raymond, who is 65, owns more than 800 acres of farmland in nearby Pinconning. Asked on a recent blustery afternoon whether he was pleased that his son chose farming, too, he did not hesitate. “No, I wish he hadn’t farmed.” There were layoffs at the printing company the other day, and Ms. Sitkowski was upset to see 12 co-workers lose their jobs.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s campaign manager and a circle of allies have seized control of the Republican Party’s voter data and fund-raising apparatus, using a network of private businesses whose operations and ownership are cloaked in secrecy, largely exempt from federal disclosure.Working under the aegis of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, with the cooperation of Trump appointees at the Republican National Committee, the operatives have consolidated power — and made money — in a way not possible in an earlier, more transparent analog era. Since 2017, businesses associated with the group have billed roughly $75 million to the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and a range of other Republican clients.The takeover of the Republican Party’s under-the-hood political machinery parallels the president’s domination of a party that once shunned him, reflected in his speedy impeachment trial and summary acquittal. Elected Republicans have learned the political peril of insufficient fealty. Now, by commanding the party’s repository of voter data and creating a powerful pipeline for small donations, the Trump campaign and key party officials have made it increasingly difficult for Republicans to mount modern, digital campaigns without the president’s support.The process has not been exactly frictionless, shot through with accusations of empire-building and profiteering by the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and his allies. Mr. Parscale’s flagship firm, Parscale Strategy, has billed nearly $35 million to the Trump campaign, the R.N.C. and related entities since 2017 — the vast bulk of it, he says, passed along to advertising and digital firms.

What’s more, the move to consolidate voter data came at the expense of a competing data vehicle developed by the conservative activist Koch brothers, provoking resentment from Koch allies, especially in the Senate. And a fierce pressure campaign to centralize fund-raising on the new platform, a for-profit company that Mr. Trump branded WinRed, brought dissent from candidates initially reluctant to sign on, as well as competitors who believed they were being pushed aside without a fair hearing.For all that, WinRed, created last summer, has given the party an overdue counterweight to ActBlue, the Democrats’ small-donor fund-raising juggernaut. With WinRed, donors could contribute with a few clicks, and candidates could reap windfalls through joint appeals with the president. In its first six months, capitalizing on the Republican base’s outrage over impeachment, WinRed raised $100 million, a fast start, though still well behind the roughly $1 billion raised last year by ActBlue.

The Parscale-led group — including Katie Walsh Shields and her husband, Mike Shields, both former R.N.C. chiefs of staff; and the party’s former digital director, Gerrit Lansing — has also presided over the creation of a number of other political tools, from the president’s affiliated super PACs to a forthcoming party-controlled news app intended to produce cheerleading content.Mr. Parscale declined to comment in detail for this article.

Reince Priebus, then the R.N.C. chairman, offered this blunt assessment: “Our message was weak. Our ground game was insufficient. We weren’t inclusive. We were behind in both data and digital.” While Mr. Trump’s team shredded its core recommendation — a tolerant immigration policy and outreach to women and minorities — it embraced the call for technological change.Previously, parties had spent heavily on television advertising, but now the R.N.C. moved to rebuild around Data Trust, which it had recently helped establish. The idea was compelling: If state and national party committees and campaigns fed information into one place, it could create a deeper understanding of voters. If that place were outside the party, fund-raising limits would not apply. Contractors were fired, and much of the R.N.C.’s data staff was moved into Data Trust, which effectively became an off-campus arm of the party.“Naturally we faced opposition from a lot of the entrenched interests who had business models that benefited from the old way of doing things,” said Mr. Shields, the R.N.C. chief of staff in 2013 and 2014.That included the Koch brothers and their data vehicle, i360, which built personality profiles of millions of voters and was used by a number of campaigns. They weren’t the only skeptics who worried that the committee was steering business to its pet company. Aides to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, believed that Data Trust was inferior to its competitor, and Mr. McConnell gave senators the option of using either.The battle came to a head in mid-2016, when Mr. Priebus and Ms. Walsh-Shields, who had become R.N.C. chief of staff the previous year, visited the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She accused the committee of working against the interests of the party and its presumptive presidential nominee, Mr. Trump. From there, the meeting devolved into shouting, several Republicans with direct knowledge of the clash said.While Ms. Walsh-Shields said in a statement that she did not recall the specific meeting, she added: “I have found that quite often when a woman in a position of power disagrees with a man, it is later referred to as a bad meeting.” While Mr. Trump’s team shredded its core recommendation — a tolerant immigration policy and outreach to women and minorities — it embraced the call for technological change.Previously, parties had spent heavily on television advertising, but now the R.N.C. moved to rebuild around Data Trust, which it had recently helped establish.

But to Mr. Kushner and Mr. Parscale, who by then was the 2020 campaign manager, only one vendor was acceptable, according to several people with knowledge of the deliberations: a company called Revv which had already been processing payments for the campaign. Revv had been co-founded by Mr. Lansing, who was well regarded as a tech-savvy operator and for raising alarms about ActBlue for years. But in 2017, Politico reported that,  after taking over as the R.N.C.’s digital director the year before, he had encouraged Republican campaigns to use Revv, earning a $909,000 payout from the company. Some party veterans viewed this as self-dealing.By the summer of 2019, WinRed was created atop Revv’s platform, but only after negotiations that ended with the Senate campaign committee, and R.N.C. representatives, imposing restrictions that blocked Mr. Lansing from selling WinRed in the future and tightening control of firms he could hire.Mr. Lansing, in a statement, called WinRed “the work of seven months of lawyering to ensure every major stakeholder would be happy with all data, financial and ownership arrangements.”The new company was a joint venture between Revv and Data Trust, with 60 percent of profits going to Revv. (WinRed charges campaigns 3.8 percent, plus 30 cents per credit card transaction.) Officials involved would not detail Mr. Lansing’s remuneration. Mr. Parscale, Ms. Walsh-Shields and Mr. Shields do not own stakes, according to financial records reviewed by The New York Times.WinRed became ascendant, and this time the Trump team and Senate Republicans joined in a pressure campaign to convert holdouts. Mr. McConnell told colleagues at a lunch in mid-2019 that his personal goal was to “shut down all the competitors,” according to one senator who was surprised at the majority leader’s directness. The party even sent a cease-and-desist letter to one of the losing contenders, Anedot, instructing it to remove G.O.P. logos from solicitations. Revv had been co-founded by Mr. Lansing, who was well regarded as a tech-savvy operator and for raising alarms about ActBlue for years. But in 2017, Politico reported that,  after taking over as the R.N.C.’s digital director the year before, he had encouraged Republican campaigns to use Revv, earning a $909,000 payout from the company. Some party veterans viewed this as self-dealing.By the summer of 2019, WinRed was created atop Revv’s platform, but only after negotiations that ended with the Senate campaign committee, and R.N.C. representatives, imposing restrictions that blocked Mr. Lansing from selling WinRed in the future and tightening control of firms he could hire.Mr. Lansing, in a statement, called WinRed “the work of seven months of lawyering to ensure every major stakeholder would be happy with all data, financial and ownership arrangements.”The new company was a joint venture between Revv and Data Trust, with 60 percent of profits going to Revv. (WinRed charges campaigns 3.8 percent, plus 30 cents per credit card transaction.) Officials involved would not detail Mr. Lansing’s remuneration.

With or without a stake in WinRed, key aides have positioned themselves at the center of a formidable political machine. Ms. Walsh-Shields’s consulting firm receives a $25,000-a-month R.N.C. retainer and 1 to 5 percent of money it raises for the party’s 2020 convention. Mr. Shields’s firm, Convergence Media, represents clients ranging from the National Republican Congressional Committee to Representative Devin Nunes of California, one of the president’s staunchest defenders against impeachment.But it is Mr. Parscale who has most often been the focus of Mr. Trump’s complaints that those around him are making too much money from his name and brand. Mr. Parscale has not always discouraged suspicions. A few weeks before the 2016 election, the campaign staff gathered at the Whiskey Trader, a watering hole near Trump Tower, to play beer pong and brace for near-certain defeat. In walked Mr. Parscale, returning from dinner with a new campaign hire.“I’m making so much money!” Mr. Parscale declared, inserting an expletive, according to two people who were present.Mr. Parscale, in a statement, called their account “untrue and ridiculous,” but since his appointment as campaign manager, he has bought a $2.4 million canalside home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; two condos, owned with his family, together worth $2 million; and a Ferrari. A campaign official attributed the spending to Mr. Parscale’s relocation and divestment from businesses in Texas.But after a rival aide left an underlined copy of a Daily Mail story detailing his spending on the president’s desk, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Parscale for a pointed lecture, according to a senior White House official.Others in his circle have made purchases of their own. Mr. Lansing bought a $1.7 million home in Washington last year, while Ms. Walsh-Shields and Mr. Shields bought a $2 million beach house in the Florida panhandle. Asked about the house, Ms. Walsh-Shields referred a reporter to her mother, who said the down payment and mortgage payments had come mostly from her. Mr. Shields had also recently sold the house he owned before their marriage.That Ms. Walsh-Shields has endured is noteworthy. While Vice President Mike Pence said, in a statement, that “we are grateful for her hard work, loyalty and professionalism,” Mr. Trump has privately referred to her as a ‘leaker,’ blaming her for unflattering media coverage during her brief tenure as White House deputy chief of staff in 2017. He has pressed Ronna McDaniel, the party chairwoman, about Ms. Walsh-Shields’s role in recent days. And during a meeting last summer, after prodding by his longtime security consultant, Keith Schiller, the president asked if Ms. McDaniel trusted her, according to people with knowledge of the exchanges. “I do,” Ms. McDaniel replied. “She works for me.” With or without a stake in WinRed, key aides have positioned themselves at the center of a formidable political machine.

Opn Sesame’s specialty is texting voters, a burgeoning and lightly regulated field that is expected to be a factor in the 2020 campaign.To allay Mr. Trump’s concerns, tens of millions of dollars worth of campaign advertising that once ran through Parscale Strategy has been redirected to a new company, American Made Media, which is run by a Parscale lieutenant. There are no public records detailing the company’s financial structure; Mr. Parscale and other advisers said they did not profit from it. Mr. Parscale has declined to provide detailed accounting of his  network of interlocking businesses, and has told associates he follows Mr. Trump’s directive, relayed through Ms. McDaniel, that he make no more than $700,000 or $800,000 for his campaign work.Even to insiders, the campaign’s activities can seem opaque.Last fall, Mr. Pence’s office scheduled his first visit to the headquarters, to get a firsthand look. But when the day came, Mr. Parscale canceled, even though the visit was already on the vice president’s official schedule. Mr. Parscale, who spends much of his time working from his Florida home — though he recently said he would relocate to Washington — told Mr. Pence’s office that the campaign’s landlord had vetoed the idea, fearing a vice-presidential visit would disrupt other tenants. Mr. Pence was puzzled not to learn sooner, and the visit has not been rescheduled, two officials with knowledge of the episode said.For the moment, such concerns are muted as the Trump campaign, the R.N.C. and other affiliated committees raised $155 million in the final three months of 2019, a 23 percent increase over the previous quarter that was buoyed by the impeachment proceedings. The digital operation overseen by Mr. Coby and Mr. Parscale has been developing a series of new products, including a news app for volunteers to dole out Trump-friendly content, republish Trump-world tweets and raffle MAGA hats.

"DEARBORN, Mich. — The second highest, hardest glass ceiling is pretty good too, right?With the Democratic presidential nominee all but certain to be a man, party activists, elected officials and voters are setting their sights on the biggest consolation prize in American politics: the vice presidency.Within hours of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the race, a departure that left the party facing a primary battle between two septuagenarian white men, prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.At least one women’s organization, Supermajority, circulated a petition asking both Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to “affirm their commitment to gender equity” by choosing a woman as their running mate. On Sunday, as he endorsed Mr. Sanders before thousands at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., the Rev. Jesse Jackson called for the next president to pick a black woman as vice president.“There must be a woman on this ticket,” said Cecile Richards, a longtime abortion rights activist and a founder of Supermajority. “What is really important to see is representation, a commitment to the issues that women care about and a commitment to do something about it.” DEARBORN, Mich. — The second highest, hardest glass ceiling is pretty good too, right?With the Democratic presidential nominee all but certain to be a man, party activists, elected officials and voters are setting their sights on the biggest consolation prize in American politics: the vice presidency.Within hours of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the race, a departure that left the party facing a primary battle between two septuagenarian white men, prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.At least one women’s organization, Supermajority, circulated a petition asking both Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R.

They’re unlikely to face much opposition from the candidates: Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say they are considering multiple women for the position.The calls for a female vice president have intensified as the primary has essentially narrowed to a two-man race. Hillary Clinton said she would “love” to see a woman on the ticket but, in an interview with CNN, urged the future nominee to “take a really hard look at the Electoral College for what will help him.”On Sunday, Ms. Harris of California endorsed Mr. Biden, heightening speculation that she could be selected as his running mate. Despite a bitter competition, Mr. Biden remains fond of Ms. Harris, in part because she was friends with his late son Beau Biden when they both served as state attorneys general.“I believe in Joe,” she said in a video posted on Twitter. “I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time.” The selection of a female vice president, particularly one of color, would offer a fitting coda to a presidential primary where racial and gender representation has taken second place to concerns about defeating President Trump.Even when the female candidates were still in the race, people at town hall meetings and campaign rallies often suggested Ms. Warren or Senator Kamala Harris as possible No. 2s on a ticket, as a way of providing a dose of history-making enthusiasm without what many voters viewed as the risk of having a woman lead the ticket.

The former second lady described Ms. Harris’s debate-stage attacks on Mr. Biden’s record on race as a “punch to the gut.” She offered more praise for Senator Amy Klobuchar, who endorsed Mr. Biden last week, calling her “an incredible woman.” His wife expressed a slightly less glowing view of the California senator.At a Friday fund-raiser in the Chicago suburbs, a largely female audience shouted suggestions for vice-presidential nominees to Jill Biden, with many arguing the pick should be a woman.

While academics, activists and officials seeking to promote women in politics embrace the idea that a qualified woman could become vice president, some also cringe at being encouraged to settle for silver after spending a year competing hard for the gold.“In the current political environment, it looks tone deaf to have an all-white, all-male ticket,” said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on women in politics. “There’s no question that the notion of a female V.P. is used as a strategy and I think that’s a little bit sexist. It’s sort of like an ‘insert woman here’ kind of conversation.”People close to both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say their campaigns see strong political arguments for putting a woman on the ticket, believing such a choice could generate enthusiasm from female voters who make up the backbone of the party and sharpen their contrast with Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen women.Women remain Mr. Trump’s staunchest opponents, with large majorities consistently giving him some of the lowest marks in polling. His presidency has inspired the largest gender gap in history and supercharged turnout among female Democrats.

Only two have been nominated: Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska by the Republican Party in 2008 and Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro by Democrats in 1984.Putting a woman on the ticket could also move the country closer to electing a first female president. If elected, the female vice president could later find herself in a stronger position to win the presidency than any woman in American history.A vocal segment of the party argues that the vice-presidential slot must go not just to any woman but specifically to a black woman, given the crucial support African-American women have given to the Democrats in recent elections. Over the past three years, the overwhelming backing of black women helped the party recapture control of the House and flip Senate and governor’s seats in deep-red states like Louisiana and Alabama.“African-American women have been the most loyal supporters of Democratic candidates,” said Representative Barbara Lee of California, a former chairwoman of Ms. Harris’s campaign. “It’s time we have an African-American woman as vice president.”Nikema Williams, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Georgia, put it simply: “A black woman on the ticket is the margin of victory.”Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic Senate leader, is particularly focused on the idea, arguing that such a pick could help unite the party after a divisive primary, according to people who have spoken with Mr. Schumer.

Mr. Schumer isn’t the only party official intrigued by the idea of putting a black woman on the ticket. Some close to Mr. Biden are urging him to pick a nominee who could protect his support among black voters, whose strong support has helped him capture the lead in the primary race.Women of various backgrounds have been suggested as possible running mates for Mr. Biden.He recently named Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan as a national co-chair of his campaign. Other names that have been floated by Mr. Biden or those around him include Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader who narrowly lost a race for governor last year; Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general who became a Democratic icon after being fired by Mr. Trump early in his term; Ms. Klobuchar; and Senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, is seeking a woman who agrees with his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.” With many of his top female surrogates, including Representatives Ilhan Omar, Pramila Jayapal and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, disqualified from seeking the presidency because of their age or foreign birthplace, Ms. Warren is one of a few elected officials who fit the criteria, according to some close to the Sanders campaign.Following in the long tradition of possible vice-presidential picks, the women in the midst of all the chatter have largely declined to comment on whether they’ve been approached about the job. Ms. Whitmer said that she raised the issue of representation with Mr. Biden and planned to participate in all aspects of the campaign — including vetting possible running mates. Ms. Abrams recently said that she planned to be president by 2040 but would consider vice president in the meantime.

While little academic research has been done on female vice presidents, there’s plenty of data from business and economics that suggests women are more likely to be overlooked for chief executive positions and other top jobs. As in politics, it’s harder for assertive, ambitious women to be seen as likable, and easier to conclude they lack some intangible, ill-defined quality of leadership, the data shows.Yet there’s also little evidence that vice presidents — male or female — have a significant impact on converting undecided voters, despite all the thought campaigns put into selecting presidential running mates. Studies of the 2008 race found that while Ms. Palin shored up her party’s evangelical base, she did little to help John McCain, the Republican nominee, win over independent or Democratic-leaning women.“The research on the importance of the vice president is pretty compelling in that there’s a lot of strategy that goes into the pick and not a lot of evidence that it matters,” Dr. Lawless said.For months, both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have indicated that they are likely to select a female candidate. In February, Mr. Sanders said his campaign would select someone “maybe not of the same gender that I am.”During a town hall event in November, Mr. Biden floated four possible vice-presidential picks. All were women. He has also said both Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris would be on his list of potential picks.Last spring, weeks before Mr. Biden announced his bid, his advisers discussed naming either Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris to the ticket early, perhaps even before he captured the nomination. The unusual move was considered as a way to build enthusiasm and reassure voters about his age.A few weeks later, Ms. Harris pushed back, noting that Mr. Biden, in turn, would be an asset as the No. 2 on the ticket: “As vice president, he’s shown he can do the job.”Lisa Lerer reported from Dearborn, Mich., and Reid J.

In February, Mr. Sanders said his campaign would select someone “maybe not of the same gender that I am.”During a town hall event in November, Mr. Biden floated four possible vice-presidential picks. All were women. He has also said both Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris would be on his list of potential picks.Last spring, weeks before Mr. Biden announced his bid, his advisers discussed naming either Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris to the ticket early, perhaps even before he captured the nomination. The unusual move was considered as a way to build enthusiasm and reassure voters about his age.A few weeks later, Ms. Harris pushed back, noting that Mr. Biden, in turn, would be an asset as the No. 2 on the ticket: “As vice president, he’s shown he can do the job.”Lisa Lerer reported from Dearborn, Mich., and Reid J.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Monday night issued several pages of tips for navigating the coronavirus, organizing a set of recommendations for schools, businesses, homes and offices into a document that resembles easy-on-the-eye restaurant food-safety charts.The simple behaviors recommended in the guidelines — like washing hands, managing air flow, protecting food and carving out private space in a home — show how federal health officials believe the virus could influence everyday life.“These are really simple, low-tech things,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, said at a White House news briefing. “There’s nothing in there that’s complicated. But it’s just stated in a way that’s clear, that people can understand.”After the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence posted images of the guidelines on Twitter.

Here is what the guidelines recommend.How to navigate the officeStay home if you or family members who live with you are sick. Several top health officials have repeatedly urged Americans to not risk going to work if they come down with symptoms that might indicate an infection.Use the usual electronic means of work life, like email, to remind yourself to wash your hands. Devise ways to remember to not touch your face. And avoid shaking hands — “noncontact methods of greeting” are preferable.Instead of in-person meetings, the guidelines suggest teleconferencing. If meetings are held in person, they should be in open, well-ventilated rooms. Open windows will help.The World Health Organization warns that “poorly ventilated buildings affect air quality and can contribute to the spread of disease,” and that in health facilities with a high concentration of infectious patients, poor ventilation worsens the risk of transmission.How to divide a homeDivvy up your home to account for the elderly or those with underlying conditions that make them particularly susceptible to infection. Make a “protected space” for those at risk, and give the sick their own rooms, where the door should be kept closed. Only one person should care for the ill.

The next day he plunged Saudi Arabia into a price war with Russia that sent energy and stock markets around the world into free fall.For a while, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia had appeared to be living down his reputation for dangerous aggression.Perhaps chastened by the blowback over his connection with the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the 34-year-old crown prince had kept a low profile for more than a year.Now his new power plays are reviving debates in Western capitals about whether he is too rash to trust as a partner. His sudden, steep cut to the price of oil has rocked a global economy already at risk of falling into recession, threatened to burn through Saudi Arabia’s cash reserves and undermined his grandiose promises of new investments to lessen the kingdom’s dependence on oil.

Their arrests stirred anxious speculation among cowed members of the royal family that Crown Prince Mohammed might be sidelining opponents in preparation for taking the throne from his father, who is 84 and has sometimes appeared forgetful or disoriented. “It is mutually assured destruction for any oil exporting economy, certainly including Saudi Arabia and Russia and probably the United States as well,” said Greg Brew, a scholar of the region and a fellow at Southern Methodist University.“But this is typical MBS, right?” he added, referring to the crown prince by his initials. “He is a risk taker, and he is prone to impulsive decisions.”The detention of the senior royals, which began to leak out on Friday, has not been acknowledged or explained by the Saudi officials.Two of the detained princes — Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of the crown prince’s aging father, King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister — had once been seen as possible rivals for power.

He wanted to teach the rest of the family a lesson. People close to the royal court, though, insisted the crown prince had merely lashed out at his uncle and cousins for speaking critically about him. He wanted to teach the rest of the family a lesson. “It was quiet for a while and people were wondering if MBS had mellowed,” Steffen Hertog, a scholar at the London School of Economics, said. “But clearly his character is pretty persistent.”Prince Mohammed slashed the oil price to punish Russia, which he faulted for failing to cooperate in cutting production and propping up prices. The slowdown caused by the coronavirus was already reducing demand for oil.“The Russians called their bluff, and now the Saudis are trying to demonstrate to the Russians what the cost is of a lack of cooperation,” Professor Hertog said. But for Saudi Arabia, “it is a risky game of chicken.”Saudi Arabia has much more to lose than Russia. Russia has more diverse sources of revenue and it has built up its reserves since the last oil price downturn.Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, remains overwhelmingly dependent on oil. What’s more, its cash reserves have remained flat for about four years at around $500 billion, down from a peak of about $740 billion in the summer of 2014.Analysts say that the kingdom needs a so-called break-even price of about $80 a barrel to meet its budget without either further drawing down those reserves or adopting painful austerity measures. But the price on Monday fell to about $35 a barrel, less than half the break-even price. “It was quiet for a while and people were wondering if MBS had mellowed,” Steffen Hertog, a scholar at the London School of Economics, said. “But clearly his character is pretty persistent.”Prince Mohammed slashed the oil price to punish Russia, which he faulted for failing to cooperate in cutting production and propping up prices.

But the price on Monday fell to about $35 a barrel, less than half the break-even price. A downturn of as much as two years could cut into those reserves severely enough to put pressure on the Saudi exchange rate as well as the plans to diversify the economy, Professor Hertog said.The crown prince’s economic plan for the country centered on a public offering of shares in the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, to raise money to invest in other sectors. But plans for a debut on a major international market were pulled in favor of the more lax Saudi domestic exchange, and over the last two days the oil price cut has sent shares tumbling by 20 percent, shaving $320 billion off the value of the company.The timing of the price war so soon after the roundup of his royal relatives on Friday has aroused speculation that the crown prince sought to contain potential opponents in anticipation of trouble. Perhaps he wanted to pre-empt any foes before economic pain from the downturn made him politically vulnerable, some suggested.“The threat to MBS is not coming from his royal rivals,” argued Kristin Smith Diwan, a scholar at the Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It is coming from the collapse in oil revenues and what that does to his ambitious economic plans.”But other analysts, former diplomats and officials with experience in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis close to the royal court said that Prince Mohammed had consolidated power so thoroughly that he had little left to fear.With a level of ruthlessness unprecedented in modern Saudi history, the crown prince has seized more direct power over the kingdom than any monarch in decades, largely by intimidating into submission his own sprawling ruling family. Even in a severe downturn, the members of the royal family he detained had little hope of challenging him.

He had already put the same royals under tight surveillance, limiting their ability to plot against him, according to people close to the royal court.A spokesman for the Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.The most senior figure detained, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, more than 70 years old, had once been recorded in London making comments distancing himself from the crown prince’s policies but had since appeared submissive, at least in public.The other prominent royal detained, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, had already been under house arrest since 2017, when he was removed from his posts as crown prince and interior minister by the current crown prince.Previous Saudi rulers might have provided some advance warning to Washington and London before such high profile detentions, former diplomats said. Crown Prince Mohammed had met in Riyadh last week with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab of Britain and last month with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Yet the crown prince gave no indication that the arrests were imminent, according to diplomats and other officials with knowledge of the matter.

Western officials worry about the “reputational risk” of associating with such an unpredictable leader, said Emile Hokayem, a scholar at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. But so far Prince Mohammed has faced few adverse consequences. He has led a five-year military intervention in Yemen that has produced a humanitarian catastrophe. He rounded up hundreds of his royal relatives and other wealthy Saudis in a Ritz Carlton hotel in 2017 to squeeze them for repayment of what he claimed was self enrichment. He even temporarily kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and forced him to announce a resignation (which the prime minister later retracted).American intelligence agencies concluded that in 2018 Prince Mohammed ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist who lived in Virginia.Since then, some analysts have seen signs of maturation, in particular his pulling back from a potential armed clash with his nemesis, Iran, last year.

Even as Mr. Biden is heading a bandwagon with former 2020 rivals and moderate Democratic voters clambering aboard, Mr. Sanders has a loyal base that is emotionally bound to him, an attachment rooted in their own economic struggles and lived experiences, rather than triangulating the most electable candidate.Tuesday’s primary contests, in six states including Missouri and Washington, are unfolding against a backdrop of high anxiety over the economic and health consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. For most Sanders voters, plummeting stock prices matter less than the broader injustices he champions around wage inequality, health care and student loan debt.If Mr. Sanders defies expectations in Michigan, a state he won in the 2016 primary, it will be because his all-out efforts here over the last four days succeeded in broadening his support, reversing the demographic trends that broke against him on Super Tuesday.

Mr. Booker endorsed the former vice president on Monday. Earlier he sent Senator Amy Klobuchar for a couple of low-key events.“If you look at what Joe’s running here versus what we’re running here,” Bill Neidhardt, a Sanders spokesman, said over the weekend, “they’ll send a surrogate or two out here, but we’re going to have Bernie talk to as many people as possible, and then we’re going to have door knockers talk to as many people as possible.”On Sunday, according to campaign counts, Mr. Sanders drew crowds of more than 7,000 in Grand Rapids, where the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the two-time presidential candidate, endorsed him, and over 10,000 in Ann Arbor, where he was introduced by America’s second most popular democratic socialist, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.“In order for us to win we have to grow, we must be inclusive, we must bring more people into this movement,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.One possible sign of progress in widening his coalition is that former supporters of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week but has yet to make an endorsement, were not hard to find in the Sanders multitudes.

He remembered “during the Clinton administration where I made like 80, 90 grand, but apparently that was too much.”His wife, Kim, who lost her job as an education administrator in January, said: “I was just thinking this morning, my dad, he was 58 when he retired from the telephone company. He had a very nice retirement. Belonged to the union. And here I am 55 and nowhere near to retiring.”Younger voters often brought up the huge burden of college debt for their generation, which Mr. Sanders proposes to cancel.

They revealed that Mr. Sanders has not overcome his weakness with black voters. Despite years of outreach to African-Americans since his loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic race, Mr. Sanders saw black voters choosing his rival in Southern states on Super Tuesday.He won Michigan that year — the high-water mark of his campaign — by carrying white voters, especially whites without a college degree, who represented more than one in three voters. Winning those voters again not just in Michigan but in Ohio and Illinois, which vote on March 17, undergirds Mr. Sanders’s hope for a comeback.His TV ads and his speeches hammer Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement, reviled by many factory workers, and for past statements suggesting an openness to cutting Social Security.

He is hopeful, if not entirely optimistic, that Mr. Sanders can again win working-class white voters in Michigan, many of whom in 2016 may have been voting against Mrs. Clinton and have since been lost to President Trump.“I hope that people actually stop and listen to what he actually has to say, instead of the party lines,” Mr. Chatters said. “Sometimes people are so swayed by the term ‘socialism’ when they’re driving on their free roads, they’re taking their kids to the free school.”In the Super Tuesday primaries, it was Mr. Biden who won working-class white voters, helping him to carry Northern states including Maine and Minnesota, an ominous sign for Mr. Sanders. Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said he was skeptical of Mr. Sanders’s ability to repeat his 2016 Michigan win, or his chances elsewhere in the Midwest, because Democrats this year, who singularly want to beat Mr. Trump, are less open to revisiting arguments over trade or Social Security.“Voters, astonishingly, have taken over the nominating process,” he said. “Biden did well among blacks, suburban whites and white working-class voters because they want him to take on Trump.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Senator Bernie Sanders has a problem winning over black voters.It was clear in 2016, when he stumbled on issues of race and faced protests from Black Lives Matter activists.It was clear after the Super Tuesday contests last week, when Joe Biden cruised to victory on the strength of his decisive margins among black voters in Virginia, North Carolina and other states. And as the race moves to Michigan, Florida, Illinois and other delegate-rich, diverse states, it’s becoming even clearer that Mr. Sanders’s failure to win significant support with black voters could end up dooming his second primary bid.As I traveled with the Sanders campaign across Michigan this past weekend, he drew huge crowds, as he often does. But they were overwhelmingly white.Those demographics were stark in a state where black voters are expected to make up nearly a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate on Tuesday.Clearly, the Sanders campaign wants to expand beyond its base. At seven rallies over three days, it showcased a diverse array of supporters, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the celebrity academic Cornel West.In Grand Rapids, Mr. Sanders accepted the endorsement of a man he called “one of the true heroes of modern America,” the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Like Mr. Sanders hopes to do, Mr. Jackson used a surprise victory in Michigan to buoy his 1988 presidential bid.

Jesse Jackson. Like Mr. Sanders hopes to do, Mr. Jackson used a surprise victory in Michigan to buoy his 1988 presidential bid. (Fun deep cut: In the Vermont caucuses that year, Mr. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was “slapped by an irate citizen after casting his vote” for Mr. Jackson.)Yet, at a town-hall meeting in Flint, billed as an opportunity for Mr. Sanders to make a case directly to black voters, the Vermont senator refused to discuss issues of particular concern to black Americans. Instead, before yet another overwhelmingly white audience, he ceded the stage to African-American surrogates who delivered a series of searing attacks on Mr. Biden’s record.His campaign said Mr. Sanders had scrapped his speech in order to “lift up” the voices of the black panelists.“Bernie does not have those experiences,” a campaign spokesman said. “He’s a white Jewish man.”Presidents, of course, have to talk about all kinds of issues affecting all kinds of people — whether they have direct experience with them or not. No president, for example, has ever given birth.Mr. Sanders has shown little hesitation in expressing his opinions on issues impacting Latinos, women or L.G.B.T.Q. Americans. (And he has found success with Latino voters, who make up just a sliver of the Michigan electorate.) Yet, while Mr. Sanders rattles off policy positions on issues like criminal justice, housing and education, he seems less comfortable driving a message around racial justice and the lived experiences of African-Americans.Part of the problem Mr. Sanders may face is fundamental: His campaign is deeply rooted in his democratic socialism, focused heavily on class as the root of all the country’s ills. Racial discrimination is a byproduct of economic inequality, rather than the cause, in Mr. Sanders’s telling.From Flint to Ann Arbor, Mr. Sanders cast his campaign as a unifying cause for working-class Americans, focused heavily on economic issues like the cost of college, unions, health care and low wages. He talks far less and in far less explicit terms about racial injustice.

The next morning, Mr. Jackson delivered a message focused on racial injustice, even calling for Mr. Sanders to put a black woman on the ticket.As I watched Mr. Jackson address thousands gathered in downtown Grand Rapids, I couldn’t help but think about what a fascinating political moment this must be for him. His dream of a “rainbow coalition” has been realized in today’s Democratic Party.

In the majority of states, those people have not yet been elected by the party. That’s a process that typically happens at state party conventions well after the initial primaries or caucuses. When that happens, the delegates that are allocated based on statewide results — about 25 percent of the total — will just be reallocated to candidates still remaining in the race.The remaining 75 percent, which are allocated based on congressional district results, are technically still the property of the candidate who won them. But the actual delegates — meaning the humans — are not legally bound, so they’re likely to just vote for someone still in the race, probably the person whom their original candidate endorsed. That process typically happens with some behind-the-scenes coordination between the two campaigns (the one still operating and the one that ended).This reshuffling is a standard process in Democratic presidential politics and is part of the reason Democrats haven’t had a contested convention in decades. In 2016, some states unanimously announced that they backed Hillary Clinton at the party convention, even though she didn’t win all the delegates from those states.

"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preparing to unveil a sweeping plan to lower the cost of health care, moving to address the top concern of voters while giving moderate Democrats who face tough re-election races a way to distance themselves from the Medicare for All plan embraced by the progressive left and derided by Republicans as socialism.The legislation, timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, is part of a major push by Democrats to position themselves as the party of health care before the 2020 elections. Former President Barack Obama will support the effort, appearing with Ms. Pelosi at American University in Washington on March 23, 10 years to the day he signed the Affordable Care Act into law.While the measure has little chance of survival in the Republican-controlled Senate, it is the latest evidence that Democratic leaders, determined to protect their House majority and the moderate lawmakers who helped them to power, are looking for ways to distinguish their rank and file from the party’s presidential nominees.The plan bears no resemblance to Medicare for All, the national health insurance system championed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the self-described democratic socialist. And it omits a “public option” to create a government-run health insurer, an idea embraced by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner.

And it omits a “public option” to create a government-run health insurer, an idea embraced by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner. In steering clear of the ideas promoted by both leading presidential candidates, Ms. Pelosi is hoping to protect the so-called front-liners who flipped Republican seats in 2018 and delivered Democrats the majority.The speaker’s new proposal is aimed at reducing costs under the current health bill, according to people familiar with it, who insisted on anonymity to describe a plan that was not yet public. Details are still being finalized, and Ms. Pelosi — who was to meet Monday evening with Democratic committee chairs to discuss a response to the coronavirus epidemic — has not yet shared them with her rank and file. The speaker’s office declined to comment.The plan could be unveiled as early as this week, though coronavirus could upend that timeline. In eschewing Medicare for All, Ms. Pelosi is turning away from a proposal that does not have the votes to pass the House and has divided Democrats on Capitol Hill.Instead, the speaker is expected to propose a series of steps to make health care more cost-effective under the Affordable Care Act, including expanding tax credits and subsidies to help people buy insurance and creating a national program to help cover expenses for those with medical conditions. The plan is expected to spotlight ideas put forth by vulnerable freshmen like Representatives Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Angie Craig of Minnesota.But Ms. Pelosi’s reluctance to embrace Mr. Sanders’s bold vision may draw the ire of her caucus’ left wing, which is pushing for a vote on Medicare for All. Her decision to shy away from the public option is especially notable, given that the House included such a system when it passed its version of the Affordable Care Act in 2019. The provision was later stripped out by the Senate.

That unifies the country and unifies the party,” Mr. Dach said. “What we have had is a debate with tremendous missed opportunities. Democrats should have been up there reminding people what Donald Trump has been doing to their health care, not arguing as much about where they want to go.”Polls show the public is deeply concerned about the high cost of health care but divided over what to do about it. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a slight majority of respondents — 53 percent — favored a Medicare for All approach that would cover everyone on a single government plan. A much larger majority, 65 percent, favored a public option.Republicans have latched onto Mr. Sanders and Medicare for All as a way to paint Democrats as socialists, a strategy that is unlikely to change no matter what proposal Ms. Pelosi puts forth or who becomes the Democratic nominee. “No one is opposed to a pragmatic step that’s feasible,” he said. “What we’re opposed to is a lack of imagination and boldness in not giving a vote on policies that economics and health experts are saying is what the country needs.”But Leslie Dach, a Democratic strategist and the chairman of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group, said it was important for Democrats to spotlight what they could agree on, especially after a string of presidential primary debates where Democrats beat up one another over their health care plans instead of going after President Trump.“If you do the polling, 80 percent of the people want to lower costs, and they want to protect critical things like pre-existing conditions.

Such positions, he said, “make the argument that Democrats have become socialists a particularly effective one, no matter how much they now try to run away from it.”The Affordable Care Act anniversary comes as the law itself is in fresh peril. It has survived numerous Republican attempts and a vow by Mr. Trump to repeal it, as well as a string of court challenges.But the Supreme Court, which has twice ruled to leave most of the provisions intact, recently agreed to hear a third case, which could wipe out the Affordable Care Act entirely. When Democrats took over the House in January 2019, they voted to intervene in the case, Texas v. U.S., which was brought by conservative state attorneys general seeking to overturn the law.Democrats campaigned aggressively in 2018 on lowering costs and protecting health coverage, and they have already taken some steps to make good on those promises.In May, they passed legislation to reverse Trump administration rules that allowed the expansion of health care plans that did not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act’s mandated coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. And in December, the House voted to lower the rising cost of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers.But like most legislation passed by House Democrats, the two health bills are languishing in the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, refuses to take them up. “Voters have watched as the Democratic Party has moved further and further left, to the point where now a majority of their members support canceling private health care entirely for BernieCare,” said Dan Conston, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee affiliated with House Republicans.

It would create a so-called reinsurance program, which would provide government funds to help insurers offset the cost of patients with expensive medical conditions. And it would make subsidies more generous for people with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty line.Other Democrats, including Ms. Underwood and Ms. Craig, have put forth similar ideas.

"PHOENIX — “This is a campaign of the working class, by the working class and for the working class!”Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont nearly shouted those words to a raucously supportive crowd here last week. The line received thunderous applause, as it always does.At campaign events over the past year, Mr. Sanders has spoken to tens of thousands of people who come to hear his message of political revolution — who come to imagine a country with universal health care, no student debt and a $15 minimum wage. Almost every line he says onstage rises to a crescendo, inviting cheers of appreciation. With every promise and policy proposal, the crowd becomes a sea of waving blue and white signs with the “Bernie” logo.The Sanders campaign has exposed a class divide within the Democratic Party: His promises of a leg up are most alluring to those who need it, and most confounding to those who do not.

Six more states go to the polls on Tuesday in what is now a head-to-head matchup in the Democratic presidential race between Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The path for Mr. Sanders to retake a delegate lead is much narrower than it was a week ago, but no matter how the primaries turn out for Mr. Sanders, he has built a fierce following of voters who want and expect more from their party, from their government, from their country.

That’s how Audrey Yanos views Mr. Sanders and this political moment. Ms. Yanos, a 39-year-old medical administrator, has voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election in her adult life. But Ms. Yanos has misgivings: Those Democrats, she believes, have never done all that much to deliver the promise of the American dream. She has begun to feel that the country has betrayed people like her.Mr. Sanders, she says, is different. Ms. Yanos voted for him in 2016, and did so again last Tuesday in the Colorado primary, which he won easily over Mr. Biden.“We are struggling all the time, and what we have is not working,” she said one evening last week during a brief break between dinner and her son’s basketball practice. “We’re all scraping by, one disaster away from real catastrophe, and we need someone who understands that.” That’s how Audrey Yanos views Mr. Sanders and this political moment.

If the Democratic Party wants to keep such voters engaged and committed to showing up in the fall, leaders will have to speak more directly to them and better address their needs.Many of his supporters know what it’s like to struggle in one way or another. They need prescription drugs but can’t afford them. They are buried under relentless student debt. They juggle jobs with caring for ailing parents or young children, or both. They want better lives, more stable lives, and need some help.When Mr. Sanders has asked people at his town halls to tell their stories — often by prodding them to share their insurance premiums or deductibles — their voices have sometimes shaken. Sometimes there are tears.

Sometimes there are tears. Ms. Yanos was the first person in her family to attend college. She considers herself lucky because a scholarship paid for tuition and books, so she graduated with about $25,000 in debt, which she paid off last year. Financially, she is far better off than her parents were when she was a child. And yet she sees no evidence of a booming economy in her own life.“I look around and see so many other people barely holding on,” Ms. Yanos said, choking back tears as her kids did their homework at the kitchen table. “It’s not that I think it will be all rainbows and sunshine if he’s elected, things won’t change overnight. But people younger than me, they are going to demand change in their lifetime.”Everything seemed to be clicking for Mr. Sanders before last week. He had finished at the top of the nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, then dominated in Nevada. But on Super Tuesday, a surging Mr. Biden all but extinguished that momentum, winning 10 of 14 states with the support of many black working-class voters. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are now heading into primaries in Michigan and other major Midwestern states that are favorable in many ways to the former vice president. But Mr. Sanders also enjoys plenty of support in these states, particularly from white working-class voters. Ms. Yanos was the first person in her family to attend college.

In both of his bids for the White House, Mr. Sanders has shown that his populist message resonates in some corners, even as it repels much of the Democratic establishment, which has steadily lined up behind Mr. Biden. Rallies for Mr. Sanders often resemble rock concerts, drawing tens of thousands of people who come decked out in campaign gear, with T-shirts that proclaim “Unidos con Bernie” and signs that say “Not me, Us.”Polling throughout the campaign has shown Mr. Sanders drawing some of his strongest support from voters with household incomes under $50,000; his numbers taper off as incomes rise. A month ago, when he was leading in the polls, people with household incomes of $50,000 and under supported Mr. Sanders twice as much as any other candidate. At that time, he commanded the support of most Democratic voters making $100,000 and under.Exit polls on Super Tuesday did not ask respondents directly about their income. But in the three states where he won and exit polls were conducted — Colorado, Vermont and California — Mr. Sanders performed five to eight percentage points better among those without a college degree than those with one. In Massachusetts and Minnesota, both states he had hoped to win but ended up losing decisively to Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders’s numbers among college graduates lagged his showing among those without degrees by double digits.“Bernie is the only candidate I’ve ever felt a connection to, in a sense that he genuinely cares about the working class in a way that no other candidate has ever shown support to us,” said Andrew Hilbert, 26, who came to see Mr. Sanders in Phoenix.Mr. Sanders’s support this year has proved particularly enduring in the West, where many communities remain visibly scarred by the Great Recession. And his focus on the working class helps explain part of his appeal to Latino voters, who are disproportionately young and are more likely to come from a working-class background. Many such voters point to the illusion of an “up by your bootstraps” mentality and strongly believe that the only way to create a fair economy is to drastically change the way the current one works.“We’ve had decades of policies fail to meet our needs, and we’ve got to break that cycle,” said Antonio Arellano, the executive director of Jolt, a group in Texas that focuses on turning out young Latino voters and that endorsed Mr. Sanders. “What we’re seeing for the first time ever is the courage to break from the past and radically build the future.

Ms. Estrada calls herself a “romantic but pragmatic” socialist, and said she was not all that optimistic that Mr. Sanders would win the primary, let alone the presidency. Her biggest hope, she said, is that he is ushering in a new era of politics with more of a focus on the poor.

Like other Latino supporters of the Vermont senator, Ms. Estrada views herself as part of a movement that will live on regardless of his political fate, and that harks back to the Chicano movement of the 1960s and ’70s. “This is a country that wants the current class structure to stay in place, and it’s really hard to fight against that.”Many working-class supporters point to Mr. Sanders’s opposition to the Iraq war as the initial issue that drew them into his orbit.

"WASHINGTON — North Korea has evaded United Nations sanctions for many months by exporting coal, sand and petroleum, and importing luxury goods including armored sedans, alcohol and robotic machinery. The findings are based on an upcoming U.N. report, other assessments using satellite images and shipping data, and interviews with analysts.The exports provide North Korea with money to continue developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, analysts say. And the imports of luxury goods show techniques that North Korea might also be using to procure dual-use technology for those programs, they say. The efforts to raise money are aided by the country’s sophisticated cybercrime operations that target financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges.The upcoming annual report from the United Nations Panel of Experts gives more detail on the smuggling of two armored Mercedes sedans that were shipped from the Netherlands to East Asia in 2018 and that were the subject of an investigation by The New York Times and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in July.The U.N. panel did its own investigation after the article and video appeared, and concluded that the cars were shipped from Europe after they were in the possession of two Italian companies — apparently the start of the supply chain, according to a draft of the report seen by The Times. The United Nations is expected to release the report this month.

In December, the two nations proposed to the United Nations an easing of sanctions.American officials and analysts cite satellite images that show transfers involving North Korean ships in Chinese territorial waters as evidence of efforts to evade the sanctions.“The Chinese have to enforce the sanctions against North Korea. They’ve got to stop the ship-to-ship transfers,” Robert C. O’Brien, President Trump’s national security adviser, said last month. “We need the Chinese to assist us as we pressure the North Koreans to come to the table,” he added.

The United States has pushed the United Nations to pass five rounds of sanctions resolutions since 2016.Mr. Trump has made diplomacy with North Korea a signature foreign policy initiative. But American officials are frustrated that the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has rejected outreach from Washington since a round of talks between negotiators ended abruptly in Stockholm last October. That came after the failure of the second summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February 2019.The porous sanctions mean the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against North Korea is far from effective, and American officials are losing what they say is their only real leverage. That could help explain Pyongyang’s recent cold shoulder toward Washington, experts say.

Mr. Kim surprised American officials this winter by not sending what North Korean officials had called a potential “Christmas gift” to Mr. Trump — possibly a test of a nuclear weapon or an intercontinental ballistic missile. In early 2019, Mr. Kim had given Mr. Trump a year-end deadline to lift sanctions.The successful evasion of sanctions might mean less urgency on Mr. Kim’s part in getting the penalties lifted. He continues to get revenue while building up his stockpile of fissile material, adding to the amount he already has for about 38 nuclear warheads, according to a recent estimate by Siegfried S. Hecker, the former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.North Korea has continued to carry out tests of short-range ballistic missiles and rocket systems, with no admonishment from Mr. Trump. On Monday, North Korea launched multiple projectiles off its east coast in the country’s second weapons test in a week. Before Monday’s tests, it fired two short-range projectiles off its east coast on March 2, its first weapons test in three months.

The draft of the U.N. report says North Korea conducted 13 missile tests and launched 25 missiles in 2019. (Reuters first reported on parts of the U.N. study last month.)It is unclear how the global crisis over the new coronavirus, which began in China, will affect North Korea. The country has not reported any cases, but experts say there most likely are some. North Korea has closed almost all border entry points and put foreigners in the country under quarantine, but is now asking them to leave. Last month, the United States approved the transfer of humanitarian aid, and the United Nations has allowed some exemptions to sanctions for aid.“On the North Korean side, they have asked for assistance and will need to coordinate points of entry for the urgent supplies with the aid organizations,” said Kee Park, a Korean-American doctor who regularly leads medical delegations to North Korea.North Korean leaders might have to use some of the revenue accrued from smuggling for social welfare needs, if they are not doing so already.Some analysts say the visit to North Korea in June by President Xi Jinping of China might have marked a turning point in sanctions enforcement.“Given the deterioration of U.S.-China ties, Beijing’s leaders are in no mood to cooperate with Washington on North Korea issues,” said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst on North Korea who is now at the Brookings Institution. “And judging from the opening of new resort and tourism areas and robust department store offerings, the regime and the elite are successfully finding loopholes.” The draft of the U.N. report says North Korea conducted 13 missile tests and launched 25 missiles in 2019.

In the draft of its new report, the U.N. panel lists the vehicle identification numbers of the two armored Mercedes sedans shipped to North Korea in the summer of 2018. The numbers allowed investigators to ferret out additional details on the shipment and the companies involved.The report names two Italian companies as procurers, but did not accuse them of illegal activity.Mr. Cianci, a sales manager for European Cars and More SRL, the Italian company that bought the cars from Mercedes-Benz in early 2018, said in lengthy interviews that he had not violated any export regulations and expressed frustration that Mercedes-Benz had cut business ties with him in December 2019.He did not provide the name of the client for whom he bought the cars. “My client is Italian. He has an import-export business in Rome,” Mr. Cianci said. “The client is someone with not only diplomatic connections to China, but also other countries.”The second Italian company named in the report is LS Logistica e Spedizioni SRL, based in Rome. It was responsible for shipping the cars to Dalian, China, and then onward to Japan. The company did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, was not able to provide additional details on the specific cars, but released a statement that said the “sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility.”“For many years, we have only received photos of cars, which gave us no possibility to identify any of the vehicles. Only in 2019, we received VIN numbers of vehicles mentioned in the C4ADS report from a journalist of an Asian television network,” the statement continued, using the abbreviation for the Center for Advanced Defense Studies. “We then proactively approached the U.N. and connected the journalists directly with the authority to make sure that the information could be subject matter of investigations.” In the draft of its new report, the U.N. panel lists the vehicle identification numbers of the two armored Mercedes sedans shipped to North Korea in the summer of 2018. The numbers allowed investigators to ferret out additional details on the shipment and the companies involved.The report names two Italian companies as procurers, but did not accuse them of illegal activity.Mr. Cianci, a sales manager for European Cars and More SRL, the Italian company that bought the cars from Mercedes-Benz in early 2018, said in lengthy interviews that he had not violated any export regulations and expressed frustration that Mercedes-Benz had cut business ties with him in December 2019.He did not provide the name of the client for whom he bought the cars. “My client is Italian. He has an import-export business in Rome,” Mr. Cianci said. “The client is someone with not only diplomatic connections to China, but also other countries.”The second Italian company named in the report is LS Logistica e Spedizioni SRL, based in Rome. It was responsible for shipping the cars to Dalian, China, and then onward to Japan.

North Korea is raising millions of dollars through the smuggling of commodities, the U.N. report says.Last October, Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, a member of the United Nations Panel of Experts from 2014 to 2019, wrote on the 38 North website that the “maximum pressure” campaign on North Korea was “on its last legs.”“The Trump administration bears special responsibility for this situation,” she wrote. “It has been its own worst enemy in the maximum-pressure campaign.”She asserted that Mr. Trump “remains unwilling to admit fault or failure for the lack of progress on denuclearization or to change the U.S. approach to negotiations with the North.”North Korea has been creative in its sources of revenue. Both the upcoming U.N. report and a separate post this month by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies noted an increase in sand-dredging activity by North Korean ships in 2019. A center of the operation was in Haeju Bay, North Korea, from March to August. Chinese companies are the main buyer of the sand, an important material in construction projects and in making silicon chips. The holes in sanctions go well beyond the importing of luxury goods.

"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether judges must determine that juvenile offenders are incorrigible before sentencing them to die in prison.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump has spent the past several weeks dismissing concerns about any economic effects from the coronavirus and insisting that American companies and consumers are in no danger.On Monday, after stock markets suffered their worst single-day decline in more than a decade, Treasury yields reached new lows and oil prices plummeted, Mr. Trump said he was ready to act.The president said the White House would unveil “very dramatic” proposals to help protect the American economy from the coronavirus, including financial help for workers who don’t get paid sick leave, tax cuts and targeted relief for industries battered by the virus, including cruise lines, airlines and hotels.The overture sets up tense negotiations with Congress, just weeks after the president was impeached by House Democrats and less than a year from Election Day. Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump’s efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president’s handling of the crisis.

Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump’s efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president’s handling of the crisis. Democrats have expressed openness to certain measures of stimulus — like paid sick leave and increased spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps — that could provide the building blocks for a deal with the president. And Mr. Trump’s efforts could be aided by the fact that federal borrowing costs have fallen to rock-bottom rates as skittish investors in recent days have piled into safe U.S. government debt.Mr. Trump’s decision to seek fiscal help amounts to concession by a White House that has ignored increasingly ominous predictions of the virus’s economic effects, which have ranged from dramatically slowing growth in the United States to plunging the economy into recession.That threat was compounded over the weekend by Saudi Arabia’s announcement that it would ramp up oil production, sending prices into a downward spiral and raising the threat of layoffs and shelved investments in the American oil industry.Mr. Trump and his aides had played down the economic threats as recently as Monday morning, when the president celebrated falling gas prices as “good for the consumer” while blaming the stock plunge on a combination of Saudi Arabia, Russia and “fake news.” He also suggested fears about the virus were overblown, saying more people have died from the flu than the new coronavirus. “Life & the economy go on,” he tweeted.

Investors are worried about economic fallout from an epidemic that is threatening to slow growth and eat into corporate profits by shuttering factories, forcing quarantines, curtailing travel and scrapping big events.Stocks are plummeting, along with Treasury yields, and many economists and investors are beginning to express concern that financial vulnerabilities could exacerbate what is already poised to become an economic mess.Banks are on more solid footing than they were ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, with higher capital and less ability to make risky bets with their own balance sheets than in the heady days of the mid-2000s housing bubble.

But warning signs abound. Credit markets are beginning to show signs of strain, investors are fleeing indexes that track risky bonds, and some economists are questioning whether the coronavirus could spark a corporate debt crisis. “If the virus triggers a sharper drop in profits or a bigger rise in borrowing costs than we envisage, then these pockets of vulnerability could blow up,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note last week. “Although the global banking system appears to be better placed to deal with such turbulence now than at the time of the global financial crisis, at the very least this could exacerbate any virus-related global downturn.”The White House has invited top Wall Street executives to a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout, according to an official.As recently as January, Federal Reserve officials expressed worry that “financial imbalances — including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness — could amplify an adverse shock to the economy.”Corporate debt has skyrocketed over the past decade, and more than half of investment-grade company debt is just one notch above a “junk” rating, with BBB debt in the United States now totaling more than $3 trillion. Such bonds are vulnerable to status downgrades in tough times — Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners estimates that as much as $1 trillion of investment-grade debt could soon head to junk.That is of particular concern because mutual funds are holding big chunks of BBB debt. Funds could be forced to dump those holdings quickly in the face of downgrades because many are not allowed to invest in junk bonds. “If the virus triggers a sharper drop in profits or a bigger rise in borrowing costs than we envisage, then these pockets of vulnerability could blow up,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note last week. “Although the global banking system appears to be better placed to deal with such turbulence now than at the time of the global financial crisis, at the very least this could exacerbate any virus-related global downturn.”The White House has invited top Wall Street executives to a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout, according to an official.As recently as January, Federal Reserve officials expressed worry that “financial imbalances — including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness — could amplify an adverse shock to the economy.”Corporate debt has skyrocketed over the past decade, and more than half of investment-grade company debt is just one notch above a “junk” rating, with BBB debt in the United States now totaling more than $3 trillion.

Leveraged loans, which banks and other financial institutions extend to already indebted companies, have also ballooned.

Indexes that track high-yield debt and leveraged loans have had record outflows over the past two weeks, as people take their money and run, seeking safer investments.“We are concerned about potential cracks in the U.S. credit cycle in an environment of dwindling corporate cash flows, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions that feeds back into the real economy,” Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at Pimco, wrote in a research note Sunday.While banks have limited direct exposures to the riskiest loans — which could keep any messiness in that sector from turning into a full-blown financial meltdown — they and the broader economy would still be affected if things soured quickly.“In the event of corporate debt distress, firms may reduce investment and cut payrolls to continue servicing their debt,” according to one 2019 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report. That could make it harder for households and businesses — bank customers — to pay back their own debt, and “banks could incur losses.” “We arrive at this moment with the overleveraged corporate sector about to face the prospect that new-issue bond markets may seize up, as they did last week, and that even seemingly sound companies will find credit expensive or difficult to obtain,” Mr. Minerd wrote in a note on Sunday.

That could make it harder for households and businesses — bank customers — to pay back their own debt, and “banks could incur losses.” And the financial crisis was painful, in part, because banks stopped lending, leaving consumers without access to cash. They could do that fairly abruptly in 2020 in part because of a new accounting standard, called current expected credit losses methodology.The rule took hold for big banks this year, and forces them to value loans over their lifetime — a measure meant to more accurately gauge risk, but one that could also make projected losses look more drastic when the economy is worsening. The change is expected to dissuade lenders from extending new mortgages and lines of credit during times of stress.“To avoid huge accounting losses, which cut into capital, the effect would be to not lend, or to lend less,” said Joshua Ronen, an accounting professor at New York University. That could “paradoxically” hit the most strapped borrowers, he said, since they are often the worst credit risk.Strains to the financial system could come at a particularly bad time. Big financial firms outside the banking sector remain largely out of regulatory oversight, including asset managers, hedge funds, private equity firms and big insurers.And the rules governing regulated institutions have become gradually less stringent. The Fed made a regulatory change last week, which one official — the Fed governor Lael Brainard, an Obama administration pick — warned could significantly reduce capital at the biggest banks.Fed officials had already expressed concern in January that banks might be returning too much of their profits to shareholders, leaving them exposed if there is another big downturn. “Planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in capital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks,” according to minutes of the meeting.Banking regulators have also been working to relax the Volcker Rule, which prohibited banks from making risky bets with their customers’ deposits. Banks took major losses on their derivatives holdings in the 2008 crisis, helping to exacerbate financial system strains. Proposed changes would allow banks to invest in some credit funds and sponsor or take ownership stakes in venture capital funds, which pool ultrarich investors’ money to bet on start-ups.

Under the Obama administration, the council determined that four large non-bank companies, including American International Group, were “systemically important,” meaning those firms would be subject to Fed oversight.Under Mr. Mnuchin’s leadership, the council has released those firms from federal oversight and abandoned efforts to designate any other firm as “systemic.” It has opted instead to assess whether any financial “activities” pose risks to the system. None have been identified.And the Office of Financial Research, an independent agency created in 2010 to serve as an early warning system for emerging risks, has been gutted and marginalized over the past three years, with Mr. Mnuchin recommending that the agency become a “functional part of Treasury,” with its director chosen by the Treasury secretary rather than the president. “We are in a much more fragile situation than we should be because the regulators haven’t been on the job,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform. “This is a real economic crisis we’re facing.”Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, warned in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week that the country faced a potential “economic calamity.” He called on Mr. Mnuchin to work with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which he chairs, to come up with a plan.“I am concerned that you and your fellow regulators on the council have repeatedly failed to take action to make the financial system more resilient, putting our economy at risk as we experience the first period of financial stress under your watch,” Mr. Brown wrote.Mr. Mnuchin has been criticized for weakening safeguards put in place to prevent a repeat of 2008, when regulators were largely caught off guard by the severity of losses at financial firms, including those outside the banking sector.Congress created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify risks to the financial system and respond to emerging threats.

The agency’s staff has been slashed by more than 50 percent since 2017 to 96 employees, and its role has been relegated to largely assisting the Financial Stability Oversight Council, rather than collecting and analyzing data to identify emerging economic threats across financial sectors, according to current and former officials.“Once Trump took office, every day they have been finding ways to deregulate and weaken the financial regulatory structure,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “They clearly are not prepared for a financial crisis, no matter what precipitates it.”Mr. Mnuchin tried to calm markets at a congressional hearing last week by arguing that this would not be 2008 all over again and that any economic slowdown caused by the virus would quickly abate.“This is very different than the financial crisis,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “There will be an end in sight.”Bank lobbyists have seized on the coronavirus as a reason to usher in even more deregulation.The Bank Policy Institute published a memorandum this month suggesting several measures that regulators could take to help financial institutions expand lending during trying times — including carrying out the streamlined capital rules, which the Fed did just days later.Gregg Gelzinis, senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said the ideas represented a longstanding wish list for big banks.“In their eyes, when the economy is booming it’s as good a time to deregulate as when the economy is experiencing some stress,” Mr. Gelzinis said. “It’s always a good time to roll back rules on Wall Street.” The agency’s staff has been slashed by more than 50 percent since 2017 to 96 employees, and its role has been relegated to largely assisting the Financial Stability Oversight Council, rather than collecting and analyzing data to identify emerging economic threats across financial sectors, according to current and former officials.“Once Trump took office, every day they have been finding ways to deregulate and weaken the financial regulatory structure,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “They clearly are not prepared for a financial crisis, no matter what precipitates it.”Mr. Mnuchin tried to calm markets at a congressional hearing last week by arguing that this would not be 2008 all over again and that any economic slowdown caused by the virus would quickly abate.“This is very different than the financial crisis,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “There will be an end in sight.”Bank lobbyists have seized on the coronavirus as a reason to usher in even more deregulation.The Bank Policy Institute published a memorandum this month suggesting several measures that regulators could take to help financial institutions expand lending during trying times — including carrying out the streamlined capital rules, which the Fed did just days later.Gregg Gelzinis, senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said the ideas represented a longstanding wish list for big banks.“In their eyes, when the economy is booming it’s as good a time to deregulate as when the economy is experiencing some stress,” Mr. Gelzinis said. “It’s always a good time to roll back rules on Wall Street.”","Financial System Faces Biggest Test Since 2008 as Coronavirus SpreadsThe Trump administration has chipped away at the post-crisis regulatory system, moves that could expose financial system vulnerabilities if the economic threat from the virus intensifies.By Alan Rappeport and Jeanna Smialek",2020-03-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/us/politics/financial-regulations-coronavirus.html,new_york_times
"WASHINGTON — Financial markets plunged on Thursday in the biggest one-day drop since the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987, and Congress neared a deal with the White House on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the colossal effect of the coronavirus pandemic.After a day of intense negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that “we’ve resolved most of our differences” and the House would vote on Friday on the measure “one way or another.” It would then go to the Senate, which called off a recess that had been scheduled for next week in anticipation of a compromise.The legislation, according to a letter Ms. Pelosi sent to her members, will include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, aid for food assistance programs and federal funds for Medicaid. The package also ensures 14 days of paid sick leave, as well as tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses fulfill that mandate. Language was still being drafted for provisions related to family and medical leave, according to a Democratic aide, as staff members worked through the night to prepare the bill.Ms. Pelosi, in her letter to lawmakers, also said that the House would soon pursue another package “that will take further effective action that protects the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.” WASHINGTON — Financial markets plunged on Thursday in the biggest one-day drop since the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987, and Congress neared a deal with the White House on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the colossal effect of the coronavirus pandemic.After a day of intense negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that “we’ve resolved most of our differences” and the House would vote on Friday on the measure “one way or another.” It would then go to the Senate, which called off a recess that had been scheduled for next week in anticipation of a compromise.The legislation, according to a letter Ms. Pelosi sent to her members, will include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, aid for food assistance programs and federal funds for Medicaid.

The Federal Reserve, in a drastic attempt to ensure Wall Street remained functional as volatility roiled even normally staid bond markets, said it would promptly inject as much as $1.5 trillion in loans into the banking system and broaden its purchases of Treasury securities. But neither the Fed’s actions, nor a plan by the European Central Bank to offer cheap loans to banks and step up its bond-buying campaign, were enough to assuage investors, who sent the S&P 500 down 9.5 percent.President Trump, for his part, appeared to be scrambling to persuade the public that things were going smoothly, while suggesting he could further restrict travel. Speaking at the White House, Mr. Trump said he could conceivably ban domestic travel to regions of the United States where the coronavirus becomes “too hot.”His comments came on the heels of his abrupt decision Wednesday night to impose sweeping travel restrictions on non-American citizens from nearly all of continental Europe, a step that angered his foreign counterparts and contributed to the global stock sell-off.

The N.C.A.A. announced there would be no March Madness this year as Major League Baseball postponed the start of its regular season by at least two weeks, canceling spring training games effective immediately. The N.H.L., N.B.A. and Major League Soccer also said they would pause or suspend their seasons.“It’s the right thing to do but obviously it stinks,” the Florida Panthers center Aleksander Barkov said in a telephone interview.European leaders were struggling with how to respond, both to the outbreak on their shores and to Mr. Trump, who did not consult them before blocking most visitors from continental Europe to the United States for 30 days.

In a strongly worded statement, the European Union said it “disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.” It said that it was “taking strong action to limit the spread” of the coronavirus, but that it “is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.’’Asked on Thursday why he had not consulted foreign leaders beforehand, Mr. Trump said, “We had to make a decision, and I didn’t want to take time.”The administration’s approach has sown confusion at home, with conflicting messages emanating from the White House and health officials as well as from individual government agencies.In a meeting at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Trump sought to play down the pandemic and its effects on the financial markets, saying, “It’s going to work out fine.” He insisted, “Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth,” even as the government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, was on Capitol Hill acknowledging to lawmakers that “it is a failing — I mean, let’s admit it.” In a strongly worded statement, the European Union said it “disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.” It said that it was “taking strong action to limit the spread” of the coronavirus, but that it “is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.’’Asked on Thursday why he had not consulted foreign leaders beforehand, Mr. Trump said, “We had to make a decision, and I didn’t want to take time.”The administration’s approach has sown confusion at home, with conflicting messages emanating from the White House and health officials as well as from individual government agencies.In a meeting at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Trump sought to play down the pandemic and its effects on the financial markets, saying, “It’s going to work out fine.” He insisted, “Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth,” even as the government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, was on Capitol Hill acknowledging to lawmakers that “it is a failing — I mean, let’s admit it.” The president claimed that anyone who wanted to board a flight to the United States must first test negative for the virus, although there is no such policy. And he said a rally that he had been planning in Tampa, Fla., was “all sold out,” even though the idea of scheduling it was scrapped before it was ever announced.Mr. Trump himself may have been exposed to the virus after coming into contact with a Brazilian official who tested positive just days after participating in meetings with him in Florida.

Cabinet officials have been waiting for the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to send out official guidance addressing changes to telework policies, when to impose mandatory telecommuting, whether to reconsider hosting meetings and gatherings, and whether to cancel travel — guidance that would allow them to change their own policies.The lack of a clear, consistent response in the United States has only fueled the market sell-off, and this week the messiness extended to even the safest bonds, putting financial functioning at risk and prompting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to take significant steps on Thursday to show markets that it has their backs. The New York Fed increased the size of its repurchase operations — basically short-term loans to banks — by $1.5 trillion through Friday, added to its weekly repurchase offerings, and shifted its Treasury purchases so that they extend across durations instead of focusing on shorter-term bills.The package was meant to calm Treasury markets, where conditions had deteriorated in recent days, in part by making sure that as banks take bonds onto their balance sheets, they can have access to the funding they need to cover those positions. That the Fed is now buying across a range of maturities could help relieve pressures across the market.But investors, along with the public, appeared inconsolable and desperate for Congress to unleash aid that could help either stop the spread of the virus or at least buffet an economic hit that is threatening to tip the United States into recession.

House Democrats had initially scheduled a Thursday vote on their own package, signaling that they were ready to push it through even over Republican objections, and Senate Republicans who denounced the plan faced the prospect of leaving Washington having taken no action to address the widening crisis. “Until there are details on the steps that leadership intends to pursue to remedy the economic effects of the viral outbreak, equity markets will be vulnerable,” said Carl Tannenbaum, the chief economist at Northern Trust.Progress toward a compromise between Democrats and the Trump administration was a remarkable turnaround after a day of doubts — on Wall Street and in Washington — about whether a deal would be possible.

The negotiations hit snags as Republicans balked at the sweeping proposal to provide paid sick leave, something Senate Republicans had already blocked when Democrats sought earlier in the week to bring up a separate bill. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, started the day criticizing Ms. Pelosi’s plan as an “ideological wish list” and indicating that the Senate had no intention of moving ahead with it. But as negotiations proceeded, he faced mounting complaints from Republican senators — including those facing challenging re-election races — who opposed the House Democrats’ plan but were reluctant to leave Washington without voting on something to address the crisis.“A haphazard bill thrown together overnight?” Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, told reporters on Thursday. “We need to be thorough about it.”“The Senate has no business leaving,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said in a speech on the floor. “We shouldn’t leave town until we pass the House package to help workers and support our communities, and President Trump needs to sign it. We need to do our jobs.”Senators did leave Washington on Thursday afternoon, but they planned to return on Monday, even as the coronavirus took its toll on the Capitol, prompting more lawmakers to quarantine themselves and close their offices.

Mr. Trump had no hesitance to kibbitz from the side before he became president, assailing President Barack Obama for not doing enough to stop Ebola, for instance. But his own White House has separated into camps of those who think the administration needs to be doing more and those who share — and reinforce — Mr. Trump’s own view that the news media is overreacting to and creating a panic around the coronavirus.After feeling besieged by enemies for three years, Mr. Trump and some of his advisers view so many issues through the lens of political warfare — assuming that criticism is all about point scoring — that it has become hard to see what is real and what is not, according to people around the president. Even when others with Mr. Trump’s best interests at heart disagree, they find it hard to penetrate what they see as the bubble around him.

Some officials there also denied that he had made extensive efforts to speak with Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence.Among the advisers who share the president’s more jaundiced view is his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who considers the problem more about public psychology than a health reality, according to people who have spoken with him. Mr. Kushner has gotten more involved in the response in recent days, according to three White House advisers. A person close to Mr. Kushner said his views were being misinterpreted, and that he was focused on trying to find answers to the most immediate measures to mitigate the virus’s spread.

After that, Mr. Kushner seized more of a role, spending Wednesday with Mr. Trump, the officials said. One administration official said on Thursday that Mr. Kushner, his wife, Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser who has just returned to the White House, favored Mr. Trump giving Wednesday night’s prime-time address to calm the waters amid rampaging uncertainty and fear. One administration official said on Thursday that Mr. Kushner, his wife, Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser who has just returned to the White House, favored Mr. Trump giving Wednesday night’s prime-time address to calm the waters amid rampaging uncertainty and fear. Ms. Trump, the president’s elder daughter, in particular favored the address, according to three administration officials. But the subject quickly became contentious internally, according to several administration officials. Drafts were written and rewritten, beginning around 5 p.m., with Mr. Kushner seen as in charge as the president’s chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, wrote, and the communications office of the West Wing left out of the discussions.By early evening, only two hours before the camera was to go on, it was still not entirely clear what Mr. Trump was going to say. In a meeting in the Cabinet Room, a number of top officials told the president the speech was a good idea, with a notable exception being the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who said that Mr. Trump ought to wait at least a day or two so as to provide officials with more information. The president told aides gathered in the room, who disagreed on exactly how far he should go in terms of a travel ban from Europe, to come up with something and bring it to him, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events.The health experts were either supportive of or neutral about a proposed ban on some European travelers, even as Mr. Mnuchin disagreed, and so the plan moved forward, with other items — like more specific recommendations for schools and crowds — left unmentioned.When the camera turned on, the president appeared uncomfortable, reading words from the teleprompter in a stiff manner that made no emotional connection to a television audience of millions scared about a virus they cannot see and uncertain about a society rapidly transforming around them.Even with the text on the screen, the president mischaracterized his own policies in a way that required his administration to correct him afterward. Administration officials said there were two errors in the teleprompter text, and one that Mr. Trump garbled as he read it, adding the word “only” in a sentence that was intended to say the ban did not apply to trade and cargo, a line that spooked markets.He referred to the pandemic as a “foreign virus” that “will not have a chance against us” as if it were a hostile nation to be defeated on the battlefield. But while he talked about measures to prop up the economy, he did not discuss the troubles with the availability of testing kits or express understanding of the changes in everyday life affecting so many Americans.

Some close aides did not think the errors in the speech were particularly significant. By Thursday morning, it was clear that the speech had not assuaged the financial markets, which plummeted another 10 percent, the worst single day since Black Monday in 1987. Together with the losses of recent weeks, the markets have now erased about 85 percent of the gains of the entire Trump presidency, gains that were the foundation of his argument for re-election.

Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, which had just harshly criticized the president’s “failures of leadership” in handling the outbreak, saw some progress in the speech even as he expressed concern that it would not last.“The speech represents a marked, welcome improvement in the president’s rhetoric,” he wrote, “but that won’t matter if he goes out and undercuts it tomorrow, and the ultimate verdict on his response will be rendered based on the results.”The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page likewise called the speech “a step toward more realism” but added that Mr. Trump was not forthcoming enough about the scope of the problem.Republicans close to the White House privately laid blame at the feet of Mr. Kushner. A person close to Mr. Kushner described that as unfair, saying that he was merely helping out and that it becomes easier to blame him when things are difficult. And in any case, a partial travel ban on Europe was a bold move that may have been bound to rattle the markets rather than calm them no matter what.The White House insisted that the president’s actions have had the support of health officials, and that local communities should make decisions based on their own conditions. Aides said the speech demonstrated to Americans that Mr. Trump understands the situation and is determined to react strongly to guard their well-being. “Real leadership in this crisis is going to have to come from governors, from public health officials and from institutional leaders,” Rod Dreher wrote on The American Conservative’s website. “We saw tonight that even when Trump is trying to be on his best behavior, he just doesn’t have much of a clue about the nature of the crisis, or how it can best be fought.”Others were more willing to give him some benefit of the doubt.

Speaking on NBC’s “Today” show, Mr. Pence agreed it was wrong to dismiss the outbreak as hype. “Obviously there’s been some irresponsible rhetoric, but the American people should know that President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the people of this country,” he said, without identifying who was responsible for the irresponsible rhetoric.As for Mr. Trump’s call on Washington in his speech to “stop the partisanship,” that lasted just nine hours, at least some of which he was presumably asleep. By dawn on Thursday, he had already tweeted or retweeted attacks on Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. “The reaction has been very favorable across the country,” Mr. Pence said Thursday on Fox News.

In New York City, a city council member called on the city to postpone the special election for the Queens Borough President, which is scheduled for March 24th. “We cannot put our students, voters, and poll workers at risk,” Donovan Richards, the city councilmember and chair of the council committee on public safety, said in a statement.And on Wednesday, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a bill that would “require all states to offer an option for voters to mail in or drop-off a hand-marked, paper ballot” if more than a quarter of states declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus.Yet for the states voting on Tuesday, the preparations for voting in the age of a pandemic have not led to far-reaching changes. Perhaps the most significant shift will be the relocation of polling stations away from areas where older people live, like assisted living facilities.

In Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, 26 polling locations have been moved. Ohio, which has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus, has also expanded curbside drop-off of absentee ballots in response to the outbreak, to help keep those who are vulnerable away from crowds. As of Wednesday, the state had received roughly 336,000 absentee ballot requests. compared with about 328,000 at the same point in 2016.Another worry is the availability of poll workers, a volunteer group that skews older, and whose absence on Election Day could lead to longer lines and bigger crowds. In Ohio, the secretary of state’s office said it had been “proactively requesting additional recruitment from state and local government employees, outside organizations and even college students to step up and serve Ohio as poll workers.”“In fact, as of early this afternoon, we’ve had 582 Ohioans sign up to be poll workers just since Tuesday,” said Jon Keeling, the communications director for Mr. LaRose. “We’ve been thrilled with how many have stepped up.”IllinoisTwo of the largest voting jurisdictions in Illinois, Cook County and Chicago, obtained a court order on Thursday that will allow the counties to issue vote-by-mail ballots to all nursing home residents in their jurisdictions. The order also removes the requirement to send election judges into nursing homes to conduct voting.“Nursing homes around the state are withdrawing as polling places, so local election authorities are relocating polling places and sending out statutorily required notifications to affected voters,” said Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections. He said that included more than 100 locations in the Chicago area.FloridaIn Florida, which has also declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has urged county elections supervisors to move polling places out of assisted living facilities.“That’s problematic,” he told reporters on Wednesday in Tallahassee, the state capital, adding that residents should still be able to vote there, but not the general public.

Those locations asked for the change, but not all senior facilities have, in part because they want residents to have the convenience of voting there, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for Supervisor Peter Antonacci.The department has bought “oodles” of soap, paper towels, rubbing alcohol and wipes, he added. It already had a supply of gloves.“We’re putting signs at every precinct encouraging everybody approaching to wash their hands,” Mr. Vancore said. “We have plenty of Purell hand sanitizer available. The poll workers are being asked and encouraged to wear gloves.”Poll workers will be wiping down voting booths “as they can,” he said.“We’re doing this in real time,” he said of the last-minute changes to cope with the virus. “We’re doing everything we can, and everybody’s working together to make sure the facilities are clean and people are aware.”ArizonaThe Arizona secretary of state’s office has recommended that voters either cast ballots by mail, which should have been postmarked by Wednesday to be safe, or drop off a vote-by-mail ballot at a designated location before polls close on Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office also urged people to cast ballots in person at early-voting sites, which are open until Friday.In a news release on Wednesday, Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state in Arizona, said she wanted to “remind voters to make a plan for participating in this election.” “I think there’s a way to do that,” he said. “That’s a prudent step to take.”The state has temporarily restricted visits to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult family-care homes, long-term care facilities and adult group homes to keep out international and cruise ship travelers and other people who might have been exposed to the coronavirus.In Broward County, where a small cluster of coronavirus cases has been tied to the Port Everglades seaport, the elections department plans to move six polling places out of assisted living facilities.

And while the virus may depress in-person turnout, he said, his county has already seen a surge in mail-in votes.“Of course turnout will suffer a little bit, but we’ve already got more ballots cast by Democrats in this Democratic presidential preference election than we had cast by Democrats in 2016,” he said. “And it is going to go even higher, and we haven’t hit Election Day.”Reid J.

Public schools are closing and mass gatherings are being canceled. The National Collegiate Athletic Association called off its March Madness tournaments. The stock market took a historic plunge on Thursday.And yet polls show that many voters still don’t see the virus as a serious threat. How much it worries you depends heavily on your personal politics — to a degree that’s not typical for a national crisis.In a Quinnipiac University poll released this week, roughly six in 10 Republican voters nationwide said they were not especially concerned that the coronavirus would disrupt their lives. Two-thirds of Democratic voters said the opposite. All together, a slight majority of Americans expressed serious concern.

Geography could play a role, as Democrats are more likely to live in cities, which are the sites of the worst outbreaks. But this partisan divide may well be linked to the kind of media people consume: While most newspapers and TV networks are treating the crisis as a dire threat and covering local governments’ efforts to contain it, many right-wing pundits are casting doubt on the virus’s risks and even its very existence — following a precedent set by President Trump, who has played down the danger of the virus.On his nationally syndicated radio show, Sean Hannity wondered aloud on Wednesday if the coronavirus might be a “fraud” — just hours before Mr. Trump delivered a televised address about the virus.

During that speech, Mr. Trump announced a temporary partial ban on travel to the United States from Europe, but he stopped short of instituting nationwide limits on public gatherings or the kind of other federal guidance that some world leaders have given to their countries. Over all, Americans are skeptical of Mr. Trump’s ability to confront the crisis. Last month, before the virus had spread throughout the United States, 62 percent of voters nationwide said they were not very confident in the federal government’s ability to deal with it effectively, according to a Fox News poll. Democratic voters were more than twice as likely as Republicans to say that they had no confidence at all.For weeks, Mr. Trump oscillated between reassurances that he had the situation under control and suggestions that the whole issue was vastly overblown. Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party’s leading presidential candidate, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have called the situation grave and pushed for an aggressive response.Mr. Biden and his leading rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, canceled in-person rallies this week and announced online campaign events in their stead. On Thursday, both candidates strongly criticized Mr. Trump’s address to the nation.“Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president,” Mr. Biden said. He offered his own plan to combat the crisis while condemning what he called Mr. Trump’s “colossal” failure to guarantee citizens access to coronavirus testing.For Mr. Trump, the perception that he is a strong leader has been central to his appeal since the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign. Gallup regularly asks Americans about their feelings about the president on a range of personal qualities. Out of the seven qualities Gallup tests, only one applies to Mr. Trump in the eyes of a majority of Americans: being a strong and decisive leader. When Mr. Biden attacks him over the coronavirus, he is taking a cut at Americans’ view of Mr. Trump as a forceful leader.But the virus may have an effect on Mr. Trump’s public approval in ways that ripple far beyond his direct response to the crisis — particularly as the economy absorbs the severe impact of the virus.Before the outbreak, Americans were more likely to describe themselves as satisfied with the way things were going in the country than at any point in the past 15 years, according to Gallup polling. Mr. Trump’s approval ratings have been in the mid- to high 40s in recent months — among the highest numbers of his presidency — lifted by the thriving economy.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Friday to drastically speed up coronavirus testing, approving a commercial test that will allow many labs around the country to begin processing as many as 4,000 samples a day, and introducing an emergency hotline for laboratories.The administration also announced new partnerships with companies developing tests that can detect the virus within an hour.The Food and Drug Administration enlisted Roche, a Swiss health care giant, in the testing effort, giving the global drug manufacturer emergency permission to sell to labs the first commercially approved test for the coronavirus in the United States. That should help expand the scope and speed of coronavirus screening.

That should help expand the scope and speed of coronavirus screening. Combined, the moves signaled the federal government was rushing to catch up with overwhelming demand for more testing capacity, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbed and hospitals began to be stretched thin by surges in patients. As of Friday morning, there were at least 1,660 cases of coronavirus confirmed by lab tests and 41 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The global death toll topped 5,000. Combined, the moves signaled the federal government was rushing to catch up with overwhelming demand for more testing capacity, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbed and hospitals began to be stretched thin by surges in patients. As of Friday morning, there were at least 1,660 cases of coronavirus confirmed by lab tests and 41 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The global death toll topped 5,000. The approval of the Roche test means that labs that already have the company’s high-capacity testing equipment — which are widely available in the United States and around the world — will quickly be able to test for the virus. Roche said its commercial test will provide results in three and a half hours. One of its systems, the cobas 8800 System, will be able to test 4,128 samples in 24 hours. Another system, the cobas 6800 System, can run 1,440 tests in 24 hours.The F.D.A. has been criticized by lab directors and public health officials for moving too slowly to allow outside companies and academic labs to develop their own tests for the virus, even as other countries, such as South Korea, have quickly ramped up their testing.

It is important to quickly and reliably detect whether a patient is infected with SARS-CoV-2,” Dr. Thomas Schinecker, chief executive of Roche Diagnostics, said in a statement, using the scientific name for the novel coronavirus.Under pressure from Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the F.D.A. also on Friday granted New York State’s public health department the authority to allow other labs in the state to conduct tests, without having to go through the federal agency.The F.D.A. said a 24-hour emergency hotline would be created to help private and academic labs process and validate tests, and President Trump announced that he would hold a 3 p.m. news conference to discuss his administration’s response to the virus.The news of Roche’s participation came as the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would award over a million dollars to two other companies, DiaSorin Molecular and Qiagen, to speed up the development of one-hour tests. The tests mark a potentially significant overhaul of the current federal diagnostic model, which requires swabs from patients be sent to laboratories for testing.

"BEIJING — China is pushing a new theory about the origins of the coronavirus: It is an American disease that might have been introduced by members of the United States Army who visited Wuhan in October.There is not a shred of evidence to support that, but the notion received an official endorsement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose spokesman accused American officials of not coming clean about what they know about the disease.The intentional spreading of an unfounded conspiracy theory — which recirculated on China’s tightly controlled internet on Friday — punctuated a downward spiral in relations between the two countries that has been fueled by the basest instinct of officials on both sides.The insinuation came in a series of posts on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman who has made good use of the platform, which is blocked in China, to push a newly aggressive, and hawkish, diplomatic strategy. It is most likely intended to deflect attention from China’s own missteps in the early weeks of the epidemic by sowing confusion or, at least, uncertainty at home and abroad.

Conservatives in the United States, in particular, have latched on to loaded terms that have been criticized for stigmatizing the Chinese people. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the “Wuhan virus,” while Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, called it the “Chinese coronavirus.” In response, Chinese officials and state news media have stepped up their criticism of American officials’ comments.Only days before Mr. Zhao’s latest post, the Xinhua news agency published a commentary denouncing “Washington’s poisonous coronavirus politics” and warning that spreading rumors simply encouraged “fear, division and hate.”“Their dangerously irresponsible statements are highly counterproductive at this drastic hour that demands solidarity and cooperation,” the commentary, written by Gao Wencheng, said, “and could be much more menacing than the virus itself.”The coronavirus, according to all evidence, emanated from Wuhan, China, in late December. Scientists have not yet identified a “patient zero” or a precise source of the virus, though preliminary studies have linked it to a virus in bats that passed through another mammal before infecting humans.A senior official of China’s National Health Commission, Liang Wannian, said at a briefing in Beijing last month that the likely carrier was a pangolin, an endangered species that is trafficked almost exclusively to China for its meat and for its scales, which are prized for use in traditional medicine.The first cluster of patients was reported at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and studies have since suggested that the virus could have been introduced there by someone already infected. Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei account for the overwhelming amount of cases and deaths, so there is no scientific reason to believe the virus began elsewhere.Mr. Zhao’s assertion began with a post linking to a video of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert R. Redfield, testifying before the House on Wednesday and suggesting that some flu deaths might have been caused by the coronavirus.

What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your date! US owe us an explanation.”Mr. Zhao appeared to refer to the Military World Games, which were held in Wuhan in October. The Pentagon sent 17 teams with more than 280 athletes and other staff members to the event, well before any reported outbreaks. The Pentagon has had confirmed cases in South Korea and Italy and is bracing for more to emerge, but no illnesses have been tied to American service members from October.Mr. Zhao’s remarks were spread on China’s most prominent social media platform, Weibo, under a hashtag: #ZhaoLijianPostedFiveTweetsinaRowQuestioningAmerica. By late afternoon on Friday, that hashtag had been viewed more than 160 million times, along with screenshots of the original Twitter posts.At the regular briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday, another spokesman, Geng Shuang, sidestepped three questions about whether Mr. Zhao’s suggestion had politicized the crisis and reflected official Chinese policy.He instead noted the statements made by American officials and lawmakers to “smear and attack” China.“We are firmly opposed to this,” he said. “In fact, the international community, including the United States at home, have different views on the source of the virus. What I have been saying in recent days is that the Chinese side always believed that this is a scientific issue and requires scientific and professional opinions.”Claire Fu contributed research. “When did patient zero begin in US?” Mr. Zhao wrote on Twitter, first in English and separately in Chinese. “How many people are infected.

Sanders declared that the crisis “is on a scale of a major war” and argued that “we must act accordingly.” Biden faulted the president’s “adversarial relationship with the truth” and outlined his own multipronged plan for confronting the crisis. He proposed expanding access to free virus testing, helping to increase hospital capacity and speeding up the push for a vaccine.The pandemic has the potential to damage Trump in more than one way. First of all, even as his approval ratings have remained underwater, perceptions that Trump is a strong leader have offered him some safe harbor. Gallup regularly asks Americans for their opinions of the president on a range of personal qualities; the strength of his leadership is the only one on which he consistently receives positive marks.And with the virus sending the stock market into free fall, the country’s thriving economy could soon find itself in a recession. Trump generally gets a positive review from most Americans for his handling of the economy; if the economic picture were to go dark, he could be deprived of one of his major talking points as the 2020 campaign revs up.Trump is working with Congress to craft legislation that will confront both the virus’s economic fallout and national health concerns. As of Thursday night, those negotiations hadn’t yet been resolved.

The debate, which will be hosted by CNN, will take place without a live audience.For the president, the coronavirus is starting to hit close to home. A Brazilian official tested positive soon after meeting last week at Mar-a-Lago with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. That official was part of a delegation led by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was subsequently tested and is awaiting his results. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Trump and Pence had no plans to get tested, adding that they “had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive.”Biden needs to scale up his operation, and to do so, he has hired a new campaign manager: Jennifer O’Malley Dillon.

Michigan’s results were great for Biden — and maybe ominous signs for Trump. No state serves as a better metaphor for the 2016 election than Michigan.Long considered a safe Democratic stronghold, it broke for Trump by just 10,000 votes, contributing to Hillary Clinton’s Electoral College defeat. Clinton underperformed in a range of crucial areas, including with rural voters — who broke for Trump — and African-Americans, who went heavily for Clinton, as expected, but turned out in relatively low numbers. Biden’s win in the Michigan primary this week suggests that something quite different could be in store come November. In what ended up being a warning sign of things to come, Clinton narrowly lost the 2016 Democratic primary there to Sanders. But on Tuesday, Biden trounced Sanders and drew strong support from a broad coalition of voters, including college-educated white women, moderates and those over 45. Staff members are expected to work through the night on the final language of the bill and provisions related to family and medical leave.

"WASHINGTON — As thousands of Americans flee from Europe and other centers of the coronavirus outbreak, many travelers are reporting no health screenings upon departure and few impediments at U.S. airports beyond a welcome home greeting.Since January, officers from Customs and Border Protection have been on heightened alert for travelers who could potentially spread the virus. The Department of Homeland Security has told employees to look for visible physical symptoms and search through their travel documents and a federal database that tracks where they came from. Those customs officers will soon have to spot symptoms among a flood of more Americans funneled to designated airports from multiple countries in Europe, an administration official said, after President Trump announced new travel restrictions on the region this week.But travelers, including some who say they showed visible signs of illness, say screening has been lax. Members of Congress this week grilled senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security over what some described as a porous screening process. And customs officers at airports question how accurately they can pinpoint people with symptoms and what safeguards are being taken to protect their health.Even top officials at the department acknowledge the task of sealing the United States from the virus is impossible.

And customs officers at airports question how accurately they can pinpoint people with symptoms and what safeguards are being taken to protect their health.Even top officials at the department acknowledge the task of sealing the United States from the virus is impossible. “This has never been from Day 1 intended to be a hermetically sealed process,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security. “We are trying to reduce and delay the biggest peak in the virus wave hitting on the United States of America. And all of these steps reduce and delay. They do not stop of the virus.”“Viruses do not care about boundaries,” he said.Maggie McDow, 46, said she had swollen glands when she landed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, one of 11 airports where travelers who have recently been in China or Iran are being funneled. Ms. McDow had flown from London, but before that, she had stopped in South Korea, a coronavirus hot spot.Ms. McDow said she heard plenty of instructions from airport officials for those feeling ill in airports abroad. But when she reached the United States, she said, “There was none of that.” A customs officer stamped her passport, and she was on her way.

“No one asked where I had traveled. I guess they just assumed we all were just coming from London and so no big deal,” Ms. McDow wrote in an email because she was too sick to speak on the phone and has yet to be tested for the coronavirus. “I could have been coughing and feverish, and it seemed no one would have batted an eye.” “This has never been from Day 1 intended to be a hermetically sealed process,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security. “We are trying to reduce and delay the biggest peak in the virus wave hitting on the United States of America. And all of these steps reduce and delay. They do not stop of the virus.”“Viruses do not care about boundaries,” he said.Maggie McDow, 46, said she had swollen glands when she landed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, one of 11 airports where travelers who have recently been in China or Iran are being funneled. Ms. McDow had flown from London, but before that, she had stopped in South Korea, a coronavirus hot spot.Ms. McDow said she heard plenty of instructions from airport officials for those feeling ill in airports abroad. But when she reached the United States, she said, “There was none of that.” A customs officer stamped her passport, and she was on her way.

Mr. Pompeo, now the secretary of state, nixed the proposal for security reasons, though some administration officials were skeptical that Mr. O’Brien’s life would have been in danger. Other administration officials viewed such a trip as a mistake because a visit by a high-ranking American official could bolster the Assad government while probably doing little to prompt it to release Mr. Tice.

Mr. Tice’s family has sought to keep public attention on his case to pressure the government to continue working for his release. Debra Tice, Mr. Tice’s mother, has held news conferences and granted interviews in which she praised Mr. Trump’s focus on the case of her son and other hostages.She recently told the Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the Syrian government had invited an American official to talk about her son’s case but accused “neocons at the State Department” of intervening to stop the trip. It was unclear whether she was referring to Mr. Pompeo. Ms. Tice declined through a spokesman to comment.Critics have accused the Trump administration of missing opportunities to win Mr. Tice’s release. It has made concessions to the Assad government without demanding Mr. Tice’s release or anything else in return, including when administration officials announced in 2017 that they would no longer pursue Mr. Assad’s ouster, and again last year when Mr. Trump abruptly pulled back American forces fighting the Islamic State, essentially giving up much of the land in Syria that the military had seized from the group back to Mr. Assad’s government.Mr. Frerichs’s case is similarly caught up in delicate geopolitical negotiations.

Some officials expressed concern that if Mr. Frerichs is not found quickly, he could be smuggled into Pakistan, making a rescue by American commandos more difficult because of the political sensitivities and potentially treacherous terrain.

"SAN FRANCISCO — The Defense Department said on Thursday that it would re-evaluate the awarding of a $10 billion cloud computing contract to Microsoft after sustained protest from Amazon, which had contended that it lost the deal because of potential interference from President Trump.In a legal brief filed to the Court of Federal Claims, the Justice Department requested the reconsideration after Amazon argued in federal court that its offerings and pricing had been incorrectly assessed by the Pentagon. The Defense Department requested 120 days to reassess the award. The judge in the case, Patricia E. Campbell-Smith, is expected to allow the re-evaluation to go forward, though she has not yet made an official ruling.The reconsideration is the latest twist in the enormous contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, which was considered to be a prize for technology companies.Amazon, a cloud computing giant, had widely been considered the front-runner to win the contract before it was awarded to Microsoft in October.

Amazon then pushed to overturn the decision, arguing that President Trump interfered because of his dispute with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post. The Washington Post has aggressively covered the Trump administration. Doug Stone, an Amazon spokesman, said in a statement on Thursday that the company was “pleased that the D.O.D. has acknowledged ‘substantial and legitimate’ issues that affected the JEDI award decision, and that corrective action is necessary.” He added that Amazon looked forward to action “that fully insulates the re-evaluation from political influence and corrects the many issues affecting the initial flawed award.”Still, the decision does not represent a full victory for Amazon, and the Justice Department said in a court filing that the company would oppose the motion to reconsider the contract award. The motion was based on the issue of pricing, and not whether Mr. Trump interfered with the process.A spokesman for the Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We believe the Department of Defense made the correct decision when they awarded the contract,” said Frank X. Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, adding that the company remains confident that its proposal “is the right choice for the D.O.D.”The Pentagon’s rapid change of position raises the question of whether it suddenly found merit in Amazon’s objections, or whether officials feared that the court action challenging the award would inevitably surface emails or memorandums suggesting Mr. Trump interfered in the selection.But a Defense Department official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the filing would force Amazon to prove the allegations of bias it has leveled against Mr. Trump — a difficult legal challenge.

Although Amazon has sought to depose Mr. Trump and senior Defense Department officials to fight against the award to Microsoft, its legal arguments challenging the way the contract was awarded have focused on how the Defense Department did not accurately assess the way that it would be charged for certain services.In February, Judge Campbell-Smith sided with Amazon on the pricing issue, issuing a temporary injunction that prevented Microsoft from continuing to work with the Defense Department on the contract.The back-and-forth has put the Pentagon in an awkward spot. Last month, speaking to reporters at the Munich Security Conference, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper argued that it was time to abandon challenges and move ahead with building the cloud. Time was of the essence, he said, and American national security was on the line.“It’s important to the war-fighters that we move forward on this contract,” he said. “We have to move forward. It’s gone on too long.”When asked whether he was pressured on who could receive the $10 billion contract, Mr. Esper said, “Look, I’m not going to get into that part, because I don’t talk about my discussions with the president and White House officials.”He said he educated himself about the Pentagon’s transition to the cloud when he took office last year and said he “heard a lot” about the competition to build it, particularly on Capitol Hill, before ultimately recusing himself from the decision over the award because his son works at IBM, one of the companies that bid on the contract.But when a reporter pointed out he had left open the possibility of pressure from Mr. Trump or other aides, he said: “I never felt pressure from the White House.”Kate Conger reported from San Francisco and David E.

Time was of the essence, he said, and American national security was on the line.“It’s important to the war-fighters that we move forward on this contract,” he said. “We have to move forward. It’s gone on too long.”When asked whether he was pressured on who could receive the $10 billion contract, Mr. Esper said, “Look, I’m not going to get into that part, because I don’t talk about my discussions with the president and White House officials.”He said he educated himself about the Pentagon’s transition to the cloud when he took office last year and said he “heard a lot” about the competition to build it, particularly on Capitol Hill, before ultimately recusing himself from the decision over the award because his son works at IBM, one of the companies that bid on the contract.But when a reporter pointed out he had left open the possibility of pressure from Mr. Trump or other aides, he said: “I never felt pressure from the White House.”Kate Conger reported from San Francisco and David E. Sanger from Washington.",Pentagon Asks to Reconsider Awarding Huge Cloud Contract to AmazonThe action came after Amazon had contended that it lost the deal because of potential interference from President Trump.By Kate Conger and David E.

But now, instead of watching the president create drama on cable television from a faraway capital, millions are living it themselves. Like me, they’re facing school closures, travel limitations and an economy gyrating with uncertainty. And, in the midst of it all, there is a presidential election, one in which the ability of the candidates to engage with the public — the most fundamental aspect of politicking — is being thrown into question.Candidates like to talk about that 3 a.m. phone call, that split second when their resolve would be tested.That moment is now. The campaign we’ve all followed for months is over; something very different and deeply unpredictable is beginning.“We are in a time and place where uncertainty is the norm and uncertain events can change the direction of the race on a dime,” said Robby Mook, who ran Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. “The tables can turn quickly.”Over the past 18 hours, we’ve gotten a preview of our new politics. Last night, the country watched President Trump deliver a monotone Oval Office address, only to have various administration officials quickly step in to correct several policies that he had announced.

With his Tuesday night loss in Michigan — a primary he won in 2016 — Senator Bernie Sanders faces pressure to drop out of the race and support the Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.Yet there aren’t many signs Mr. Sanders plans to do so just yet. “It’s not my style to give up,” he told Elizabeth Bruenig this week in Michigan. “I was born with a lot of endurance.” But supporters of Mr. Sanders are taking stock of their candidate, who performed well in the early contests but has since fizzled.“Instead of the Bernie Sanders Revolution,” Michelle Cottle says that Democrats “are opting for the Joe Biden Cuddle, embracing a candidate who is peddling reassurance, unity, moderation, empathy and civility.” And now that Mr. Sanders is most likely on his way out, writes Cottle, “many Democrats are understandably nervous. Mr. Sanders has never been an especially gracious competitor.”The nomination of Mr. Biden would feel as though “the Democratic establishment has successfully marginalized the progressive left,” writes Jamelle Bouie.

"WASHINGTON — As fears mounted this week about the rapid spread of the coronavirus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi swatted away the suggestion of shuttering Congress with a stoic declaration: “We are the captains of the ship. We are the last to leave.”But by Thursday, as the captains of the ship and their crew saw warning signs blinking from the lighthouse — constituents sickened, colleagues quarantining themselves, grim reports about the virulence of the disease — they began to worry that they were in a different kind of vessel.“Members of Congress,” Representative Matt Gaetz said on the House floor, wearing a gas mask for emphasis, “are human petri dishes.”In a cement and marble Capitol complex teeming with tourists, lawmakers and staff members, anxiety around the coronavirus outbreak — the grim, shuddering after realizing you just touched that constituent’s folder and then touched your face type of anxiety — has at last arrived.

Days after his gas-mask-donning stunt, Mr. Gaetz, Republican of Florida, quarantined himself as he traveled with President Trump on Air Force One, after learning that he had had contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus at a conservative political conference outside Washington.Thursday was the day the dam appeared to break. Two Senate aides tested positive for the virus. Offices began to close in waves. And two more Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rick Scott of Florida, chose to go into quarantine. The sergeant-at-arms announced that the Capitol and surrounding office buildings would shut down to visitors. A Democratic congressman’s spokesman announced that his boss, who was exposed to someone who tested positive for the virus, was unable to get a test. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, directed her aides to work from home.“We’re all having a real conversation about the realness of the situation,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, before assuring a reporter, almost as an afterthought: “But don’t panic!” Days after his gas-mask-donning stunt, Mr. Gaetz, Republican of Florida, quarantined himself as he traveled with President Trump on Air Force One, after learning that he had had contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus at a conservative political conference outside Washington.Thursday was the day the dam appeared to break.

Many college-age interns in the House were recalled home by their universities this week, leaving offices stranded during appropriations season, a time when they are normally dispatched to visit hundreds of offices to collect lawmakers’ signatures on official funding requests. In the case of one House office, instead of interns, lower-level aides wearing masks and gloves were sent to collect the signatures.Lawmakers up for re-election privately discussed how they would handle campaigning. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said he had planned to knock on doors on Saturday, but canceled the outing after consulting with his campaign staff.“We were debating, do people want me knocking on their door?” Mr. Coons said.Ms. Pelosi discouraged reporters from bumping elbows as a greeting.“Forget any physical contact,” she said.That is easier said than done in the Capitol, where the coronavirus has created something of a perfect storm. Congress is home to dozens of elderly lawmakers whose sheer age puts them at higher risk, not to mention the fact that they routinely work long hours; crisscross the country by plane; meet with a constantly rotating cast of constituents, lobbyists, donors and experts from around the world; and are by nature eager to shake every hand they see.Then there are their aides, who work on their committees and in their offices and meet with even more people than their bosses do, running reports and memos back and forth to other aides in other offices. It is an entire network of thousands of Type A personalities guided by a belief that they can reason, spin, flatter or glad-hand their way out of any and all problems. And it is all best done face to face, not at a distance.On Thursday, Senate pages could be seen wiping down desks and chairs on the floor, and behind the scenes, enterprising aides bartered their offices’ snacks for hand sanitizer. House administrators have ordered 1,500 new laptops before what could be a crush of demands for technology products as congressional offices begin urging staff members to work from home, according to one Democratic aide familiar with the order. “Don’t touch me!” Senator Pat Roberts, an 83-year-old Republican from Kansas, ordered when he was approached by a reporter off the Senate floor.

House administrators have ordered 1,500 new laptops before what could be a crush of demands for technology products as congressional offices begin urging staff members to work from home, according to one Democratic aide familiar with the order. There were islands of nonchalance — perhaps alarming under the circumstances — amid the worrying.

He said his plan would speed the ability of Americans to be tested for the virus. It includes private partnerships to speed tests to the market and a website designed by Google, where Mr. Trump said potential patients could enter their symptoms and be directed to a drive-through testing center.

A spokeswoman said that the initiative was in its “early stages” and would first be introduced as a prototype in the Bay Area.The president, who has claimed that anyone who wanted a test could get one, also deflected any blame for the testing delays that have hampered the government’s response.“I don’t take responsibility at all,” Mr. Trump said.He brushed off questions about his own possible exposure to the virus. A Brazilian official who visited him last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has since tested positive, but Mr. Trump said he had no symptoms and did not need to be tested. When repeatedly pressed on the matter, he said he was likely to be screened. “Fairly soon,” he said. “We’re working out a schedule.” But later, Google appeared to cast doubt on when or even whether that would be possible.

Delta Air Lines announced it would ground 300 aircraft and reduce capacity by 40 percent, the sharpest cutback in its history.

Senators, who left Washington for the weekend on Thursday, are expected to take up the measure when they return next week. Mr. Trump has signed off on it. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in a statement after the vote that “senators will need to carefully review” the bill passed by the House.“But I believe the vast majority of senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers, families and small businesses,” he said.

The shape of the paid leave benefit — and how many workers could have access to it — proved to be a sticking point in negotiations on Friday between Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Democrats agreed to drop a provision that would have created a permanent paid sick leave entitlement in case of a public health emergency. Republicans sought to confine it only to people who were sick or caring for ill family or children kept out of school.Ms. Pelosi characterized the bill on Friday evening as an intermediate step.“As the Senate works to pass this bill,” she wrote in a letter to colleagues, “the House will begin work on a third emergency response package to protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.”In Europe, officials announced a series of aggressive measures to support their economies and try to contain the virus’s spread.

Mr. Trump’s moves and the aid bill was considered progress in the effort to slow the virus’s spread and minimize damage to the economy.But they still fell far short of the steps that many economists say lawmakers must take to confront a crisis with little precedent in American history — one that is likely to require Mr. Trump to marshal a rapid bipartisan response.His difficulty in doing so was evident on Friday. Shortly after stock trading closed for the day, the president cast doubt on the aid package that had been negotiated painstakingly by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin.

Shortly after stock trading closed for the day, the president cast doubt on the aid package that had been negotiated painstakingly by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin. “We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough” in negotiations, he said. (Ms. Pelosi, asked why she didn’t speak to Mr. Trump about the bill, said that “there was no need for that.”)A senior administration official said that the president was referring to the $1 trillion temporary cut in payroll taxes, an idea that lawmakers from both parties have viewed with skepticism. “We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough” in negotiations, he said.

Still, talks continued as the afternoon progressed. As Mr. Trump was criticizing Democrats, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin were speaking for the 10th time of the day about the legislation. Ms. Pelosi announced the deal after they concluded their 13th call, and shortly after Mr. Mnuchin met privately with the president to urge him to accept it.In the hours after that, the deal seemed in peril as White House officials insisted they were still reviewing text and aides rushed to make technical changes.“Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” Mr. Trump tweeted just before 9 p.m., giving the first indication that he backed the measure and wanted Republicans to vote for it.Any delay could further imperil an economy that many forecasters are persuaded is entering a recession, caused by the damage the virus has already inflicted on global supply chains and the growing chill from homebound consumers pulling back on their spending.

Some economists say that to contain the spread of the virus, the country must effectively hit pause on entire sectors of commerce, like entertainment and dining, that bring Americans together in large crowds. Those economists say Congress and Mr. Trump must help workers and small-business owners weather that shock — and give them enough cash to help kick-start spending and hiring again once the virus is contained and daily routines begin to return to normal.“The approach has to be, let’s make this as short and sharp as we can,” said Steven Hamilton, an economist at George Washington University who has recently called for policymakers to rethink traditional government stimulus efforts that focus largely on tax cuts or spending programs, and instead supply hundreds of billions of dollars in direct assistance to workers and small business owners.

The United States economy is going to need to shut — I mean, shut everything — for two to six weeks.”That sort of abrupt halt in activity will particularly hurt small-business owners who lack the cash reserves or access to credit that larger companies enjoy. It will also slam lower-income workers, many of whom do not have paid leave, or work in industries like hospitality that are suffering acutely from the pandemic — or both.By limiting the number of people gathering in common spaces, traveling by public transit systems, and coming into direct contact with one another, it may be possible to substantially slow the spread of the virus, experts say.Studies of cities and states that have required employers to offer paid sick leave show substantially lower rates of influenza during flu season, a sign that the provision does reduce the spread of illness. Many economists, including conservatives and liberals, applauded the inclusion of a paid leave provision in the House bill.“Good economic policy starts by ensuring that the humans in the economy stay well — and alive — so they can participate in the economy as both producers and consumers,” said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality and growth. “We need to focus on this basic first principle right now.” “It’s the worst public health crisis in a century,” Mr. Hamilton said. “The world has never faced anything like this.

"As he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump attempted to deflect criticisms of his administration’s response to the virus with inaccurate claims. Here’s a fact-check.what the facts areMr. Trump wrongly blamed the Obama administration for coronavirus testing shortages and falsely said it “didn’t do testing” during the swine flu epidemic of 2009.What Mr. Trump Said“I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time.”False. The Food and Drug Administration issued a “draft guidance” in 2014 in which it sought to extend its authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests. But it’s wrong to blame that effort for the scattered and insufficient delivery of coronavirus tests as the guidance was not particularly relevant to emergency situations and was never finalized or generally enforced.A law enacted in 2004 created the process and requirements for the use of unapproved products in public health emergencies. Under the law and guidance set by the Trump administration itself, the Food and Drug Administration requires developers of laboratory-developed tests to submit information and to comply with certain procedures.

Under the law and guidance set by the Trump administration itself, the Food and Drug Administration requires developers of laboratory-developed tests to submit information and to comply with certain procedures. The agency said in early March that it would permit unapproved tests for the coronavirus for 15 days while developers are preparing their emergency authorization request. Neither the 2004 law nor subsequent amendments restricted the Trump administration from doing so, nor did it hamper previous administrations in fast-tracking testing for other health crises.What Mr. Trump Said“If you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t do testing like this, and actually they lost approximately 14,000 people, and they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late.”False. This is blatantly wrong. Diagnostic tests for the swine flu were approved and shipped out less than two weeks after the H1N1 virus was identified and a day before the first death in the United States.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the first case of the virus on April 14, 2009. The Obama administration declared swine flu a public health emergency on April 26. The Food and Drug Administration approved a rapid test for the virus two days later. At the time, the C.D.C. had reported 64 cases and zero deaths. The C.D.C. began shipping test kits to public health laboratories on May 1 (at 141 cases and one death) and a second test was approved in July. From May to September 2009, the agency shipped more than 1,000 kits, each one able to test 1,000 specimens.To be sure, researchers found flaws and limitations in the tests but testing was conducted. A vaccine became available in early October but, amid reports of shortages, President Obama declared the outbreak a national emergency later that month. The estimated death toll in the United States from the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010. The agency said in early March that it would permit unapproved tests for the coronavirus for 15 days while developers are preparing their emergency authorization request. Neither the 2004 law nor subsequent amendments restricted the Trump administration from doing so, nor did it hamper previous administrations in fast-tracking testing for other health crises.What Mr. Trump Said“If you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t do testing like this, and actually they lost approximately 14,000 people, and they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late.”False. This is blatantly wrong. Diagnostic tests for the swine flu were approved and shipped out less than two weeks after the H1N1 virus was identified and a day before the first death in the United States.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the first case of the virus on April 14, 2009. The Obama administration declared swine flu a public health emergency on April 26. The Food and Drug Administration approved a rapid test for the virus two days later. At the time, the C.D.C. had reported 64 cases and zero deaths. The C.D.C. began shipping test kits to public health laboratories on May 1 (at 141 cases and one death) and a second test was approved in July. From May to September 2009, the agency shipped more than 1,000 kits, each one able to test 1,000 specimens.To be sure, researchers found flaws and limitations in the tests but testing was conducted. A vaccine became available in early October but, amid reports of shortages, President Obama declared the outbreak a national emergency later that month. The estimated death toll in the United States from the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010. What the Facts AreMr. Trump inaccurately described a website in development to mitigate the outbreak.What Mr. Trump Said“I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website, it’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”This is misleading. Mr. Trump misstated the company developing the website and exaggerated its scope. After Mr. Trump spoke, Google issued a statement on Twitter from Verily, a separate subsidiary of Google’s parent company.“We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,” the statement read.A spokeswoman for Verily said it had originally intended for the website to be used only by health care workers. Mr. Trump’s statement prompted the company to make it available to the public. The site will direct people to “pilot sites” for testing in the Bay Area, the spokeswoman said. If the pilot goes well, Verily aims to deploy the project nationwide, but there is no timetable for a national rollout.what the facts areMr. Trump again mischaracterized travel restrictions imposed on certain European countries.What Mr. Trump Said“As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now and we closed that border a while ago.”This is misleading. Mr. Trump imposed some travel restrictions on 26 European countries on Wednesday night, but those restrictions do not go into effect until midnight on Friday and do not amount to a total shutting down of the border.The restrictions bar the entry of foreign nationals who have been to any of the 26 countries that make up Europe’s Schengen Area of open borders within 14 days. That area does not include more than 20 other European countries, including Britain. The proclamation also does not apply to American citizens, permanent residents, their immediate families, or those who are members of air or sea crews.

The proclamation also does not apply to American citizens, permanent residents, their immediate families, or those who are members of air or sea crews. what the facts areMr. Trump described telemedicine technology as “fairly new,” though it’s been used for decades.What Mr. Trump Said“This includes the following critical authorities — the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that has happened in the not-so-distant past.”This is exaggerated. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded access to telehealth services — for example, virtual check-ins and telephone consultations with doctors — for Medicare beneficiaries this week. But these technologies have been in use since the 1960s.The University of Nebraska used video links to provide exams and diagnoses with a state hospital 112 miles in 1964. Three years later, the University of Miami and a local fire department transmitted cardiac rhythms using radio channels. Federal agencies initiated a host of other services in the 1970s and 1980s.A 1997 government report noted a severely injured sailor aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln was able to be treated by a doctor in San Diego 6,000 miles away through telemedicine. By 2014, “more than 20 federal agencies were engaged in some aspect of telehealth,” according to the Congressional Research Service, with the Department of Veterans Affairs providing more than 2.1 million telehealth consultations in the 2015 fiscal year.what the facts areMr. Trump said he was not responsible for disbanding the White House’s pandemic team.what Mr. Trump said“When you say me, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could ask — perhaps my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it.”This is misleading. The top White House official tasked with leading the country’s response to a pandemic left the administration in May 2018 and his team was disbanded by Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at the time, John R. Bolton, The Washington Post has reported.While there is no evidence that Mr. Trump personally directed the ousting of these officials, he also did not replace them in the nearly two years since, despite repeated bipartisan urgings from lawmakers and experts. what the facts areMr. Trump described telemedicine technology as “fairly new,” though it’s been used for decades.What Mr. Trump Said“This includes the following critical authorities — the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that has happened in the not-so-distant past.”This is exaggerated.

What the Facts AreMr. Trump announced his administration would temporarily waive interest on some student loans.What Mr. Trump Said“To help our students and their families, I have waived interest that all student loans held by federal government agencies, and that will be until further notice.”This needs context. Interest rates will be temporarily waived for borrowers, but their monthly payments will not actually decrease, according to a Department of Education spokeswoman. Instead, borrowers’ full payments will go toward the principal on their loans.The waiver also does not cover student loans issued through state agencies, big private lenders, a majority of Federal Family Education Loans or school-held Perkins loans.Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

"WASHINGTON — There was one big question looming on Friday over the Rose Garden, where President Trump held an afternoon news conference and announced new emergency measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.As Mr. Trump introduced a line of chief executives and public health officials, praising their efforts and those of his administration, the mystery was the president’s own health. Would Mr. Trump, 73, be tested after interacting with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after meeting with him in Florida?On an issue that seemed cut and dry, yes or no, Mr. Trump hedged.First he insisted that he did not have any symptoms, and noted that getting tested might set a bad example. “We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test,” he said.Then a reporter questioned whether Mr. Trump was disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S.

In fact, he said, he did plan to get tested “fairly soon,” but not because of his exposure to an infected individual.“Not for that reason,” he said, without providing another reason for the test that until now he appears to have resisted. “I think I will do it anyway. Fairly soon. We’re working out a schedule.”

But hours later, just before midnight, the White House physician released a statement saying Mr. Trump would not be tested — nor would he self-quarantine — even as it became apparent that he had interacted with not one but with at least two infected members of the Brazilian delegation that visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last weekend.Mr. Trump’s interactions with the infected individuals qualified as “LOW risk,” wrote Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, so quarantine was not recommended. He added that because the president continued to show no symptoms of the virus, “testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” Other medical experts have recommended testing for asymptomatic people who could still spread the virus to others. “I think they shouldn’t be jumping to get the test unless it’s necessary, but I think they have to listen to their doctors,” the president said.But when pressed again on the issue, Mr. Trump equivocated.

He added that because the president continued to show no symptoms of the virus, “testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” Other medical experts have recommended testing for asymptomatic people who could still spread the virus to others. Pressure on Mr. Trump to get tested has been growing since he came into contact with Fabio Wajngarten, a top communications aide to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who tested positive days after a visit last weekend to Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. At Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Wajngarten participated in meetings with the president and posed for a photograph with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Two more Brazilian officials who were pictured at an outdoor table with Mr. Trump said Friday night that they had also tested positive for the virus.Senators Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both announced on Thursday plans to self-quarantine because of potential contact with Mr. Wajngarten, and Mr. Bolsonaro was also tested for the virus. He announced Friday that he had tested negative.But Mr. Trump said he was dubious of Mr. Wajngarten’s condition, and on Friday played down his interactions with him. “There was somebody that they say has it,” he said. “I have no idea who he is. I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds.”In one photograph, which Mr. Wajngarten posted on social media, the Brazilian official is standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Trump, who is clutching a brown “Make Brazil Great Again” baseball cap.ImageThe pictured posted by Fabio Wajngarten.Credit...via Associated PressA video from the event also showed Mr. Wajngarten standing directly behind Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro as they addressed a crowd. Dr. Conley conceded in his letter that Mr. Trump had “spent more time in closer proximity” with one of the other dinner guests who later tested positive.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, declined to say whether any members of the president’s family or his administration would undergo testing.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not respond to questions about whether he would submit himself to a coronavirus test. Mr. Trump’s news conference took place on a warm, springlike day, with cherry blossoms blooming, a balmy backdrop that belied the anxiety gripping the nation. Governors across the country had ordered schools to close, and people nationwide had been ordered to work from home indefinitely.At the news conference, Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said nursing homes should temporarily restrict all visitors and nonessential personnel from their facilities.But Mr. Trump and the clutch of aides that stood around him seemed like they were beaming in from a less precarious time and place. For all of the recommendations about social distancing and the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to replace handshakes with elbow taps, the president insisted on shaking hands with the chief executives who joined him on the dais.Behind Mr. Trump, the group huddled closely together, not six feet apart, as guidance suggests.When the chief executive of a medical home visit company offered Mr. Trump the recommended elbow bump instead of his hand, the president chuckled. “I like that,” he said, as if it were the first time he was witnessing the gesture.The news conference, which Mr. Trump announced earlier in the day on Twitter, was something of a do-over, after his Oval Office address on Wednesday evening, which was filled with inaccuracies and was generally seen as a failed opportunity to demonstrate leadership or offer guidance during a time of crisis.On Thursday, advisers planned an announcement that new tests for the coronavirus would be available soon, hoping it would put to bed recriminations about the insufficient availability of test kits that has left health officials largely blind to the virus’s domestic spread. But Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Hope Hicks, a top adviser who recently returned to the White House, were still working with the president on the details of his announcement until curtain time.And the tone quickly shifted when Mr. Trump took questions from reporters.“I don’t take responsibility at all,” the president said when pressed about whether he was responsible for delays in testing. He also claimed to have no knowledge of why, in 2018, his administration dismantled a pandemic response team that was once part of the National Security Council.

He also claimed to have no knowledge of why, in 2018, his administration dismantled a pandemic response team that was once part of the National Security Council. “It’s a nasty question,” Mr. Trump shot back. “You say we did that. I don’t know anything about it.”The president’s defensive responses echoed how he began his day, when he blamed President Barack Obama for a severe shortage in test kits — a charge that did little to rebut critics who say that his administration has moved too slowly to ensure a mass national testing ability.“For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.”The president also pointed to the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States that left more than 12,000 people dead, saying that Mr. Obama had mismanaged it.“Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now,” he continued. “The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!”But Mr. Obama’s acting health secretary declared a public health emergency in April 2009, when only 20 known cases of the virus existed and before anyone in the United States had died of it. Mr. Obama declared a national emergency six months later, after hundreds of fatalities.Former Obama officials said that Mr. Trump was making false charges which, even if true, would not account for his failure to act sooner.“This is a typical Trump move to blame the previous administration,” said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a former White House health policy adviser. “We are now more than three years into his administration. He’s had plenty of time to rectify any problems. So it’s hard to blame someone else.”Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Michael Crowley from Washington. “It’s a nasty question,” Mr. Trump shot back. “You say we did that. I don’t know anything about it.”The president’s defensive responses echoed how he began his day, when he blamed President Barack Obama for a severe shortage in test kits — a charge that did little to rebut critics who say that his administration has moved too slowly to ensure a mass national testing ability.“For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.”The president also pointed to the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States that left more than 12,000 people dead, saying that Mr. Obama had mismanaged it.“Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now,” he continued. “The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!”But Mr. Obama’s acting health secretary declared a public health emergency in April 2009, when only 20 known cases of the virus existed and before anyone in the United States had died of it. Mr. Obama declared a national emergency six months later, after hundreds of fatalities.Former Obama officials said that Mr. Trump was making false charges which, even if true, would not account for his failure to act sooner.“This is a typical Trump move to blame the previous administration,” said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a former White House health policy adviser. “We are now more than three years into his administration. He’s had plenty of time to rectify any problems. So it’s hard to blame someone else.”Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Michael Crowley from Washington.","Trump Won’t Be Getting a Coronavirus Test, His Doctor Says",2020-03-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-emergency-coronavirus.html,new_york_times
"The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s recent primary victories has obscured an important schism within the Democratic Party: between the older voters who carried Mr. Biden to victory and the younger voters who overwhelmingly rejected him.The dividing line is around age 45, and it is as stark as a flipped switch. In some states on Tuesday, Mr. Biden won two-thirds or more of voters older than 45, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won about two-thirds of voters younger than that.Comparatively low turnout among young voters helped save Mr. Biden in the primaries. But in the general election, a similar lack of turnout could become a huge liability — a point Mr. Sanders made explicitly on Wednesday as he announced that he would continue his campaign at least through the next debate on Sunday.“I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,” Mr. Sanders said. “You must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.” The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R.

Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo on Wednesday that winning in November would depend on bringing young voters in. And Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, said at a fund-raiser in Illinois last week that her husband was talking to his staff about “engaging the youth vote and coming up with some youth advocacy.”But Mr. Biden has been campaigning for nearly a year to represent a party that young voters often prefer, and his lack of support among those voters has been evident for a long time.“What I’m a little nervous that we’re in the middle of right now is a repeat of 2016,” said Sarah Audelo, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, who worked on Hillary Clinton’s campaign and said it did not invest enough in outreach to young voters during the primaries. “What that meant was the campaign had to start from scratch in the general, and that is not something Joe Biden can afford to do.”The New York Times spoke with more than 30 young Democrats from 17 states this week, ranging in age from 17 to 34. Most of them said they had voted for Mr. Sanders or planned to do so if he stayed in the race through their state’s primary. Some had voted for Senator Elizabeth Warren before she dropped out. Only two said they wanted Mr. Biden to be the nominee.And while many said they would reluctantly vote for Mr. Biden in November for the sake of beating President Trump, about a third said they would consider staying home or voting for a third-party candidate unless Mr. Biden made significant concessions to the party’s left wing.

They were well aware of his plans to address climate change, student debt and other issues that matter to them — plans that would help Mr. Biden appeal to young voters, his wife said. But those plans, the young Democrats said, were not the solution to the generational gap among the candidates’ supporters; they were a cause.“The plan the Biden campaign put forward for climate change is nowhere near good enough to save our Earth,” said Benjamin Brumer, 28, who lives in California and said he felt hopeless about his future under either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden. “It will be hard, if not impossible, for them to convince me to vote for Biden. But a good first step toward reconciliation would be to make bolder promises for solving climate change.”Lindsay Huber, 29, who lives in Oregon, said that at an “absolute bare minimum,” to win her vote, Mr. Biden needed to stop accepting super PAC money and endorse both “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal.“And it would still be difficult to trust that he’s being truthful, because he has decades of racist, sexist, corporatist, warmongering votes,” Ms. Huber said. “To win us back, the Democratic Party needs to actually listen to us and serve us. Or else they need to die and we will create a new party ourselves.” They were well aware of his plans to address climate change, student debt and other issues that matter to them — plans that would help Mr. Biden appeal to young voters, his wife said.

And that is not what many young voters are looking for.“The Republican Party has moved farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, which leaves this huge vacuum, I feel, for younger people who actually want to be a part of a truly progressive movement,” said Hajar Khalid, 20, a student at Columbia University.Ms. Khalid said she supported Medicare for all and would feel somewhat better about voting for Mr. Biden, should he win the nomination, if he had a more comprehensive health care plan or if he chose a truly progressive running mate.“I want to say that despite all of this, I will still vote for the Democratic Party in the general no matter who it is,” she said. “But it’s really hard to say that when the other candidate is Joe Biden, who doesn’t have any real attractive attributes and whose main message seems to be: ‘I won’t change anything to help progressive causes, really, but at least I’m not Trump.’”Beyond the disconnect between young progressives’ ideals and Mr. Biden’s more moderate proposals, there is also a deeper problem: While Mr. Sanders has actively engaged with young people, Mr. Biden has never given much indication that he is seeking their votes at all. At times, he has appeared openly disdainful or condescending toward them.Groups that work with young voters said winning their votes would require speaking more to the policies they want to see enacted, but also considering them in event planning, advertising and communications.

Of course I would. But young voters didn’t turn out in the primaries to support him. That’s our generation’s mistake. We can’t make that same mistake in the general election.”There are many reasons young people are less likely to turn out, ranging from structural obstacles — including voter suppression on college campuses — to disillusionment or distaste for all of the available candidates. But one rationale that came up repeatedly this week was that they did not want to be taken for granted.Democrats assume progressives will vote for them “even as they ignore and dismiss the policy positions most young and progressive voters care about, and yet enough people voted for Jill Stein to lose Hillary the election in multiple key states,” said Sam Anderson, 25, a New Yorker who plans to vote only in down-ballot races unless the party crafts a more progressive platform and Mr. Biden chooses a progressive running mate.“I worry, win or lose, that the party will learn nothing from this election and continue to dismiss the concerns and policy goals of the younger generation they rely upon,” Mr. Anderson said. “The most I can do to influence that at this point is simply not vote and reduce the margin of victory in New York.”Katie Glueck contributed reporting. “It’s going to be up to the campaign to craft messages for young people and develop a really good surrogate program,” said Anne Moses, founder and president of Ignite, which encourages young women to enter politics. “I don’t think Biden is the best person to speak directly to young people.”The lack of political attention is a tremendous source of frustration for young people: both those who are considering not voting because they feel they are being ignored, and those who are angry with their peers for not voting because it perpetuates their exclusion.“Biden and other Democrats would be more receptive to young people if they actually voted,” said Ariel Schwartz, 21, a student at SUNY New Paltz. “Would I like a candidate like Bernie Sanders, who puts young people at the forefront?

"The coronavirus outbreak is inflicting new disruptions on the 2020 presidential campaign by the day, but few compare to Louisiana’s decision on Friday to reschedule its upcoming primary election.It was a highly unusual development in an American political campaign, though not an entirely unprecedented one.So how much disruption can voters expect in the coming months? And how freely can local, state and federal authorities switch up the timing and other details of elections? We took a crack at answering some of the questions that may be on your mind.Why is Louisiana moving its primary election?Louisiana’s secretary of state, R. Kyle Ardoin, a Republican, asked Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, to postpone the state’s April 4 primary by about two months because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.

It is possible, however, that some later-voting states could follow Louisiana’s example.While a last-minute change like Louisiana’s is highly unusual, states have broad autonomy to define the timing and procedures for primary elections. The exact process for setting primary dates varies from state to state. That is why a number of states changed the dates of their primaries and caucuses between 2016 and 2020, and why Republicans in several states were able to cancel their 2020 primary elections to minimize intraparty competition for President Trump.

It would take a change in federal law to move that date. That would mean legislation enacted by Congress, signed by the president and subject to challenge in the courts. To call that unlikely would be an understatement.And even if all of that happened, there would not be much flexibility in choosing an alternate election date: The Constitution mandates that the new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s term must begin on Jan. 20. Those dates cannot be changed just by the passage of normal legislation.After Louisiana’s announcement on Friday, Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer, knocked down what he described as a wave of queries about whether the November election could be similarly revised.“I am getting a lot of questions about the November election,” Mr. Elias wrote on Twitter. “While states can set their own primary days, the federal general election is set by federal statute as the the [sic] Tuesday following the first Monday in November. This date cannot be changed by a state nor by the President.” To call that unlikely would be an understatement.And even if all of that happened, there would not be much flexibility in choosing an alternate election date: The Constitution mandates that the new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s term must begin on Jan. 20.

So it is possible that states could revise their voting procedures in response to a public health crisis, perhaps by making it easier to vote by mail or through various absentee procedures that would not require people to cluster together on one particular date.Washington State, a focal point for the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, has conducted elections by mail for years, and its presidential primary on March 10 was able to unfold without disruption.The federal government could also take steps to mandate or encourage different voting procedures, without changing the timing of the election. Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, has proposed that Congress require states to offer “no excuse absentee balloting” for the general election, so that anyone can opt to vote by a method besides in-person voting on Election Day.

Have American elections been moved because of emergencies in the past?Yes, at the state and local level.Perhaps most notably, the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks came on the morning of a municipal primary election in New York City, and the state Legislature passed emergency legislation postponing the election by two weeks. In 2017, some municipal elections in Florida were briefly delayed because of Hurricane Irma.It was reported in 2004 that some Bush administration officials had discussed putting in place a method of postponing a federal election in the event of a terrorist attack. But that idea fizzled quickly, and Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, said that the United States had held “elections in this country when we were at war, even when we were in civil war. And we should have the elections on time.” Have American elections been moved because of emergencies in the past?Yes, at the state and local level.Perhaps most notably, the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks came on the morning of a municipal primary election in New York City, and the state Legislature passed emergency legislation postponing the election by two weeks.

And we should have the elections on time.”","Could the 2020 Election Be Postponed? Only With Great Difficulty. Here’s Why.With Louisiana delaying its primary vote, we answer six key questions about holding elections in a crisis.

"President Trump made overhauling the federal judiciary one of his top priorities, moving with particular speed to infuse the highly influential appeals courts with reliably conservative judges.Working with his Republican allies in the Senate, he installed 51 judges in just three years — appointing more than a quarter of the appellate bench at a record pace.The New York Times conducted a deep examination of the new judges to obtain a collective portrait of the group. It included interviews with people close to the nomination process, a review of biographical information submitted to the Senate by Mr. Trump’s appointees and those of his last two predecessors, former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and an analysis of published decisions and dissents by the judges.The article on the findings can be found here. These are some of the takeaways about the new judges.They have deeply conservative credentials, and they aren’t shy about themMuch like Mr. Trump himself, many of the new judges break longstanding conventions and have backgrounds that differ significantly from those named by Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.

They were more openly engaged in conservative causes important to Republicans, such as opposition to gay marriage and to government funding for abortion. They often have political experience on their résumés, including posts in the federal government. They also more typically donated money to political candidates and causes.All but eight had ties to the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that has been central to the White House’s appointment process and ascendant in Republican circles in recent years for its advocacy of strictly interpreting the Constitution.They are more likely to be young, white and male, and they have elite schoolingThese are lifetime appointments, and Mr. Trump has put a premium on appointing young judges.Thirty-three percent were under 45 when appointed, compared with just five percent under Mr. Obama and 19 percent under Mr. Bush. The median age was five-and-a-half years younger than it was under Mr. Obama, and three-and-a-half years younger than under Mr. Bush.Mr. Trump has also reversed a trend of increasing diversity on the appellate bench under Mr. Obama. Two-thirds of Mr. Trump’s appointees are white men.Many of the appointees have elite credentials, with nearly half having trained as lawyers at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago or Yale, and more than a third having clerked for a Supreme Court justice. That surpasses the appointees of both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.

That surpasses the appointees of both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush. They made it to the bench because Republicans in the Senate sidelined DemocratsIn less partisan times, many of the new judges, with their polarizing paper trails and histories of fighting for Republican causes, would have lacked a clear path to confirmation because of Senate customs meant to ensure bipartisan consensus over judicial nominees.But some of those customs have been tossed aside, allowing Republicans, who control the Senate, to get their way even when Democrats object.Two-thirds of the new appellate judges failed to win the support of 60 senators, historically a requirement of consensus that was first jettisoned by the Democratic-controlled Senate midway through the Obama administration.When Republicans gained the majority, they followed suit and took the custom-breaking even further. They did away with a courtesy that allowed senators to sign off on nominees for courts in their home states. That meant Mr. Trump did not have to compromise on his picks in states with a Democratic senator; about a third of his appointees did not get the signoff.They can be disagreeable on the bench, but mostly when working with a colleague appointed by a DemocratThe Times analyzed more than 10,000 published decisions and dissents since Mr. Trump took office and found that his appointees continued to stand out after they joined the bench.There is a culture of consensus in most appellate courts, and in the cases reviewed by The Times, judges appointed by presidents of both parties agreed with one another the vast majority of times. But when they did not, the Trump appointees made a difference.They were notably more likely than their peers on the bench to agree with Republican appointees and to disagree with Democratic appointees — suggesting they are more consistently conservative.

On panels of three judges that had members appointed by presidents of the same party, dissent occurred just 7 percent of the time. The rate jumped to 12 percent on panels that included a mix of judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.But when a Trump appointee wrote an opinion for a panel with a lone Democrat, or served as the only Republican appointee, the dissent rate rose to 17 percent.That means the likelihood of a split decision was nearly 1.5 times higher when a Trump appointee heard the case.They are tilting the balance in courts in New York and elsewhere toward judges appointed by RepublicansAbout a third of the new judges have taken seats formerly occupied by appointees of Democratic presidents. As a result, the judges have forged new majorities of Republican appointees in three appellate circuits, including those based in Atlanta, New York and Philadelphia.The Trump appointees have also significantly narrowed the edge held by appointees of Democratic presidents in the largest and most reliably liberal circuit, the Ninth, based in San Francisco.While federal judges of all stripes take an oath of impartiality and reject the notion that they do a president’s bidding, there is an ideological divide between liberal and conservative jurists about how best to interpret many laws and the Constitution. An unequal split between Democratic and Republican appointees can give a court a distinct reputation as liberal or conservative.

This was their path to confirmation.By The New York Times",2020-03-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/appellate-judges-trump-appointees.html,new_york_times
"As a Republican candidate for the Texas Supreme Court, Don R. Willett flaunted his uncompromising conservatism, boasting of endorsements from groups with “pro-life, pro-faith, pro-family” credentials.“I intend to build such a fiercely conservative record on the court that I will be unconfirmable for any future federal judicial post — and proudly so,” a Republican rival quoted him telling party leaders.Judge Willett served a dozen years on the Texas bench. But rather than disqualifying him, his record there propelled him to the very job he had deemed beyond reach. President Trump nominated him to a federal appeals court, and Republicans in the Senate narrowly confirmed him on a party-line vote.As Mr. Trump seeks re-election, his rightward overhaul of the federal judiciary — in particular, the highly influential appeals courts — has been invoked as one of his most enduring accomplishments. While individual nominees have drawn scrutiny, The New York Times conducted a deep examination of all 51 new appellate judges to obtain a collective portrait of the Trump-populated bench.

While individual nominees have drawn scrutiny, The New York Times conducted a deep examination of all 51 new appellate judges to obtain a collective portrait of the Trump-populated bench. The review shows that the Trump class of appellate judges, much like the president himself, breaks significantly with the norms set by his Democratic and Republican predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.The lifetime appointees — who make up more than a quarter of the entire appellate bench — were more openly engaged in causes important to Republicans, such as opposition to gay marriage and to government funding for abortion.They more typically held a political post in the federal government and donated money to political candidates and causes. Just four had no discernible political activity in their past, and several were confirmed in spite of an unfavorable rating from the American Bar Association — the first time that had happened at the appellate level in decades.Two-thirds are white men, and as a group, they are much younger than the Obama and Bush appointees.Once on the bench, the Trump appointees have stood out from their fellow judges, according to an analysis by The Times of more than 10,000 published decisions and dissents through December.When ruling on cases, they have been notably more likely than other Republican appointees to disagree with peers selected by Democratic presidents, and more likely to agree with those Republican appointees, suggesting they are more consistently conservative. Among the dozen or so judges that most fit the pattern, The Times found, are three Mr. Trump has signaled were on his Supreme Court shortlist.

While the appellate courts favor consensus and disagreement remains relatively rare — there were 125 instances when a Trump appointee wrote the majority opinion or dissent in a split decision — the new judges have ruled on disputed cases across a range of contentious issues, including abortion, immigration, L.G.B.T. rights and lobbying requirements, the examination shows.

One new judge, who had held a political job in the Trump administration, dissented on an issue of particular importance to the president: disclosure of his financial records. The judge, Neomi Rao, opposed a decision requiring the release of the documents to a congressional committee, a mandate the president continues to resist and is now before the Supreme Court.“They have long records of standing up, and they’re not afraid of being unpopular,” said Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group that has pushed for the mold-breaking appointments. Ms. Severino once served as a law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the Supreme Court’s most reliably conservative members.Stephen B. Burbank, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump’s appointments reflected attempts by recent presidents to draw the federal judiciary — a constitutionally independent branch of government — into policy debates more appropriate in Congress and the White House.“The problem as I see it is not that judges differ ideologically — of course they do — nor is it that a Republican president would look for someone with congenial ideological preferences,” Mr. Burbank said. “It’s that in recent decades the search has been for hard-wired ideologues because they’re reliable policy agents.”Mr. Trump has appointed more judges to the appeals courts, where eight of the nine current Supreme Court Justices served, than any other president during the first three years in office. Also known as circuits, the 13 courts are the last stop for federal cases before the Supreme Court, and nearly all federal litigation ends there.

The Times examination was based on interviews with dozens of people close to the nomination process, including some of Mr. Trump’s appointees; the analysis of thousands of published decisions and dissents since Mr. Trump became president; a review of detailed biographical and financial questionnaires submitted by all 168 appellate judges named by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, as well as their records, public statements and campaign contributions since 1989.Judicial appointments, a standard measure of a president’s legacy, almost always draw partisan scrutiny, as Republicans tend to appoint conservative lawyers who interpret the Constitution according to what they say was its original meaning, and Democrats lean toward liberal appointees with a more expansive view. But Mr. Trump’s record is particularly striking because of the divisive atmosphere, the examination shows, and the president’s disruptive approach to governing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and none of the judges contacted by The Times would agree to be quoted.

When Mr. Trump took office there were 103 unfilled federal court openings, in addition to a Supreme Court seat, in part because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader of the Senate, and allies had refused to proceed with confirming many of Mr. Obama’s nominees. The last time so many vacancies had been left to a successor of the opposing party was when the federal bench was expanded by dozens of judges under President George H.W. Bush.Mr. Trump wasted no time in seizing the opportunity. During his first three years in office, with Mr. McConnell’s assistance, he was able to name nearly as many appellate judges as Mr. Obama had appointed over two terms.And he did so with great political flourish. More than one-third of the Trump appointees have filled seats previously occupied by judges appointed by Democrats, tipping the balance toward conservatives in some circuits that include largely Democratic states like New York and Connecticut. Even in the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit, a reliably liberal appeals court, Mr. Trump has significantly narrowed the gap between judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents.With Republicans and Democrats in Congress retreating to their corners, many of the Trump appointees have benefited from Republicans’ decision to extend a contentious and partisan confirmation path that upended bipartisan Senate practices.

Two-thirds of the new appellate judges failed to win the support of 60 senators, historically a requirement of consensus that was first jettisoned by the Democratic-controlled Senate midway through the Obama administration because Republicans were blocking nominees to the D.C. Circuit. After he became majority leader, Mr. McConnell followed suit when Democrats initially blocked Mr. Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.About a third did not receive the signoff of both home-state senators, a courtesy for a nomination to move forward that was tossed aside in late 2017 by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, then the Judiciary Committee’s Republican chairman. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley’s successor in that role, carried the decision forward. Crucially, that meant Mr. Trump did not have to compromise on his appellate picks in states with a Democratic senator.Just two found unanimous support across the aisle, a sharp drop from both the Obama and Bush nominees.According to a tally by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, Mr. Trump’s appointees across the judiciary have drawn three times more “no” votes in the Senate than all confirmed judges in the 20th century combined. So far, Mr. Trump has appointed more than 185 federal judges.On the appellate bench, Mr. Trump’s appointees have drawn nearly twice as many “no” votes as did those of Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, The Times’s analysis shows.

In a history-making intervention, one of Mr. Trump’s appellate picks was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 deadlock. It was Mr. Pence’s 12th tiebreaking vote in the Senate, the most of anyone in his office since the 1870s, and the only time a vice president installed a nominee to the bench.

Kobes, had been working on Capitol Hill as an aide to a Republican senator. He was rated unqualified by the American Bar Association, which questioned his ability to reflect “complex legal analysis” and “knowledge of the law” in his writing.He got the job anyway, with Mr. Grassley proclaiming on Twitter in December 2018 that the confirmation had “made HISTORY.” Judge Kobes became Mr. Trump’s 30th confirmed appointee to the appellate bench.Democrats, powerless to block the nominees, have been sidelined as angry bystanders.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called Mr. Trump’s appellate appointees “far outside the judicial mainstream,” adding that she believed Republicans were using them to advance “a particular agenda.” She voted against all but 14 of the appellate nominees.”Americans are certainly aware of Supreme Court nominations,” Ms. Feinstein said in a statement to The Times, “but most don’t pay close attention to the lower courts, which can have an even more direct effect on their lives.”From Fringe to MainstreamMr. Trump has staked his presidency on upending conventions, and his approach to the judiciary breaks sharply with that of past presidents.He unapologetically views judges as agents of the presidents who appointed them — calling out an “Obama judge,” for instance, for ruling against the Trump administration in an immigration case. He frequently attributes his popularity among Republicans to his judicial appointments. And he has not been shy about politicizing the process.“95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party,” he wrote on Twitter in January. “Thank you! 191 Federal Judges (a record), and two Supreme Court Justices, approved. Best Economy & Employment Numbers EVER. Thank you to our great New, Smart and Nimble REPUBLICAN PARTY. Join now, it’s where people want to be!” The judge, Jonathan A.

Roberts Jr. recently described an independent judiciary as “a key source of national unity and stability” — the examination by The Times shows that the Trump administration has filled the appellate courts with formidable allies who fought for a range of issues important to Republicans.Democratic presidents have also sought out reliable political allies when filling some judicial posts, but Mr. Trump’s approach has left little to chance.His appointees include former litigators who argued against legalizing same-sex marriage; advocated blocking Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers performing abortions; argued that corporations with religious owners could not be required to pay for insurance coverage of certain forms of birth control; and supported the Trump administration’s choice to include a question about citizenship on the census.In the past, many conservatives have been left disappointed when judges appointed by Republican presidents were seen to have lost their resolve on the bench. Now what matters most with Mr. Trump’s appointees, said Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, is that they come with rock-solid conservative résumés.“You have to demand a paper trail — no more skeleton nominees,” said Mr. Blackman, who advised the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican, and is a strong supporter of the Trump approach.

One standout appointee, Kyle Duncan, now an appellate judge in New Orleans, fought to uphold Louisiana’s gay-marriage ban before the Supreme Court, defended a North Carolina law restricting transgender people from using their preferred bathrooms and represented Hobby Lobby when it sued the federal government over the requirement that it provide employees with insurance coverage for some birth control.

He had worked as general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group that has been a strong defender of the religious right.Responding to questions from senators about the North Carolina law, he said he had been “advancing not my own personal beliefs but legal arguments on behalf of my client’s interests, just as I have done in every case to the best of my ability.”Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the federal appeals court in Philadelphia, last September emphasized the independence of judges once they took the bench, saying, “We certainly are not viewing ourselves as members of teams or camps or parties.”Many of the appointees have elite credentials, with nearly half having trained as lawyers at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago or Yale, and more than a third having clerked for a Supreme Court justice, surpassing the appointees of both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.But Mr. Trump’s appellate picks often have less judicial experience, The Times found. About 40 percent previously served as a judge, compared with more than half of the Bush and Obama appointees.Mr. Trump named some of his judges before they received a rating from the American Bar Association, which Republicans have long viewed as biased against their nominees. Three deemed unqualified were confirmed — a step not taken at the appellate level since at least 1975, when a former governor of Connecticut nominated by former Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford joined the bench, according to Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist focusing on the judiciary.

Mr. Trump is betting that the judges will back Republican priorities for a long time: The median age of the appointees is five-and-a-half years younger than it was under Mr. Obama, and three-and-a-half years younger than under Mr. Bush. Thirty-three percent were under 45 when appointed, compared with just five percent under Mr. Obama and 19 percent under Mr. Bush. And countering a trend of increasing diversity on the appellate bench under Mr. Obama, two-thirds of Mr. Trump’s appointees are white men.

And countering a trend of increasing diversity on the appellate bench under Mr. Obama, two-thirds of Mr. Trump’s appointees are white men. They are also well off: Their median net worth is nearly $2 million — adjusted for inflation, that is on a par with the worth of Obama appointees, and about a half-million dollars more than that of Bush appointees.Perhaps most telling, all but eight of the new judges have had ties to the Federalist Society, a legal group that has been central to the White House’s appointment process and ascendant in Republican circles in recent years for its advocacy of strictly interpreting the Constitution.Nearly twice as many appointees have had ties to the group as did those of Mr. Trump’s most recent Republican predecessor, Mr. Bush. Early this year, a proposal was circulated among federal judges by the court system’s ethical advisory arm that would ban membership in the group.

He also had more than 25,000 posts on Twitter that often focused on current affairs and Republican politics, even some jabbing Mr. Trump as a candidate.During the last Republican administration, under Mr. Bush, he had advised judicial nominees “to bob and weave, be the teeniest tiniest target you can be,” Judge Willett said during a speech in 2010, adding, “You want to be as bland, forgettable and unremarkable as possible.”No more. The Trump approach has translated into a new breed of appellate appointees with open experience in ideological and political warfare.John Malcolm, a conservative legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, said he was looking for “people who have the strength of their convictions.” He drew up a list in 2016 of recommended Supreme Court nominees that was embraced by Mr. Trump.About three-quarters of Mr. Trump’s appellate appointees donated to political candidates and causes, a significantly higher proportion than Mr. Obama’s and slightly ahead of Mr. Bush’s, according to an analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in Politics and the Center for Responsive Politics. “We have seen our views go from the fringe, views that in years past would inhibit someone’s chances to be considered for the federal bench,” he said, “to being the center of the conversation.”Battle-Tested ConservativesJudge Willett, the former Texas Supreme Court justice, had a paper trail replete with political connections and ties to prominent Texas Republicans when he was nominated to the federal bench in 2017.He had raised over $4 million for two campaigns for the state bench, more than half of it from lawyers, lobbyists and oil interests, according to the National Institute on Money in Politics.

Judge Rao had run a regulatory office in the White House. Judges Steven J. Menashi and Gregory G. Katsas had worked in the office of the White House counsel. Judge Patrick J.

At least eight actively fought against legalizing gay marriage, and at least as many argued for immigration positions now embraced by the Trump administration.

As solicitor general of Montana, according to published emails, he encouraged the state’s attorney general to support a 20-week abortion ban in Arizona, to defend a professional photographer’s refusal to shoot a same-sex commitment ceremony in New Mexico and to challenge a ban on semiautomatic weapons in New York.The fact that Montana was not directly affected by the cases did not matter. In an email to the solicitor general in Alabama — who would also be named to the appellate bench by Mr. Trump — he wrote about the New York ban: “Semiautomatic firearms are fun to hunt elk with, as the attached picture attests :).” The Great Falls Tribune, which obtained the emails, published a photo of the now-judge in hunting garb.Judge Michael H. Park, another appointee, had come to the support of the Trump administration in its unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the census. As a private lawyer representing the Project on Fair Representation, a conservative group, he argued in 2018 that the question was justified, calling it “immensely helpful to redistricting and voting rights litigation.”The Supreme Court disagreed.

Once on the bench, they quickly confirmed that they could shake things up. Three on that short list — Judges Joan Larsen, David R. Stras and Amul Thapar — were among those identified by The Times as having a penchant for disagreeing with Democratic nominees. They voted differently from those judges 23 percent of the time, but from judges appointed by Republican presidents only four percent of the time.Judge Larsen and Judge Stras had been state supreme court justices named by Republican governors in their home states. Judge Thapar was elevated by Mr. Trump from a federal district court in Kentucky, where he had been appointed by Mr. Bush.Unlike lower courts, the appellate courts, which review other courts’ decisions, do not have juries. Instead, cases are largely decided by panels of three judges, usually selected randomly from all of the judges in the circuit.There is a culture of consensus in most circuits, and in the cases reviewed by The Times, appellate judges of both parties agreed with one another the vast majority of times. But when they did not, the Trump appointees stood out.On panels that had members appointed by presidents of the same party, dissent occurred just 7 percent of the time. The rate jumped to 12 percent on panels that included a mix of judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.But when a Trump appointee wrote an opinion for a panel with a lone Democrat, or served as the only Republican appointee, the dissent rate rose to 17 percent — meaning the likelihood of dissent was nearly 1.5 times higher if a Trump appointee was involved.

Writing a dissent marks a bold break from fellow members of the bench, experts say, and by definition sets the judge apart. The dissenting opinions can also inform future legal arguments and cases.“You’re going to get some judges who will bite their tongue and say, ‘These are my colleagues — I’m not going to rock the boat unless I feel strongly about it,’” said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education arm of the federal court system.In other instances, however, judges “go in slashing and burning” with no regard for comity — or with an eye to drawing attention to themselves, he said. “Some of them obviously are going to be thinking about the next vacancy on the Supreme Court,” Mr. Wheeler said.In a speech in 2017, Mr. McGahn, the former White House counsel and a main driver of the Trump selection process, said “judicial courage” was as important as judicial independence.The Times analysis included 10,025 opinions of three-judge panels from 2017 through 2019 that were tagged as “published, written and signed” in the federal center’s integrated case database.It covered more than 1,975 cases involving at least one Trump appointee. Because many of Mr. Trump’s earliest appointments occurred in appellate courts dominated by judges named by Republicans, more than half of those cases did not involve panels with judges appointed by a Democrat.Of the 125 cases in which a Trump appointee wrote a dissent or an opinion eliciting dissent, about half involved civil rights or criminal matters. The others touched on a wide variety of topics, from transgender rights to pregnancy discrimination to the limits of police powers.

In one instance, a Trump appointee joined with a Bush appointee to strike down a key part of the Affordable Care Act. A Democratic-nominated judge dissented.Amy Coney Barrett, another judge on Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court shortlist, was among the new appointees who wrote a dissent cited by conservatives.Judge Barrett, a noted originalist, once served as a clerk to former Justice Antonin Scalia. But she stood out among the Trump appointees not by disagreeing with Democratic appointees but by taking on two judges named by former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.The subject was Second Amendment gun rights, and Ms. Barrett took a broader view than her colleagues.The owner of a therapeutic shoe-insert company had pleaded guilty to mail fraud and, as a felon, was barred from owning a gun. He objected, claiming the penalty was unconstitutional.The two Reagan appointees upheld a lower-court ruling against the man. Their decision was based in part on the notion that governments banned felons from owning firearms because they were considered more likely to abuse them.

Their decision was based in part on the notion that governments banned felons from owning firearms because they were considered more likely to abuse them. But in dissenting, Judge Barrett argued that lawmakers could prohibit only violent people from owning firearms, and that the government had not proved that a nonviolent felon would turn violent.“History does not support the proposition that felons lose their Second Amendment rights solely because of their status as felons,” she wrote.A dissent by another new appointee, Judge Rao, the former Trump administration official, staked out territory important to the president and his allies.Two appellate judges, both appointed by Democrats, ruled that Mr. Trump’s accountants had to comply with a congressional subpoena for eight years of his financial records.Judge Rao, who holds the appellate seat vacated by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, questioned whether Democrats in the House of Representatives had overshot their authority. At a hearing on the case, she suggested the Democrats were, in effect, seeking the “regulation of the president.”In her 67-page dissent, she wrote that the subpoena went beyond Congress’s authority, and that the documents in question could be obtained only in an impeachment inquiry.She also chided her fellow judges for allowing Congress to conduct “a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government,” suggesting they had chosen to fixate on worst-case scenarios.

The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court, where two Trump appointees, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch, will help determine its fate.Tipping the BalanceThe push in the Senate last November to confirm a White House lawyer for a top federal judgeship in New York unnerved Democrats.The lawyer, Steven Menashi had a trail of inflammatory writings about feminism and multiculturalism. He had declined to answer specific questions about his role in the Trump administration on family detentions and education policy.And he had managed to get a confirmation vote only because Republicans did away with a courtesy rule letting home-state senators — in this case, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer — block nominees they found unworthy. Mr. Schumer had described him as “a textbook example of someone who does not deserve to sit on the federal bench.”Not only did he get his seat on the Second Circuit, but his appointment marked a signature moment in Mr. Trump’s bid to tilt the nation’s appellate courts to the right: Judge Menashi’s confirmation flipped the balance toward Republican appointees in a circuit encompassing three states — New York, Connecticut and Vermont — dominated at nearly every level by Democrats.Judges named by Mr. Trump have forged new majorities in two other circuits — the Third and the 11th. And they have come close in the nation’s largest appeals court, the Ninth, based in San Francisco, which has long issued rulings favorable to liberal causes.The unequal split between Democratic and Republican appointees can give the circuits distinct reputations as liberal or conservative.

Mr. Trump has called the Ninth Circuit “out of control” and a “complete & total disaster,” and he has suggested that some of its decisions related to immigration and the border have threatened national security.In one case, the court ruled that the Trump administration could not erase Obama-era protections for so-called Dreamers, children brought into the United States illegally.In another, it blocked the administration’s effort to speed up the deportation of asylum seekers. It also rejected Mr. Trump’s policy restricting travel from eight countries, six of them largely Muslim.“Every case that gets filed in the Ninth Circuit, we get beaten,” Mr. Trump complained in 2018. “It’s a disgrace.”At the close of the Obama administration, 18 judges on the circuit had been appointed by Democratic presidents, seven had been named by Republicans and four seats were vacant. Through his appointments, Mr. Trump has whittled the majority held by Democratic appointees to just three making it less likely that a liberal philosophy can dominate so thoroughly.Allies of the president have celebrated. In emails to supporters, the National Organization for Marriage, a group established to fight the legalization of same-sex marriage, lauded the change “from the most liberal court in the country to one that is much more balanced.”Brian S. Brown, president of the group, heralded that Mr. Trump was remaking the court and others across the country. “Judges will be with us for a lot longer than any politician who holds office,” he wrote.

Conservatives have also celebrated Trump appointees in circuits where the balance of power has not shifted. Their votes have proved significant in so-called en-banc hearings — when a decision by a panel of appellate judges is reviewed by a larger group of judges.In 2014, a Louisiana law required doctors performing abortions to be able to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. Opponents of the law predicted a chilling effect on access to abortions. Those in favor argued that it protected women seeking abortions by making sure doctors were competent.

Opponents of the law predicted a chilling effect on access to abortions. Those in favor argued that it protected women seeking abortions by making sure doctors were competent. The case, now being decided by the Supreme Court, has been playing out in federal courts for years. A district court judge struck down the law, but was reversed by a divided three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit. When opponents of the law asked all judges of the circuit to hear an appeal, the request was denied, 9-6, with four judges appointed by Mr. Trump joining the majority.At an en-banc hearing in Missouri, four Trump-appointed judges in the Eighth Circuit joined a 6-5 decision that loosened disclosure requirements for political activists.In the case, a man who ran a nonprofit advocating conservative causes had sued Missouri officials over a lobbying registration law he deemed unconstitutional. He was not a lobbyist, he argued, addressing lawmakers often but not spending or receiving money for it. A lower court and a three-judge appeals panel had sided with the state, requiring him to register out of transparency.Among the four Trump appointees who overturned that ruling were Judge Kobes, the former Senate aide who had been confirmed when Mr. Pence offered up a tiebreaking vote; Judge Stras, who was on Mr. Trump’s shortlist for the Supreme Court; and Judge Grasz of Nebraska.

As he seeks re-election, Mr. Trump has showcased his role in fulfilling the Republican judicial agenda. One afternoon last November, he gathered an array of Republican leaders and conservative judicial activists to celebrate his success.“I’ve always heard, actually, that when you become president, the most — single most — important thing you can do is federal judges,” he said.How the Numbers Were CalculatedIn examining the president’s judicial appointments, The Times compiled two databases of information about judges who were named to the U.S. Court of Appeals by Mr. Trump and his predecessors.One focused on the professional and political backgrounds of judges appointed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush. The other analyzed published opinions in the court’s 12 regional circuits to gain insights into ruling patterns and rates of dissent.The BiographiesThe Times compared the appellate judges’ experiences outside the court. All told, there were 168 appointees — 51 by Mr. Trump, 55 by Mr. Obama and 62 by Mr. Bush.The database drew primarily on biographical questionnaires the appointees had submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, obtained from staff members, the Congressional Record and other sources. They listed jobs and internships held since college, judicial clerkships, club memberships, affiliations with political campaigns and other information. Some judges volunteered more detail than others.Separately, campaign finance data was compiled from two sources: the National Institute on Money in Politics, which has access to state donations since 2000 and federal ones since 2010, and the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations beginning in 1989. In searching the donations, The Times sometimes found matches by using variations of judges’ names, including maiden names, as well as other relevant information like employment.Calculations of partisan donations were based on federal contributions to political candidates or causes of the same party as the judge’s appointing president. Past political activity was measured more broadly and included work for politicians of any party; volunteer or paid work for political campaigns of any party; memberships affiliated with any party; donations to campaigns of any party; participation as a candidate for any party; references to “Republican” or “Democrat” in any answer in the questionnaire; and work in a political post in the federal government, including political duties assigned to a federal employee.The age of judges on their appointment date was based on years of birth provided by the Federal Judicial Center, the official clearinghouse for court research.The Rulings and DissentsThe database includes more than 10,000 opinions published from 2017 through last year in the 12 regional circuit courts. The 13th appeals court, the Federal Circuit, hears mostly intellectual property cases and has no Trump appointees.The case list was published by the Federal Judicial Center. Only cases designated “published, written and signed” were included in the analysis, because they carry the weight of precedence and represent the most legally impactful work. For consistency, all of the cases involved a standard three-judge panel with a named opinion author.For every case, The Times parsed the text of the opinion to identify the judges, whose names are redacted from the judicial center’s data. Additional information about the judges was obtained by joining the case data to a separate biography data set kept by the center.The data was analyzed in two ways: first, to determine how often cases involved a dissent, and second, to determine how often individual judges agreed or disagreed with their two colleagues on a panel.On the case level, the data showed that when a judge named by Mr. Trump served in a pivotal role — as the author of an opinion on a panel with only one Democratic appointee, or as the only Republican appointee on a panel — the rate of dissent increased significantly.For individual judges, the analysis split each panel into three pairings. If the case was unanimously decided, all judges were deemed to have agreed. If one judge dissented, that judge was deemed to have disagreed with the other two. While judges appointed by presidents of different parties were more likely to disagree than judges appointed by presidents of the same party, the difference was far more pronounced for many, though not all, of the new Trump appointees, the analysis found.There were caveats to the findings. Some of the circuits have a higher dissent rate overall, for example, and some circuits appear more often in the database because they conduct a higher share of their work in the form of published opinions.Even accounting for those factors, the findings were supported by a separate regression analysis, which accounted for other variables, including the circuit hearing the case, the topic before the court, the type of appeal and whether the ruling affirmed or overturned a decision by a lower court.Hillary Flynn and Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting. Jack Begg contributed research. As he seeks re-election, Mr. Trump has showcased his role in fulfilling the Republican judicial agenda. One afternoon last November, he gathered an array of Republican leaders and conservative judicial activists to celebrate his success.“I’ve always heard, actually, that when you become president, the most — single most — important thing you can do is federal judges,” he said.How the Numbers Were CalculatedIn examining the president’s judicial appointments, The Times compiled two databases of information about judges who were named to the U.S. Court of Appeals by Mr. Trump and his predecessors.One focused on the professional and political backgrounds of judges appointed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush. The other analyzed published opinions in the court’s 12 regional circuits to gain insights into ruling patterns and rates of dissent.The BiographiesThe Times compared the appellate judges’ experiences outside the court. All told, there were 168 appointees — 51 by Mr. Trump, 55 by Mr. Obama and 62 by Mr. Bush.The database drew primarily on biographical questionnaires the appointees had submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, obtained from staff members, the Congressional Record and other sources. They listed jobs and internships held since college, judicial clerkships, club memberships, affiliations with political campaigns and other information. Some judges volunteered more detail than others.Separately, campaign finance data was compiled from two sources: the National Institute on Money in Politics, which has access to state donations since 2000 and federal ones since 2010, and the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations beginning in 1989. In searching the donations, The Times sometimes found matches by using variations of judges’ names, including maiden names, as well as other relevant information like employment.Calculations of partisan donations were based on federal contributions to political candidates or causes of the same party as the judge’s appointing president. Past political activity was measured more broadly and included work for politicians of any party; volunteer or paid work for political campaigns of any party; memberships affiliated with any party; donations to campaigns of any party; participation as a candidate for any party; references to “Republican” or “Democrat” in any answer in the questionnaire; and work in a political post in the federal government, including political duties assigned to a federal employee.The age of judges on their appointment date was based on years of birth provided by the Federal Judicial Center, the official clearinghouse for court research.The Rulings and DissentsThe database includes more than 10,000 opinions published from 2017 through last year in the 12 regional circuit courts. The 13th appeals court, the Federal Circuit, hears mostly intellectual property cases and has no Trump appointees.The case list was published by the Federal Judicial Center. Only cases designated “published, written and signed” were included in the analysis, because they carry the weight of precedence and represent the most legally impactful work. For consistency, all of the cases involved a standard three-judge panel with a named opinion author.For every case, The Times parsed the text of the opinion to identify the judges, whose names are redacted from the judicial center’s data. Additional information about the judges was obtained by joining the case data to a separate biography data set kept by the center.The data was analyzed in two ways: first, to determine how often cases involved a dissent, and second, to determine how often individual judges agreed or disagreed with their two colleagues on a panel.On the case level, the data showed that when a judge named by Mr. Trump served in a pivotal role — as the author of an opinion on a panel with only one Democratic appointee, or as the only Republican appointee on a panel — the rate of dissent increased significantly.For individual judges, the analysis split each panel into three pairings. If the case was unanimously decided, all judges were deemed to have agreed. If one judge dissented, that judge was deemed to have disagreed with the other two. While judges appointed by presidents of different parties were more likely to disagree than judges appointed by presidents of the same party, the difference was far more pronounced for many, though not all, of the new Trump appointees, the analysis found.There were caveats to the findings. Some of the circuits have a higher dissent rate overall, for example, and some circuits appear more often in the database because they conduct a higher share of their work in the form of published opinions.Even accounting for those factors, the findings were supported by a separate regression analysis, which accounted for other variables, including the circuit hearing the case, the topic before the court, the type of appeal and whether the ruling affirmed or overturned a decision by a lower court.Hillary Flynn and Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.

There will be no live audience and no spin room. One moderator who had potentially been exposed to the virus has bowed out to avoid  spreading it. Debates are often unpredictable, but it is especially hard to game out how this debate featuring a moderate standard-bearer and a liberal challenger will unfold and how people will process it. Hundreds of thousands of viewers, if not millions, will have been personally affected by Sunday, as public gathering spaces are shuttered, schools are closed and on Thursday the stock market plunged by the largest percentage in decades (it snapped back upward on Friday).“It is going to be a different kind of debate,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, an early ally and surrogate for Mr. Biden, said with more than a little understatement.The extraordinary situation offers an unusual challenge and opportunity. It will provide a national platform and audience for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders to preview their own brands of presidential leadership, especially in contrast to that of President Trump, who had spent weeks downplaying the threat that the coronavirus presented.“You have to throw the entire playbook out the window and focus on what people care about because the agenda has shifted dramatically since they were last onstage together,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic communications strategist who worked for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington during his 2020 presidential bid. “It’s like you were preparing to pitch in the World Series and suddenly you found yourself at bat at a key moment.

And in a new moment of “social distancing” should these two septuagenarian men who are in an at-risk age group make a gesture of doing something else entirely — like an elbow bump? “This is a time for leadership and demonstrating that you have the judgment and vision to fix the incompetence that we’re seeing out of the White House,” Ms. Cutter said. “That is job No. 1 in this debate.”Then there are less consequential questions: Will Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, shake hands? And in a new moment of “social distancing” should these two septuagenarian men who are in an at-risk age group make a gesture of doing something else entirely — like an elbow bump? The state of the race itself has been fundamentally upended since the last debate, too.Back then — less than three weeks ago — Mr. Sanders had won the most votes in three consecutive contests and was threatening to seize control of the nominating contest. Now, Mr. Biden has romped through two straight weeks of sizable victories, so much so that Mr. Sanders’s campaign is facing what experts see as a nearly insurmountable delegate climb.Mr. Sanders now trails Mr. Biden by more than 150 delegates after losing four states last Tuesday and 10 the week before. His defeats were so thorough in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan (a state Mr. Sanders won four years ago) that he trailed in every county. The states that vote next week — Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona — are challenging for Mr. Sanders, as well.That difficult math might typically suggest an aggressive new posture for Mr. Sanders, who needs a real restructuring of the race to be successful. But his speech after last week’s disappointing elections — “we are losing the debate over electability” — was widely interpreted as an effort at de-escalation, as he pressed Mr. Biden to win over his liberal supporters on issues ranging from the environment to student debt, repeatedly asking “Joe, what are you going to do?”In his own speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden offered an olive branch to Mr. Sanders and his supporters, thanking them for their contributions to the contest.

Mr. Coons expected more of that approach on Sunday. “I suspect that we will see Joe say he wants to work with Bernie on some of his policy proposals,” Mr. Coons said. But, he said, “if Bernie insists on simply picking up tools and swinging at Joe the whole time, I think it will be harder to do that.”“They have a shared fundamental goal of preventing Donald Trump’s election and the longer that Bernie Sanders spends attacking Joe Biden the more likely he is to undermine the strength of his candidacy against Donald Trump in the fall,” Mr. Coons added.Still, for Mr. Sanders, the rapid spread of the coronavirus and the predicted shortcomings of America’s medical system are shining a spotlight on his signature issue: a universal and government-run health care system.“It’s obviously a health care crisis and so Bernie’s longstanding support for providing affordable health care for everyone through ‘Medicare for all’ is particularly relevant today,” said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Mr. Sanders. “And he is consistently seen as the most trusted candidate on health care.”Mr. Tulchin said the coronavirus’s economic fallout would shape the debate to Mr. Sanders’s benefit, too.“Bernie has a lot of credibility talking about economic issues especially for those being left behind in today’s economy and there are soon going to be millions of more people facing financial challenges,” Mr. Tulchin added. “There are millions of workers who don’t have paid sick leave, millions of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, and if you’re out of work for a few weeks that is potentially catastrophic.”The two candidates offered a preview of their contrasting approaches to the crisis in a pair of speeches on Thursday. Mr. Coons expected more of that approach on Sunday. “I suspect that we will see Joe say he wants to work with Bernie on some of his policy proposals,” Mr. Coons said.

Standing in front of a row of American flags, in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden adopted the scene and serious tone of a statesman, calling for collective action as a country. “The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,’’ he said. “It will affect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike and will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or ZIP code.”Mr. Sanders, speaking from Burlington, Vt., with the state and American flags positioned in front of “Bernie” signage, warned starkly of casualties that could top World War II, while pivoting to his central message of the urgent need for universal health care.“Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on Earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,” Mr. Sanders said.

And rallying support by live stream, a tactic vulnerable to severe technological difficulties, as he discovered on Friday evening.As the sound cut in and out and the audio often came out garbled, Mr. Biden sought to host what his campaign had called a “virtual town hall with Illinois,” in which he spoke to supporters and voters via video in place of an originally scheduled Chicago get-out-the-vote event — or at least, that was the goal.“I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,” Mr. Biden said as he wrapped up his final answer, to a question about whether he supports the Endangered Species Act. (He does, he said. “Oh, I love you,” the questioner replied.) “There’s a lot more to say, but I’ve probably said too much to you,” Mr. Biden added.As the nation confronts the coronavirus crisis, the presidential candidates are facing a new challenge to their pursuit of the Democratic nomination: how to connect with voters during the height of the presidential primary campaign — from a safe distance. Both Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, his chief rival in the primaries, have had to pull back from large-scale events this week and allow their staff members to work from home. For Joseph R.

According to prepared remarks circulated by the campaign, Mr. Biden began the town hall event by discussing the virus, detailing his vision for fighting it and praising the deal reached between the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the White House on a coronavirus relief package. He was also joined at the virtual town hall by Vivek Murthy, the former United States surgeon general who is part of Mr. Biden’s public health advisory committee.“We will overcome this moment,” the prepared remarks for Mr. Biden said. “That will require all of us to be prudent and proactive.

And campaign events are no exception. That’s why we’re connecting with you virtually today.”Mr. Biden fielded questions about health care, too, including about how his plan would deal with the “crisis that we’re all facing right now.” He spoke of his proposal to expand Obamacare with a public option, and took a chance to draw a contrast with Mr. Sanders and his support for “Medicare for all,” a sweeping single-payer system that Mr. Biden has suggested would be unfeasible to pass and put in place.“We need to assure people we can do this quickly,” he said.In another reminder of the gravity of the moment, Mr. Biden’s health advisory committee announced on Friday night that he had not been tested for the virus because he had not shown any symptoms nor were they aware of “any relevant contact with an individual who has tested positive.”The Biden campaign was not alone in seeking to navigate the realities of a radically altered presidential campaign trail landscape on Friday.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders had lamented that he had not been able to hold his signature campaign rallies because of prohibitions on large gatherings. He said the campaign would rely “more on our internet capabilities.”Mr. Sanders said that he too, had not been tested for the coronavirus because he had not presented any symptoms and had not, to his knowledge, come in contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus.

"One night this week an urgent appeal went out to a Facebook group of emergency room doctors. “If you were in charge of the Federal response to the Pandemic what would your recommendations be?” asked Dr. Kurt Kloss, a physician based in New York.The question was hardly theoretical. “I have direct channel,” he added, “to person now in charge at White House and have been asked for recommendations.”That person, he said, is Jared Kushner, a top adviser to President Trump who has become increasingly involved in the administration’s response to the coronavirus and is also the brother-in-law of the doctor’s daughter, the model Karlie Kloss. Ms. Kloss is married to Joshua Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s brother and a venture capitalist who in 2012 helped found a start-up insurer called Oscar Health.“Tonight I was asked by Jared through my son-in-law for my recommendations,” Dr. Kloss wrote on Wednesday evening. “That’s when I turned to you guys my fellow BAFERDs for help.” BAFERD is an acronym for emergency room doctors, joined by a number of expletives.

"WASHINGTON — The entire federal appeals court in Washington said on Friday that it would take up two cases that raised the question of whether and when Congress may sue to resolve a dispute with the president, setting up a double-barreled test for establishing when the judicial branch can resolve disputes over separation of powers.In a terse order, the full appeals court said it would rehear a case involving a House Judiciary Committee subpoena to Donald F. McGahn II, President Trump’s former White House counsel, vacating a 2-1 panel ruling last month that Congress could not sue to enforce its subpoenas of executive branch officials.The full court also said it would immediately take up a case that House Democrats brought against Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin challenging the administration’s use of emergency powers and other extraordinary measures to spend more taxpayer funds on Mr. Trump’s border wall with Mexico than Congress had been willing to appropriate.In the border wall case, a United States District Court judge had sided with Mr. Trump and dismissed the case, saying the House had no standing to bring it. An appeals court panel heard arguments in the case weeks ago but has not yet issued a ruling. The order said that the panel had requested that the full court hear that case since it also raised an issue of standing.

An appeals court panel heard arguments in the case weeks ago but has not yet issued a ruling. The order said that the panel had requested that the full court hear that case since it also raised an issue of standing. The full Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear arguments in both cases on April 28.The cases raise major issues about the scope of the power of Congress to enlist the courts’ aid when lawmakers believe a president is illegally spending funds — defying its constitutional power of the purse — or instructing an aide to illegally ignore a subpoena, defying its constitutional power to conduct oversight of the government.The McGahn subpoena case is particularly important because it could have far-reaching consequences for executive branch secrecy powers long after Mr. Trump leaves office. The now-vacated panel ruling dealt a severe blow to Congress’s ability to conduct oversight when a president is willing to simply stonewall “all” subpoenas, as Mr. Trump has vowed to do.Mr. McGahn was a key witness in the second volume of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, about Mr. Trump’s efforts to obstruct the Russia inquiry. The House wanted to question Mr. McGahn about the same topic.But on Mr. Trump’s instructions, Mr. McGahn defied the House subpoena. The House sued him, seeking a judicial order that he show up to testify, and won in district court in November.

The House wanted to question Mr. McGahn about the same topic.But on Mr. Trump’s instructions, Mr. McGahn defied the House subpoena. The House sued him, seeking a judicial order that he show up to testify, and won in district court in November. The Justice Department filed an appeal, and last month, two of the three appeals court judges on the panel ruled that the Constitution gave the House no standing to file any such lawsuit in what they characterized as a political dispute with the executive branch — a ruling that, if it stood, would cripple the ability of Congress to investigate current and future presidents.Normally, panels of three judges decide disputes that come before federal appeals courts. But litigants who lose at the panel level can choose to appeal to the entire body to have the case reheard. That can be important when the ideological balance between the three-judge panel and the full court is different.The scope of Congress’s power to conduct oversight and seek judicial redress in disputes with the president has no fixed partisan implications; both major parties trade control of both branches, so sometimes a Republican Congress will be battling a Democratic president.But so far, both cases have followed a pattern at both the district and appellate levels. Every judge who sided with Mr. Trump was a Republican appointee, and every judge who sided with Congress was a Democratic appointee. (In similar cases in the past, however, district court judges have sided against presidents of the same party of the president who appointed them.)Notably, the partisan balance on the full appeals court cuts the other way: Seven of the 11 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents.Still, should the full appeals court determine that the House does have standing to bring the lawsuit and order Mr. McGahn to testify, the Justice Department could again appeal to the Supreme Court. There, five of the nine justices are conservative Republican appointees.Depending on how long the case takes to resolve, the presidential election may take place in the interim. In 2008 and 2009, a similar dispute over whether a former White House lawyer for President George W. Bush, Harriet Miers, had to testify in response to a subpoena was resolved without further litigation after Barack Obama succeeded Mr. Bush as president. The Justice Department filed an appeal, and last month, two of the three appeals court judges on the panel ruled that the Constitution gave the House no standing to file any such lawsuit in what they characterized as a political dispute with the executive branch — a ruling that, if it stood, would cripple the ability of Congress to investigate current and future presidents.Normally, panels of three judges decide disputes that come before federal appeals courts. But litigants who lose at the panel level can choose to appeal to the entire body to have the case reheard. That can be important when the ideological balance between the three-judge panel and the full court is different.The scope of Congress’s power to conduct oversight and seek judicial redress in disputes with the president has no fixed partisan implications; both major parties trade control of both branches, so sometimes a Republican Congress will be battling a Democratic president.But so far, both cases have followed a pattern at both the district and appellate levels. Every judge who sided with Mr. Trump was a Republican appointee, and every judge who sided with Congress was a Democratic appointee. (In similar cases in the past, however, district court judges have sided against presidents of the same party of the president who appointed them.)Notably, the partisan balance on the full appeals court cuts the other way: Seven of the 11 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents.Still, should the full appeals court determine that the House does have standing to bring the lawsuit and order Mr. McGahn to testify, the Justice Department could again appeal to the Supreme Court. There, five of the nine justices are conservative Republican appointees.Depending on how long the case takes to resolve, the presidential election may take place in the interim.

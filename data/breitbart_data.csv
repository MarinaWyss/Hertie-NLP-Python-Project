"A group of Conservative party grandees will seek to pass legislation to make Huawei involvement in British telecoms networks illegal, over fears the Chinese may use the equipment to spy on the United Kingdom. Former Cabinet ministers including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, and Owen Paterson will submit an amendment to Boris Johnson’s Telecoms Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill on Tuesday. It would seek to ensure that no equipment provided by companies deemed “high-risk vendors” by the National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), are used in Britain’s communication networks from after December 31st, 2022. Currently, BT, O2, EE, Vodafone, and Three are all using Huawei in the United Kingdom. Tory rebels speaking to the Financial Times said that as many as 40 to 60 MPs could back them, which could be enough to defeat the vote on the government’s bill. Another said that, currently, the number is closer to an ineffectual 20. While the rebel leaders represent the right-wing European Research Group (ERG) faction, there is also support from “centrist” SO-CALLED One Nation Tories such as Tom Tugendhat. There is also opposition to Huawei from the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party (SNP). Top Tory: Huawei Deal Worst Govt Decision Since MI6 Hired Soviet Spy https://t.co/a5PdzchRW1 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2020  According to The Guardian, an insider said the move is the first in a “guerilla” campaign to force Downing Street to rethink its decision. In January, Prime Minister Johnson announced that he would be giving the go-ahead to allow the Chinese firm to assist developing the British 5G network, against the security advice of Five Eyes security alliance partners Australia and the United States. Assertions that Huawei would only be working on the “non-core” elements and be limited to 35 per cent of the work has not assuaged the concerns of British politicians and security specialists. Last month, Nigel Farage warned that Huawei involvement could threaten intelligence-sharing with allies, a future trade deal with the U.S., and even pose a risk to NATO. MPs discussed Huawei’s involvement in 5G during a debate in Westminster Hall on Wednesday, with Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, calling the decision to allow “effectively a state-owned corporation in the People’s Republic of China under the Communist Party” access to Britain’s 5G network “ridiculous”, comparing it to coopering with Nazis on British radar development just before the war. He said: “Imagine that in 1939 we had been developing our radar systems and decided to have one of the Nazi companies in Germany directly involved. Oh, but we reduced their involvement to 35 per cent, so they only controlled 35 per cent. I wonder how ridiculous that would have seemed.” Report: Chinese Army Stole Over 13 Million British Citizens’ Personal Data https://t.co/ImQe4loOI8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2020  The Brexiteer Tory also said the figure of 35 per cent had been “plucked from thin air” and said that restricting the Chinese firm only to the peripheries “rests on the assumption that the core cannot be compromised from the edge. Most cyber experts whom I have spoken to know that this is an unsafe assumption, because they know that the whole 5G network can be attacked starting from the compromised edge, given the nature of change to the technological capability of the edge.” “The UK Government have brushed aside the concerns of all our most important allies and the people we generally rely on. There is an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that Huawei is an untrusted vendor, which should not be given any further opportunity of access to our most vital communication networks,” he said. There have also been concerns over reports of slavery in Huawei’s supply chain. Tory MP Bob Seely has asked BT, which owns EE, to investigate whether using Huawei contravenes the telecoms company’s anti-slavery policy, after the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) study — Uyghurs For Sale — alleged that third-party suppliers to Huawei (amongst other firms named in the report) are using the forced labour of China’s Muslim minority. BT is said to be in discussions with Huawei over the report.

"Greece has accused the Turkish government of spreading “fake news” propaganda amid claims as many as five migrants have been shot dead on the border. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed that the Greek police had killed “at least five people” and that the Greek border forces had intentionally tried to pierce rubber dinghies used by migrants in an effort to sink them. “Greece persecutes those people,” Erdogan alleged in the Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah on Friday, saying: “Those [Greek] politicians should know that human life is not cheap.” “Are the borders open or closed? We don’t have time to discuss it anymore. It is done. Refugees are leaving on their own,” he added. President Erdogan also noted that he had refused an invitation from Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov to hold a trilateral summit that would include Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, saying that he rejected it because of the Greek police’s alleged treatment of migrants. “Our borders will not close. Bulgarian prime minister Borissov has asked to meet in Sofia and invite Kyriakos Mitsotakis. On the day he proposed it, there were two deaths at the border. I don’t want to be in the same place and in the same photo as him,” Erdogan claimed.

Others have also claimed that the Turkish government has not only been bussing in migrants to the border area but has been arming them with tear gas and actively helping them get across the border into Greece.

"Dramatic pictures and video are emerging of fires raging along the border between Greece and Turkey, as migrants — aided and even armed by the Turks, according to the Greeks — continue their efforts to force their way in. The European Union, including the United Kingdom, funnelled billions of euros to the Islamist government in Ankara in an effort to persuade it to bring the migrant crisis under a modicum of control after hundreds of thousands of illegal border crossings, often by sea, in 2015-16. That deal unravelled at the end of February 2020, as Turkish president Reep Tayyip Erdogan announced migrants were free to pass through his country and into Europe, seemingly as punishment for the West’s failure to offer sufficient support to his invasion of Syria, which has become fraught with danger as his forces clash with the Russian-backed Syrian government in Idlib province.   Greeks riot police clash with migrants along the Greece-Turkey border in the village of Kastanies on March 6, 2020.

Prime Minister Mitsotakis accused the Turkish government of having “systematically assisted, both at land and at sea, people in their effort to cross into Greece,” but vowed that “Europe is not going to be blackmailed over this problem by Turkey.” A migrant throws tear gas at Greek police on the Turkish-Greek border in Pazarkule, Turkey, on Friday, March 6, 2020.

(Photo by BULENT KILIC/AFP via Getty Images) Social media gives some indication of just how tense the situation on the Greek border has become, with video footage purporting to show Turkish police firing tear gas over the border at Greek police — in response to the Greeks firing tear gas at them, the Turks claim — and heavily armed soldiers from either country staring each down through border fencing as they patrol the frontier, just yards apart. The history of relations between the two countries has been far from easy, with Greeks having inhabited what is now the Turkish heartland for more than a thousand years before the Turks arrived there, and Greeks continuing to comprise a very substantial minority of Turkey’s population right up until the 1920s — when a combination of war, genocide, and population exchange all but eliminated their presence. Turkey continues to menace its much smaller neighbour down to the present day, laying claim to a number of Greek islands and violating Greek airspace and territorial waters hundreds or even thousands of times every year.

"Finland’s millennial feminist-led government faces a vote of no confidence after pledging to send personnel to the Greek border — to help migrants claim asylum. 34-year-old Green League politician Maria Ohisalo, who serves as Minister of the Interior under 34-year-old Social Democratic party leader Sanna Marin in a red-green left-wing coalition government, said Finland was following the common European Union line to “reject Turkey’s attempts to use people as political pawns” — but also said that the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications was “wrong”. The Greeks have been faced with huge pressure at their land border with Turkey, where thousands of migrants have massed, facilitated by transport provided by the Turkish authorities. The migrants have been making violent sallies against Greek border forces for days, often under cover of tear gas fire on the Greek lines by Turkish personnel — although the Turks claim this has only been in response to the Greeks firing tear gas at them. WATCH: Turkey Arms Migrants with Tear Gas, Sends Freed Prisoners to Border, Claims Greek Government https://t.co/Y7F6saZiTA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  But despite going along with the official EU-mandated line of support for the Greek government and committing to “sending a four-guard unit to take part in a rapid border intervention operation” on the Greek border, according to public broadcaster Yle, the Finnish government has also denounced the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications — and suggested any Finnish personnel on the ground will “try to support Greece” by receiving asylum seekers. “The Finnish government’s position here is clear. When we secure our borders, we are abiding by international obligations. International obligations include [observing] the right to apply for asylum. This is one of the areas where we will try to support Greece,” said Maria Ohisalo. Danish personnel operating in Greek waters with Frontex, the European Union Border and Coast Guard Agency, have already boasted of having defied orders from Greek senior officers to turn back illegal migrants arriving in Greek territorial waters by sea, instead bringing them to the Greek island of Kos. Greek Frontex leader ordered Danish Frontex patrol boat to force 33 rescued refugees/migrants back in their dingy and to tow them across the sea border. The Danish patrol boat refused to follow the order from ""Operation Poseidon"" headquarters, https://t.co/0XyNztHWMp — Ole Ryborg (@OleRyborg) March 6, 2020  The Finns Party — formerly the True Finns — is calling for a vote of no confidence in the left-wing government over its contradictory position on the border crisis, which was further complicated by finance minister Katri Kulmuni, 32. Kulumni, filling in for the prime minister — who had jetted off to New York to attend United Nations events marking International Women’s Day — stated: “We support Greece in ensuring its external borders hold. Connected to this is the fact that international law and human rights must be observed.” The Finns Party deemed that this amounted to obfuscating the government’s position, as supporting Greece’s efforts to hold its border while also insisting on its supposed obligations to receive people claiming to be asylum seekers are mutually exclusive positions. For its part, the Finnish government has insisted it will not turn away any migrants who arrive at its own border.

"A total of 76 per cent of the Greek public support the tough border control policy enacted by the conservative Greek government, according to polling. The poll, which was conducted by polling firm Pulse, found that just 18 per cent of the Greek public thought the measures currently being taken by the government to stop large numbers of migrants entering the country was wrong. The results also showed that 84 per cent of Greeks were very concerned about Turkey’s attitude toward the border situation, Greek newspaper Proto Thema reports. Respondents were also asked about their concerns regarding the spread of the coronavirus in Greece, which has around 45 confirmed cases so far. Just under half of those surveyed, 42 per cent, said they were concerned about a major outbreak occurring in Greece. The ruling New Democracy (ND) party also remain the most popular in the country, with 39 per cent of the vote in the poll, ahead of the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) headed by former Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, which scored 25 per cent. WATCH: Turkey Arms Migrants with Tear Gas, Sends Freed Prisoners to Border, Claims Greek Government https://t.co/Y7F6saZiTA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  The polls are likely to be welcome news for the Greek government which has been hit with several accusations by Turkish authorities in recent days, including allegations that border guards had fatally shot a Syrian migrant earlier in the week. Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas slammed the Turkish allegations as “fake news”, saying: “Video showing fatality on Greek-Turkish border is fake news. We call upon everyone to use caution when reporting news that furthers Turkish propaganda.” Since Turkey opened the gates to migrants last week, tensions at the land border between Greece and Turkey have been high. Migrants have attacked Greek border officials while attempting to force their way into the country. On Friday, Mr Petsas presented a video on social media that alleged the Turkish government was arming migrants with tear gas and was releasing prisoners and sending them to the border area as well.

"MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak during his Friday broadcast. Hayes said, “Consider this, how does anyone, you, me, Vice President Pence, know how to handle a situation if we don’t know the full know the scope? We have had three months to prepare for the coronavirus to come to the U.S. and see how outbreaks started. We have completely failed. The federal government have completely failed until now. We are weeks and weeks behind where we should be.” After comparing the coronavirus outbreak to Chernobyl and Hurricane Maria, Hayes played a clip of Trump being asked about a cruise ship docked off the California coast with coronavirus patients. Trump said, “I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather — because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship … I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off.” Hayes said, “He’s saying that his preference, in defiance of the experts, is that the sick Americans stay marooned on the boat because he doesn’t want the numbers going up for him… All he cares about at the numbers, not the actual problem.” He concluded, “You cannot spin a virus. Countries like China learned that early on. Spinning is all our president knows. This is what happens when you elect a BS artist to the most important job in the country.

"President Donald Trump has fortified his White House with a new chief of staff, former House Freedom Caucus chairman and retiring Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC). On Friday night, the president named Meadows his new incoming White House chief of staff, announcing that his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would become the new special envoy to Northern Ireland. I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020  ….I want to thank Acting Chief Mick Mulvaney for having served the Administration so well. He will become the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020  Meadows served as the second chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, taking the reins from the group’s founder and his close ally, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). Together, Meadows and Jordan have been a pair of the president’s fiercest defenders in the House, but even before President Trump’s 2016 election, the soft-spoken firebrand conservative from western North Carolina has helped pave the future path of the Republican Party—pulling the GOP away from swamp deals and failed establishment politics towards populist, grassroots conservative policies that are much more popular with the electorate. Meadows’ success in Congress has won him many friends among top conservatives and even across the aisle, with a huge swath of Trump allies on Friday evening telling Breitbart News that the president could not have made a better choice going into his re-election campaign. “Congressman Meadows has been one of the most effective advocates for the MAGA movement for years now,” Donald Trump, Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, told Breitbart News. “There are some major battles ahead and I can’t think of anyone more equipped to fight alongside the President for the future of our country.” “Meadows is cut from the same cloth as the President; he’s a fighter and will do what it takes to win,” Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House official and outside ally of the president, added. “He’s the perfect choice to lead the White House staff through election season. A brilliant choice by President Trump.” “Mark has great political instincts and, to put it bluntly, is just a total killer,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and also a former White House official, added. “He’s exactly who President Trump needs by his side in an election year.” “Mark being chief of staff is a massive win for the MAGA movement,” Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, told Breitbart News. “Mark Meadows is the right person at the right time to serve as President Trump’s Chief of Staff,” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News as well. “After enduring Establishment operatives undermining his efforts since his inauguration, the President will now have a fearless warrior on the inside to promote and safeguard his agenda.” Meadows was a back-bencher second-term congressman when he filed a “motion to vacate the chair” in the summer of 2015, a bold move that would have forced a vote on whether then-Speaker John Boehner would be allowed to remain in his position. When Meadows did it, most of the Washington establishment wrote him off and considered the effort unserious, but quickly and quietly he—working with his fellow House Freedom Caucus members—amassed the votes necessary by September 2015 to knock out Boehner. When Boehner realized Meadows had succeeded, he resigned before a public spectacle tanked him on the floor of the House in order to avoid embarrassment. While most of the rest of the media ignored him, Breitbart News traveled to his district that August recess to profile him and provide a detailed report on his then-quixotic effort to change Congress for the better by removing someone who, as Speaker, had pushed a variety of deals with now former President Barack Obama that left the country worse off. In the interview he gave during that trip to his district in western North Carolina, Meadows explained how so many people come to Washington, DC, and forget why they were elected in the first place—but how he wanted to be different. “I think everybody starts out doing that, because they’re real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, ‘Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,’” Meadows said when asked if enough members of Congress listen to their constituents. “The longer they’re there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I’ve had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here? There are some of them that have been difficult for me. A prime example is on the Syrian invasion, where really they were bantering back and forth on should we invade Syria or not? I had my own personal view, the fact I believed that ISIS was going to continue to grow and that we had to go in and put an end to it right away, really quickly. I was war weary, but I felt like we needed to do that. My district started calling the office and sending in surveys and other things as well—87 percent of the people that contacted us, or it could have been 82 – 82 or 87 percent of the people said, ‘We don’t want you to do that.’ We’re tired of wars. It shifted where we were to saying, “Just listen, the people back home…” and it wasn’t just Republicans. It was Democrats, independents, everyone. For us, it’s just about trying to have an open ea, then going to Washington, D.C., and voting the way the people here want you to vote. When you do that, it sometimes puts you at odds with what is deemed pragmatic in Washington, D.C., or ‘the practical thing to do,’ but I try to conduct at least a couple days of really listening every time I come back – especially if it’s for a week or longer where I’m just listening to people. Both the good and the bad. We’re going to continue to try to get better,” Meadows said. Listen to his constituents he certainly did. After he toppled Boehner—a remarkable achievement for a then-second-term congressman—Meadows soon after became the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, replacing its first chairman and founder Jim Jordan. Meadows weaponized the Freedom Caucus, leveraging the group’s approximately 40 members in the GOP majority for the last year plus of Obama’s administration and for the first two years of Trump’s first term to steer the party away from now former Speaker Paul Ryan’s failed visions for Republicans and to guide the party toward successes on major issues ranging from taxes to healthcare to immigration. Supporters of Meadows say that they should expect Trump’s new chief of staff to continue to listen to the constituents who put both of them in office—rather than special interests or lobbyists. “Finally, a chief of staff that respects the Trump supporters who put him in the White House,” J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Breitbart News. Many members of Meadows’ Freedom Caucus unit have gone on to much bigger and better things. Of course, Mulvaney is the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, a position he took after previously serving as director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Trump. But he was one of Meadows’s allies and fellow Freedom Caucus fighters back in the early days for both of them. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who’s currently America’s most popular governor, was a Freedom Caucus member when he served in the House. Former Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), now the frontrunner for U.S. Senate in Wyoming, was a Freedom Caucus member too. Another former Freedom Caucus member, former Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), now works at Liberty University leading efforts to expose Chinese communists. He told Breitbart News on Friday night that Meadows is an excellent choice for Trump to lead the White House staff. “I think Meadows loves the American people as President Trump does and that he is highly ethical and he knows who the bad apples are, and he will help to execute President Trump’s agenda and make America great again,” Brat said. When Ryan was pushing President Trump to support an unpopular and unsuccessful healthcare plan at the beginning of his first term—an Obamacare replacement that critics derisively called “RyanCare”—the deal fell apart, a Ryan failure that hurt Trump in his first few months as president. Meadows, working with Republican members like now former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), revived, reformed, strengthened, and secured House passage of the GOP healthcare plan. It was later doomed in the Senate by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who infamously gave it a thumbs-down on the floor of the Senate as he voted against it. But it would have stopped in the House after Ryan’s failure had it not been for Meadows’ work to save the president’s push for a better healthcare vision for the country than Obamacare. Healthcare was not the only major policy fight in which Meadows helped President Trump against leftist Democrats and establishment Republicans. On everything from ending endless wars to fighting against open borders amnesty pushes to battling for the Trump tax cuts and more, Meadows has been one of Trump’s go-to allies in the House since the president took office—and the two speak on the regular. Meadows was also critical in helping Trump fight back one of the most vicious and unhinged conspiracies against a sitting president in history, which ultimately ended in the president’s acquittal by the U.S. Senate after the Democrat-led House impeached him. A member of the president’s team of House members fighting back against the coup attempt by the deep state, Meadows was critical in securing the president’s position and holding back the plotters. The coup attempt started out with various leftist and media attacks claiming Russian “collusion” with Trump’s 2016 campaign that eventually led to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that cleared Trump in the en, which then led to the renewed attacks on the Ukraine front. The Ukiraine accusations led to the House impeachment effort and, finally, the president’s acquittal. Every step of the way, Meadows was at Trump’s side, fighting back against the leftists and fake news attacks that ended up failing to take Trump down. For all of these reasons and more, Meadows has lots of allies in the conservative movemen. FreedomWorks Vice President Noah Wall told Breitbart News that his group could not be happier with the choice Trump made here. “FreedomWorks could not be more proud that the former House Freedom Caucus chair and strong constitutional conservative will help support President Trump through this critical election year,” Wall said. Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, added that “Mick Mulvaney did a great job of leading the White House through impeachment and has proven to be an extraordinary utility man for the President as OMB Director and the head of the CFPB.” “He will be a trusted problem solver who is able to help Northern Ireland transition through the difficulties of Brexit,” Manning said. But Meadows, Manning added, is “a fighter who has the President’s trust.”",‘The Perfect Choice’: Trump Brings Warrior Mark Meadows into White House as Election Year Chief of Staff,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/the-perfect-choice-trump-brings-warrior-mark-meadows-into-white-house-as-election-year-chief-of-staff/,Breitbart

They have seen a 194 percent increase in .223 (AR-15 amm0) sales, 101 percent increase in 9mm ammo sales, and a 95 percent increase in the sale of 12 gauge shells. The sales of other calibers and types of ammunition have increased as well. On February 28, 2020, the Washington Examiner reported that “preppers” were buying up rifles and pistols and seeking safe havens where they could hide out should a pandemic strike. Hyatt Guns’ Justin Anderson spoke to the spike in ammunition and firearm sales, saying, “I’ve seen a notable spike in the purchase of bulk ammo, which is usually a barometer of people’s fear in these types of situations.” He added, “The person with the most ammo wins.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Democrat voters must determine if Joe Biden is “mentally fit” to serve as President of the United States given the former vice president’s frequently slurred speech and regular misstatements, assessed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas. Biden’s Super Tuesday performance — winning 566 delegates relative to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 501 delegates — is not the result of a strengthening campaign but of a division among Democrat primary voter support between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), determined Pollak. Pollak then highlighted questions of Biden’s cognition given the former vice president’s behavior: Biden doesn’t look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign. On the stage last night — I was at his victory party in Los Angeles — he, at one moment, appeared to confuse his wife and his sister. He slurred his speech. He didn’t seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign. “He did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter,” noted Pollak, referring to Biden’s failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America’s founding documents. Pollak continued: I’m being serious, here. I’m not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They’re going to do whatever it takes to be competitive. Pollak added, “Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job. When you put [Trump and Biden] side-by-side on stage, Biden comes out very poorly, and I don’t think there’s very much Democrats can do to change that.” Thomas highlighted Biden’s “cognitive function” and ability “to be sharp and quick on his feet” as noticeably lacking. Thomas asked if Sanders’ supporters would go with a possible Democrat nomination of Biden as the party’s presidential nominee. “Initially my feeling was that [Sanders supporters] would sit it out. They did not like Biden. They really didn’t like Pete Buttigieg. They  don’t like Elizabeth Warren. Early surveys suggested that the Sanders voters were the least likely to stick with the party nominee. “ What we do know is that right now the Bernie Sanders camp feels that they’re the victims of a coup,” Pollak added, noting Marianne Williamson use of the term. “They feel the Democratic establishment has maneuvered once again to try to steal the election from them, and they’re fighting that.” Pollak stated, “It’s very clear — if it wasn’t before — the Democratic establishment is pulling a lot of strings behind the scenes and really, they’re barely even trying to hide it anymore. You’re going to see a lot more shouting before all this is done.” Thomas praised Breitbart News as a “great site.” “I rely on your site regularly,” he said. “I encourage my listeners to bookmark it. You’re a thorn in the side of a left-wing media and it’s a refreshing. It’s always reliable information, much to the chagrin of what leftists say about Breitbart.

"On Friday, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf signed a disaster declaration to provide increased support to state agencies in combating the coronavirus. As the “COVID-19” pandemic — commonly known as coronavirus — continues its international tour, more and more cases are popping up despite a notable lack of widespread testing. Now, with two cases in eastern Pennsylvania’s Wayne and Delaware counties, Gov. Tom Wolf is taking measures to ensure his state is ready for the inevitable. “It is critical to prepare for and respond to suspected or confirmed cases in the commonwealth, and to implement measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Wolf said in a press conference immediately following his signing of an emergency disaster declaration. He continued: The disaster declaration is an additional way we can be prepared, so I authorized the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Director or his designee, to assume command and control of all statewide emergency operations and authorize and direct that all commonwealth departments and agencies use all available resources and personnel as is deemed necessary to cope with this emergency situation. But his reassurance was accompanied by some street-level advice to help combat the spread of the deadly contagion. “First and foremost, we want all Pennsylvanians to be safe and remain healthy and follow the practical advice of the Department of Health on ways to protect yourself from any virus,” Wolf said, “and that’s by washing hands, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough and staying home if you are sick.” Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine added her voice to the press conference as well. “As this situation evolves, we will continually update Pennsylvanians through our website, health.pa.gov, our Facebook page and our Twitter account,” she said, but she reminded citizens that “it’s important to remember that the most accurate and timely information regarding this outbreak is available through the Department of Health.” There are currently over 101,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, though the actual number of those infected may be exponentially higher. It has officially claimed at least 3,460 lives at the time of this writing. In that light, President Donald Trump has signed an emergency $8.3 billion spending bill in the interest of protecting the American people. “It’s an unforeseen problem … came out of nowhere, but we’re taking care of it,” he said.",Pennsylvania Gov.

"After three years of fighting childhood leukemia, Jonathan Whetstone rung the victory bell at Columbia hospital on Thursday. Since he was just two years old, Jonathan Whetstone has been fighting for his survival. When he contracted an ear infection and the flu before his second birthday, doctors said they had nothing to worry about. But as his parents watched their infant son’s energy decline, they pursued further testing. That diligence saved his life. Jonathan had been living with undetected childhood leukemia, which can carry a mortality rate as high as 40 percent. The fight for his life lasted for the next three years and finally ended on Thursday morning. “It’s kind of surreal after three years of going through this it’s finally over,” said Maryann Whetstone, Jonathan’s mother. Mark Whetstone, Jonathan’s father, has been overwhelmed by the widespread show of support. “It’s been prayers across the country,” he says, “Even outside the United States. The support we’ve gotten from our churches, families and volunteer firefighters service has been great.” But the local community has been just as fervent. The Edisto and Bolentown Volunteer Fire Department, where Mark volunteers, lent their support to the Whetstone family — and shared in their celebration. “What a Beautiful Day! Jonathan Whetstone has officially BEAT CANCER and rung the bell,” they posted on Facebook on Thursday morning.  But, as they wrote, “our fight still continues.” To that end, the department has signed up to participate in the “7th Annual Curing Kids Cancer Fire Truck Pull,” an event that raises money to fund research for a cure that would save the lives of other children just like Jonathan. “There are many more kids out there that need your help,” they wrote. “Help us continue celebrating Jonathan by donating to the link below. Even the smallest donation can make a HUGE difference.” At the time of this writing, they have raised $9,215 of their $10,000 goal.",South Carolina 5-Year-Old Rings Cancer-Free Bell After 3-Year Battle,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/south-carolina-5-year-old-rings-cancer-free-bell-after-3-year-battle/,Breitbart
"During a portion of an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria released on Friday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reiterated her claim that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) isn’t the strongest person to take on President Trump and stated that 2020 Democrat former Vice President Joe Biden is building “a broad-based coalition.” Clinton said, “As I’ve said many times, I do not think he’s our strongest nominee against Donald Trump.” Zakaria then asked if this was an endorsement of Biden, and Clinton responded that she isn’t endorsing. Zakaria then countered, “There’s nobody left.” Clinton conceded that there isn’t anyone left, adding, “But I think what Joe’s victories on Super Tuesday showed is that he is building the kind of coalition that I had, basically. It’s a broad-based coalition. I finished most of the work I needed to do for the nomination on Super Tuesday, and then it kind of lingered on.

"MSNBC host Al Sharpton said President Donald Trump was tearing apart the “very fabric of this country” by having Attorney General William Barr acting as his personal Roy Cohn-type lawyer. The panel was discussing a judge requesting a version of the redacted Mueller report. Host Nicolle Wallace said, “The federal judge on that issuing criticism saying that the differences between the Mueller report and the attorney general’s description of it, quote, ’cause the court to seriously question whether Barr made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the Mueller report in favor of President Trump, despite certain findings in the redacted report to the contrary. These circumstances generally and Barr’s lack of candor specifically call into question Barr’s credibility,’ a judge wrote that. One George W. Bush picked. And for that reason, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton is ordering government lawyers to give him the complete report so he can evaluate whether the material was properly blacked out.” Sharpton said, “I think what is very important about this last judge on this Mueller report, and the open rebuke of Barr is that not only is he a respected judge, he’s a Bush-appointed judge. We need to emphasize he is a Republican president’s appointed judge. And to come on as strongly as he did, he didn’t leave any room to misinterpret him. I think it is a significant statement.” He added, “It really speaks to how Barr has, in a way, helped this president reinterpret what the presidency is all about. It is a real threat to our we are going to be in this country even if Donald Trump is no longer president after the November election and trying to realign what government is.” He added, “Because if we start normalizing where the attorney general operates as the private attorney to the president, rather than the head of the Justice Department for the people. And a Roy Cohn type of lawyer at that, then we have the whole nation beginning to unravel and reinterpret what is the constitutional premise of how this government is set up. That’s what’s at stake here. This is bigger than Donald Trump and a distorted Mueller report. We’re talking about speaking to the very fabric of this country.

I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

"An illegal alien has been arrested after being on the run from law enforcement for alleged child abuse and child sex crime charges. Jose Bulmaro Cruz-Guillen, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested evading child abuse and child sex crime charges for incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2019, according to WBRC.com. The illegal alien had been twice arrested last year for crossing illegally through the United States-Mexico border. According to law enforcement officials, Cruz-Guillen was investigated in 2014 for allegedly repeatedly punching his four-year-old stepson in the face and on his body. Then, years later in 2019, Cruz-Guillen was indicted for allegedly sexually abusing his stepdaughter for years. The abuse allegedly involved first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, and sexual abuse of a child less than 12-years-old. Before his trial, Cruz-Guillen fled Etowah County, Alabama, in hopes of evading the charges. Last month, though, the Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force in Augusta, Georgia. arrested Cruz-Guillen and extradited him back to Alabama to face the charges.

Jaime Galvan, a 31-year-old illegal alien with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer, was charged with raping the 14-year-old girl after the two met up and he served her two pre-mixed alcoholic cocktails, the Idaho Press reported. The girl told police that Galvan told her to lay down after she became dizzy from the drinks. That’s when Galvan allegedly started touching the girl and raped her. Galvan was asked to stop by the girl but continued, the girl told police. The girl said the rape occurred for about five minutes. Afterward, the girl said Galvan put her pants back on her and left the room. Galvan is currently being held on a $500,000 bond.

"The number of people who have died from seasonal influenza so far has now reached 20,000, including 136 influenza-associated deaths in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported as of February 29. This is up from 18,000 just a week ago. “This number [of children] is higher for the same time period than in every season since reporting began in 2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic,” the CDC reported. As the world gears up to battle the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,460 worldwide, including 13 deaths in the United States in the state of Washington, the CDC is engaged in its usual battle to inform people about influenza and its dangers: Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications.  There are two main types of influenza (flu) virus: Types A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people (human influenza viruses) are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year. The best way to prevent flu is by getting vaccinated each year. “CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 34 million flu illnesses, 350,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths from flu,” the CDC’s Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report said. “Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to flu vaccine in the control of influenza,” the report said. Almost all (more than 99 percent) of the influenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications recommended for use in the U.S. this season.” The CDC report reveals where influenza cases exist on a state-by-state basis. The CDC said influenza reports from the U.S. Virgin Islands have been sporadic and that Guam did not report.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s (D) sanctuary city policy is responsible for freeing an illegal alien who has been accused of child sex crimes, including rape. Miguel Federico Ajqui-Ajtzalam, a 20-year-old illegal alien from Guatemala, was arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency after the New York Police Department (NYPD) freed him following his arrest for felony second-degree rape and second-degree sexual abuse of a person less than 14-years-old. According to the NYPD, Ajqui-Ajtzalam in 2018 was in a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl and had allegedly raped her five times throughout the year. The illegal alien was 19-years-old at the time. When the girl’s mother reported the man, he was subsequently charged with statutory rape. After his arrest by NYPD, though, Ajqui-Ajtzalam was arraigned and released from police custody. The NYPD ignored ICE’s request that he be turned over to them for arrest and deportation. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez defended his decision to free Ajqui-Ajtzalam: The case was reported by the girl’s mother, alleging that her daughter had a sexual relationship with an older teenager, which constituted statutory rape … Accordingly, we did not request bail for this nonviolent felony that allegedly took place a year-and-a-half ago. [Emphasis added] ICE official Thomas Decker said it is “inconceivable” that New York City officials would release an illegal alien charged with rape and sexual abuse of a child. “It’s frightening that our detainer was ignored and he was released onto New York City streets to possibly re-offend,” Decker said. “The safety of city residents, especially the more vulnerable, continues to be a priority for ICE enforcement.” Ajqui-Ajtzalam, according to ICE, first crossed illegally into the U.S. through the southern border on September 23, 2016. The illegal alien was processed as an Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC) and released into the U.S. after less than two months. He was initially encountered by U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) on Sept. 23, 2016 after illegally entering the U.S. without inspection. Ajqui-Ajtzalam was supposed to show up for his removal proceedings at a later date but never did. Now, Ajqui-Ajtzalam is in ICE custody, where he is awaiting deportation. As Breitbart News reported in January, the sanctuary state of New York released more than 7,500 criminal illegal aliens back into communities last year, including convicted murderers and sexual abusers.

"Fox News’s townhall session with President Donald Trump on March 5 averted any questions about raising wages or curbing the legal inflow of foreign workers. The 46-minute program did not mention wages or salaries, Trump’s “Blue-Collar Boom,” blue-collar H-2B visa workers, or Trump’s unfulfilled, campaign-trail promise to reform the huge white-collar H-1B program. But it did have 4.2 million viewers, making it “the most-watched town hall in cable news history,” according to Fox.  The only immigration question was focused on illegal migration — which brings in far fewer wage-cutting workers than do the various H-2A and H-1B visa worker programs, or the legal immigration of roughly one million people each year: Q Immigration. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q Next question is from Jennifer, and she has a question about this issue. THE PRESIDENT: Hi. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Thank you, Mr. President. This is truly an honor and one of the best days of my life. Just don’t tell my husband. (Laughs.) THE PRESIDENT: Wow. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: And I want to know: How are you going to control the illegal immigration without support from the Democratic Party? THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know it’s been hard, but we’ve done it incredibly. It could have been — we have things called “loopholes,” and the loopholes are terrible, like lottery — where you give lotteries. They pick lotteries and they have people coming into our country …. The soft-ball question allowed Trump to talk about his growing progress in building the border wall: And, most importantly, the wall is way under construction. We’re up to 129 miles already. Where we have a wall, by the way, nobody is coming through — practically nobody. We will have, by early next year, almost 500 miles of wall. And once we have that wall, it’s going to stop drugs, it’s going to stop big percentages of everything coming in. Okay? (Applause.) And we’re really — really doing job. Trump’s tough policies have dramatically reduced blue-collar migration over the Mexican border, amid furious resistance from various pro-migration groups in business, law, and Congress. In February, for example, officials slashed the catch and release of migrants to just 2,000 migrants, greatly easing the task of sending them home once their legal stay is up. In May 20189, 80,000 migrants were released because of the mass migration to the border. Trump’s lower-migration, “Hire American” policies have helped to spike wages for blue-collar Americans. But Trump has zig-zagged while business donors push him to increase the legal inflow of white-collar workers via the H-1B and Optional Practical Training programs.

"Scott Presler told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump’s tweets about the trash-filled and rat-infested streets in Baltimore inspired him to help clean up the city and, since then, many other American cities, including San Francisco, where Presler said he was shocked by the conditions on that city’s streets. ….As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019  Trump’s tweets about Baltimore angered the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who represented the city, but Presler reacted differently. “Everybody was pointing the finger but nobody was doing anything,” said Pressler, who is a loyal Trump supporter. “I said, okay, I’m going to send out a tweet saying I’m going to the city of Baltimore even if it’s me standing on a street corner picking up trash,” Presler said. “From that we had more than 170 volunteers descending on the city of Baltimore and we picked up 12 tons of trash in 12 hours in one day,” Pressler said. Breitbart News spoke with Presler at the recent American Conservative Union’s 2020 CPAC convention in Oxon Hill, Maryland, about why he started a movement that has made fans and volunteers of the almost half a million people who follow him on Twitter. Since his first cleanup in Baltimore in August of 2019, Presler and his volunteers and fellow Trump supporters collected 105 tons of trash in Austin, Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles before the New Year arrived. This year, so far, he has also cleaned up in Portland, Oregon, but it was his trip to San Francisco that put a new spotlight on the blight in one of America’s once shining cities. “You saw some horrible things in San Francisco,” Breitbart News asked Pressler. “Can you share what you saw, because it wasn’t just coke bottles and water bottles.” “I can just tell you I have been to some of America’s most dirtiest and dangerous cities — I’ve been to Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco — San Francisco was the only city where you had to watch your step because of human excrement,” Presler said. “You know you hear things about the ‘poop map,’ and you hear things about the city — it’s hard to believe because so many things are hyperbole,” Pressler said. “I’m here to tell you having walked the streets it’s real, it’s factual.” He witnessed people passed out on sidewalks surrounded by trash and used needle syringes. “It was really sad,” Presler said. Presler plans more cleanups on March 14 in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia on April 4. His crew will visit Detroit on May 2 and he also hopes to host a cleanup during the Democrat nominating conference in July. “Sometimes, before pointing the finger at someone else, you have to point it back at yourself and ask, ‘What are YOU doing to help?’” Pressler told Breitbart News.  “I’m not going to wait for the government to fix the problem,” Presler said. “I’m going to do it myself and vote out those who aren’t helping our cities.” And now, Presler has added another date for cleaning up: This Sunday in Nashville, Tennessee. “As soon as I heard about the tornadoes in Nashville, I felt a responsibility to help,” Presler said. “What do all of these followers, likes, and retweets on Twitter mean if I don’t use my platform for good?” Things are coming together. We’ve identified some neighborhoods to help in Nashville. We’re going to literally go door-to-door, asking people what debris they want removed  & if they need anything else.  I’ll have a list of items that volunteers can donate for the cleanup. — #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) March 5, 2020  Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",Scott Presler’s Trump-Inspired City Cleanup Movement Finds Horror on the Streets of San Francisco,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/scott-preslers-trump-inspired-city-cleanup-movement-finds-horror-on-the-streets-of-san-francisco/,Breitbart
"The FBI missed opportunities to stop homegrown jihadis from killing and injuring Americans between November 2009 and January 2017,under the Obama administration and the leadership of the agency’s former director James Comey, an audit released this week by the inspector general (IG) at the Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed. On Wednesday, Michael Horowitz, the DOJ IG who serves as the department’s internal government watchdog, reported: The FBI has acknowledged that various weaknesses related to its assessment process may have impacted its ability to fully investigate certain counterterrorism assessment subjects who later committed terrorist attacks in the United States. Following these attacks, the FBI made various efforts to evaluate and improve its assessment process. However, it has not ensured that identified areas for improvement were formalized and implemented into enhanced policies and procedures. … During our audit, we found at least six attacks committed in the United States by individuals who the FBI had previously assessed or investigated and who were subsequently categorized as HVEs [homegrown violent extremists]. The FBI reportedly defines “HVEs as global jihad-inspired individuals who are in the United States, have been radicalized primarily in the United States, and are not receiving individualized direction from a foreign terrorist organization (FTO).” Horowitz identified the six attacks by individuals who were under the FBI’s radar as: The cited terrorists killed a total of 70 people and injured scores of others. Horowitz highlighted the “lapses” in how the FBI handled some of the cases, noting: Following the 2009 attack at a military facility in Fort Hood, Texas, the FBI requested an independent review of its actions associated with its assessment of Nidal Hasan, the individual who conducted the attack. This review determined that shortcomings in the FBI’s policies and procedures related to counterterrorism assessments contributed to delays and potential missed opportunities to mitigate Hasan’s actions. … Similar lapses in acting on subsequent threat information regarding a previous FBI subject were also noted … following a terrorist attack in Garland, Texas. … Threat information related to Elton Simpson was conveyed … but not acted upon because field office agents did not interpret the information as portraying a significant threat, which resulted in a missed opportunity to avert the attack. … Although the field office subsequently received additional information regarding Simpson and opened an investigation on him, the field office did not open an assessment on Simpson’s roommate, who also had indications of radical behavior and participated in the Garland terrorist attack. The audit also found shortcomings in how the FBI handled the 2013 Boston Marathon attack. Horowitz reported: In April 2014, a multi-agency Inspector General review of the FBI’s actions in assessing Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the HVEs who carried out the terrorist attack, found that the FBI counterterrorism agent assigned to the [case] … did not take certain available steps to evaluate the subject. Although the DOJ [IG] could not definitively determine if these steps would have revealed any additional information, the DOJ [IG] concluded that certain available investigative steps, including conducting additional database searches, asking questions of Tsarnaev and his parents to elicit information about any plans Tsarnaev may have had to travel to Russia, and interviewing Tsarnaev’s former girlfriend and wife, would have resulted in a more thorough assessment [of the threat]. Horowitz suggested that FBI agents were too quick to close some terrorism cases, which resulted in a failure to assess the potential threat adequately. He wrote: Since September 11, 2001, HVEs have carried out over 20 attacks in the United States, some of which occurred after the FBI closed a counterterrorism investigation or assessment on the individual. Following these attacks, the FBI conducted reviews and determined there were weaknesses in its HVE assessment processes. However, we found that the FBI has not taken sufficient action to address these weaknesses. Additionally, in 2017, the FBI conducted an enterprise-wide review and identified potential terrorist threats that may not have been adequately assessed during calendar years (CY) 2014 through 2016, which amounted to 6 percent of the total assessments reviewed. We found that the FBI did not take adequate action on nearly 40 percent of these assessments for 18 months. After we inquired about the lack of action, the FBI reexamined these assessments and, in some instances, the reexamination resulted in the opening of an investigation. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) acknowledged via Twitter on Thursday that many of the missed opportunities occurred under the leadership of Comey, who served as FBI director between July 2013 and May 2017. When I asked James comey after the Pulse mass shooting if in retrospect the FBI concluded too soon that Mateen was not a threat.

"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday announced its updated debate guidelines, which essentially eliminate the chance of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) participating in the upcoming CNN/Univision debate. In order to participate in the March 15 debate, a candidate must have earned at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates allotted up to that point. That effectively eliminates the chance of Gabbard, who remains in the race, participating, as she currently stands with two delegates. The previous debate requirement allowed a candidate to participate if he or she had a single pledged delegate. If the DNC stuck to the previous rules, Gabbard, who did not qualify for any of the debates ahead of the caucuses in Iowa and Nevada or the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, would have been able to participate. Joe Biden (D), as of Friday, held the lion’s share of delegates — 664. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) easily surpasses the 20 percent threshold as well, with 573 delegates. According to Politico, “Biden had earned 48 percent of delegates awarded thus far, while Sanders had 41 percent. (Some delegates have not yet been awarded from states that held primaries this week on Super Tuesday.) DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa signaled this week that a change in requirements was imminent. “We have two more debates– of course the threshold will go up,” Hinojosa said on Tuesday. “By the time we have the March debate, almost 2,000 delegates will be allocated. The threshold will reflect where we are in the race, as it always has,” she added: We have two more debates– of course the threshold will go up.

On Tuesday, she highlighted a Fox News segement featuring Karl Rove, who suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has since dropped out of the race, was the only woman left in the Democrat primary. “.@DanaPerino I’m not quite sure why you’re telling FOX viewers that Elizabeth Warren is the last female candidate in the Dem primary,” Gabbard said. “Is it because you believe a fake indigenous woman of color is ‘real’ and the real indigenous woman of color in this race is fake?”: .@DanaPerino I'm not quite sure why you're telling FOX viewers that Elizabeth Warren is the last female candidate in the Dem primary.

"Landmark Legal Foundation, the conservative public interest law firm chaired by radio host and author Mark Levin, filed an ethics complaint Friday against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for his recent threatening statement against Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. At a demonstration Wednesday with pro-choice advocates outside the Supreme Court, as it heard a challenge to a Louisiana law requiring doctors performing abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, Schumer had singled out Gorsuch and Kavanaugh specifically, saying: “[Y]ou have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you, if you go forward with these awful decisions.” Schumer’s statement earned a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but he refused to apologize. The Landmark Legal Foundation complaint, filed with the Senate Ethics Committee, states, in part, that Schumer’s statement may “inflame the unhinged and incite violence”; that they “may violate criminal provisions of federal law”; and that the Senate should consider censure as a remedy. It notes that the Senate could also choose to reprimand or even expel Schumer for his comments. Currently, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has introduced a resolution to censure Schumer, though it may not have enough support to pass a filibuster threshold of 60 votes. Joel B.

"Four GOP-held Senate seats are currently being led by Democrats, with at least a four-point margin, according to new polls from Public Policy Polling (PPP). The polling found Sara Gideon with a four-point lead over incumbent Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) at 47-43 in the Maine Senate race and Mark Kelly leading Sen. Martha McSally (R-AR) 47-42 in the Arizona Senate race. In the poll conducted in Maine, Collins’ approval rating sits at 33 percent, with 57 percent of voters expressing disapproval of her job performance. In the Arizona poll, PPP found McSally to have a 37 percent job approval rating while 46 percent stated they disapprove of her performance in office. Kelly, who is running to unseat McSally, received a greater favorability rating of 41 percent, while 29 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. The poll also found a correlation between President Donald Trump’s approval rating in Arizona and Maine with that of McSally and Collins. The poll noted, “In Maine only 42 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing to 56 percent who disapprove, and in Arizona only 45 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing to 51 percent who disapprove.” In addition to the results found in Maine and Arizona, Public Policy Polling also found Cal Cunningham with a lead over incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) at 46-41 in the North Carolina Senate race and John Hickenlooper with a lead over Cory Gardner (R-CO) at 51-38 in the Colorado Senate race. Should the Democrats successfully take these four GOP seats currently held by Collins, McSally, Tillis, and Gardner, and lose in Alabama where Sen. Doug Jones’ (D-AL) seat is at stake—assuming nothing else changes – the Vice President next year would cast the tie-breaking vote to decide the majority.

"Hilary Rosen, the Democrat strategist who once attacked Ann Romney for being a stay-at-home mom, apologized Friday to Nina Turner, spokesperson for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), for a racially-charged shouting match on CNN. But for the Sanders campaign, it was not enough. The two had argued Thursday evening on Chris Cuomo’s Prime Time over the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., after Turner suggested that former Vice President Joe Biden was the “white moderate” that King had warned about in his famous “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” Rosen countered that Turner was not qualified to invoke the civil rights leader against Biden. “You don’t have that standing. I’m sorry, you don’t.” Turner resounded angrily: “Don’t tell me what kind of standing I have as a black woman in America. … How dare you, as a white woman.” As the Daily Caller noted, Rosen apologized — but deleted the tweet because it referred to “angry black women,” which some readers found offensive. Sanders demanded an apology directly from Biden on Friday afternoon: .@JoeBiden must accept responsibility for his surrogate telling our campaign co-chair Senator @NinaTurner that she doesn't have standing to invoke the words of Dr. King. That is unacceptable and Joe must apologize to Nina and all the people of color supporting our campaign. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 6, 2020  In 2012, Rosen apologized to Ann Romney, wife of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, for mocking her by saying she had “never worked a day in her life.” Joel B.

"Police are searching for a group of suspects who allegedly stomped on a teenage girl lying on a sidewalk in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday. Surveillance footage showed the group of suspects surround a 15-year-old girl on Utica Avenue in Crown Heights and repeatedly attack her as she lay on the pavement, according to CBS New York. At the beginning of the video, one suspect ran toward the girl and stomped on her as she curled up in the fetal position and tried to protect herself. Seconds later, several other suspects approached and kicked her repeatedly. As the crowd began to disperse, a man wearing jeans and a green shirt bent down and pulled off her shoes, then walked away from the scene. The suspects also reportedly stole the young woman’s cell phone and debit card. “The victim was taken to the hospital with bruising and swelling to her face,” the report said. Friday morning, the New York Police Department (NYPD) tweeted the video and asked residents for help in identifying the suspects: 🚨WANTED for ROBBERY/GANG ASSAULT: On 3/5, at approx 4:10 PM, in front of 216 Utica Ave in Brooklyn, a 15-year-old female was approached by a group of individuals & was punched & kicked to the ground & had her property removed.

In February, New York City residents told Mayor Bill de Blasio during a town hall event that they are fed up with the growing crime rate and asked him to work with state lawmakers to abolish the new bail reform law, Breitbart News reported. “Many people are being beaten, slashed, and hurt by criminals being released. They said they would only release people that are non-violent but they’re releasing people who are very, very violent,” one resident said. “New York City is becoming a crime city. Could you please get rid of bail reform to make our city safer?” she asked him. Despite their concerns, de Blasio claimed people who believe the crime rate is increasing were “not interested in the facts” and accused them of “whipping up fear.” However, the NYPD said Thursday that the state’s bail reform law was mostly to blame for the recent spike in crime, according to the New York Post.  “Criminal justice reforms serve as a significant reason New York City has seen this uptick in crime,” the department stated.","VIDEO: Suspects Stomp, Kick Teenage Girl on Brooklyn Sidewalk",2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/03/06/video-suspects-stomp-kick-teenage-girl-on-brooklyn-sidewalk/,Breitbart
"The left-wing Hollywood celebrities are stoking public hysteria over the coronavirus, using social media to spread fear as well as disinformation about President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly global outbreak. While some stars are using the coronavirus to re-air their hatred of all things Trump, many other celebrities are fanning the flames by making false claims about President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, accusing the White House of lying to the American public and exacerbating the problem. Comedian Chelsea Handler repeated the false claim that President Trump suggested that people who have “tested positive for coronavirus can still go to work and get better there.” Trump supporters: your president just suggested people who have tested positive for the Coronavirus can still go to work and get better there. Go with god. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 5, 2020  But President Trump never said or suggested what Handler claims he did. The president was speaking during an interview this week on Fox News’ Hannity in which he described some situations in which people who have contracted coronavirus only experience a mild case of the illness and quickly recover. President Trump said that some of these people chose to go to work and eventually got better, but he never recommended that they do so. “So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better,” Trump said. I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC.

But Fauci has denied the claim, saying during a recent White House briefing: “Let me clarify. I have never been muzzled — ever.” He said that the rumor arose out of a misunderstanding. “We were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, ‘Let’s regroup and figure out how we’re going to be communicating.’ So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared.” But Tony Fauci – head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH for 36 yrs now (!) – needs Mike Pence's approval to speak publicly.

"A court in a German city has ruled that the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD) will be allowed to erect a statue of Vladimir Lenin, the mass-murdering founder of the Soviet Union. The administrative court in Gelsenkirchen overruled the city’s decision to halt the construction of a monument to Vladimir Lenin, the architect of the Russian Revolution of 1917 which birthed the Soviet Union — a state responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of innocent people. The city had argued that the statue would detract from the historical value of the adjacent savings bank building, but the court ruled that objections over Lenin’s historical atrocities were irrelevant as the statue is to be constructed more than ten meters away from the bank, Deutsche Welle reports. The Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany hailed the decision by the court, saying: “A few weeks before his 150th birthday, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin has once again won a great victory.” The move by the court was slammed by Marco Buschmann, a Free Democrats (FDP) member of parliament from Gelsenkirchen, who said: “A Lenin statue would be a disgrace for Gelsenkirchen” as “Lenin stands for mass murder and totalitarianism.” “Anyone who wants to erect a Lenin statue should ask themselves whether they are still grounded in liberal democratic principles or not,” he added.

The statue was first installed in the city in the early 1990s after a local man purchased the statue following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Benedict Evans, a local venture capitalist, and over 900 people in a Facebook group named “Seattle, Tear Down This Lenin Statue!” called for the removal of the monument to the communist dictator. “If one wanted to pull down statues of profoundly evil people, responsible for uncountable human suffering, this one might be on the list,” Evans wrote. Lenin’s reign as the head of the Soviet Union was marked by mass starvation, the internment of political enemies in gulags (concentration camps), the mass executions of the Red Terror, and the invasion of neighbouring countries. In his persecution of the kulaks — peasants with over eight acres of land — Lenin ordered his men in one instance to: “1) hang without fail, so that the public sees, at least 100 notorious kulaks, the rich, and the bloodsuckers. 2) Publish their names. 3) Take away all of their grain. 4) Execute the hostages.” “This needs to be accomplished in such a way, that people for hundreds of miles around will see, tremble, know and scream out: let’s choke and strangle those blood-sucking kulaks,” Lenin commanded.

A majority, 53%, said that Sanders was their second choice, followed by 32% who said Biden was their second choice, 5% who chose Gabbard, and 10% who were undecided as to who their second choice candidate will be. Despite Biden’s edge, the greatest proportion of likely Democrat voters, 43 percent, are supportive of Medicare for All — a hallmark of Sanders’ campaign. “When asked which candidate had the best healthcare policy, Sanders lead with 43% and Biden followed at 40%,” Emerson reported.

"Swedish populist leader Jimmie Åkesson has been reported to the police for inciting “hate” after handing out “Sweden is full” flyers in Turkey this week. Swedish attorney Behrang Eslami reported the Sweden Democrat (SD) leader to the police, claiming that Åkesson was engaging in incitement against a group of people by handing out the flyers near Turkey’s border with Greece. “I believe that it is everyone’s right to seek asylum in Europe or in Sweden,” Elsami told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. “To go down and try to persuade people, who are fleeing for their lives and in need, not to go to Europe. It is in principle wrong and it violates human rights,” he claimed. Åkesson responded to the police report, telling broadcaster TV4, in comments reported by Nyheter Idag, that he considered himself a voice for many Swedes, pointing to recent opinion polls that have shown his party as the most popular in the country. Swedish Populist Leader Hands Out ‘Sweden Is Full’ Flyers in Turkey https://t.co/kYSdYhi75L — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2020  “I think it is pretty clear when you look at opinion polls and other things that the Swedish people want a more restrictive immigration policy than the one we have had so far,” he said. Lawyer Anton Strand, who was hired by Åkesson, also dismissed the police complaint, telling Nyheter Idag: “It seems to me that people have sought attention rather than wanted to make a serious complaint.” “Notifying a person without basis can in itself constitute a criminal act and my client is also considering reporting the lawyer to the Law Society,” he added. Åkesson’s handing out of the flyers, which stated, “Sweden is full. Don’t come to us! We can’t give you more money or provide housing. Sorry about this message,” is not the first time a country or politicians have tried to dissuade migrants from coming to Europe. In 2018, Belgium launched a social media campaign directed at migrants, stating that many of the promises made by people-traffickers about Europe were actually myths.

"Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) stumped for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at a rally in Detroit, Michigan, on Friday, encouraging supporters to mobilize their friends and family and declaring that it would “feel good to have a president that you didn’t have to check” all the time. Tlaib stumped for the presidential hopeful on Friday in her home state ahead of its upcoming March 10 primary. “This is a once in a lifetime moment in our country to elect someone who won’t sell us out,” she said to cheers. “It would feel good to have a president that you didn’t have to check him all the time,” she continued, instructing the energized crowd to mobilize their friends and family members: 2020 is about showing up for others folks. It really is, because when you cast that vote, please know that vote isn’t just for you. It’s for the kids— kids caged at the border. It’s for that mother that doesn’t know how she can afford insulin for her daughter, for her children. “It’s for all of the people now living in poverty. It’s for my neighbors right here in Detroit that get their water shut off, their kids taken away the following day. Show up for her,” she continued. Tlaib praised Sanders for taking on the “wealthy” and “powerful” and predicted that he will win Michigan. “He’s winning states all over the country, and he’s about to win Michigan,” she said, promising that “another world is possible.” Sanders, for his part, delivered a typical stump speech, calling President Trump a “pathological liar,” “bully,” and “vindictive person.” He also accused him of running a “corrupt administration”:  Michigan, offering 125 delegates, is one of six states voting Tuesday.",Rashida Tlaib: ‘It Would Feel Good to Have a President that You Didn’t Have to Check’ All the Time,2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/rashida-tlaib-feel-good-have-president-didnt-have-check-all-time/,Breitbart
"MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak during his Friday broadcast. Hayes said, “Consider this: how does anyone–you, me, Vice President Pence–know how to handle a situation if we don’t know the full scope? We have had three months to prepare for the coronavirus to come to the U.S. and see how outbreaks started. We have completely failed. The federal government have completely failed until now. We are weeks and weeks behind where we should be.” After comparing the coronavirus outbreak to Chernobyl and Hurricane Maria, Hayes played a clip of Trump being asked about a cruise ship docked off the California coast with coronavirus patients. Trump said, “I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather — because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship … I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off.” Hayes said, “He’s saying that his preference, in defiance of the experts, is that the sick Americans stay marooned on the boat because he doesn’t want the numbers going up for him… All he cares about at the numbers, not the actual problem.” He concluded, “You cannot spin a virus. Countries like China learned that early on. Spinning is all our president knows. This is what happens when you elect a BS artist to the most important job in the country. He has BSed his way through his entire career. He has BSed his way through a crisis, and he is trying to BS his way through this one so here we are.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",MSNBC’s Hayes: ‘BS Artist’ Trump Coronavirus Response ‘Completely Failed’,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/06/msnbcs-hayes-bs-artist-trump-coronavirus-response-completely-failed/,Breitbart
"Democrat voters must determine if Joe Biden is “mentally fit” to serve as President of the United States given the former vice president’s frequently slurred speech and regular misstatements, assessed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas. Biden’s Super Tuesday performance — winning 566 delegates relative to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 501 delegates — is not the result of a strengthening campaign but of a division among Democrat primary voter support between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), determined Pollak. Pollak then highlighted questions of Biden’s cognition given the former vice president’s behavior: Biden doesn’t look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign. On the stage last night — I was at his victory party in Los Angeles — he, at one moment, appeared to confuse his wife and his sister. He slurred his speech. He didn’t seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign. “He did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter,” noted Pollak, referring to Biden’s failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America’s founding documents. Pollak continued: I’m being serious, here. I’m not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They’re going to do whatever it takes to be competitive. Pollak added, “Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job. When you put [Trump and Biden] side-by-side on stage, Biden comes out very poorly, and I don’t think there’s very much Democrats can do to change that.” Thomas highlighted Biden’s “cognitive function” and ability “to be sharp and quick on his feet” as noticeably lacking. Thomas asked if Sanders’ supporters would go with a possible Democrat nomination of Biden as the party’s presidential nominee. “Initially my feeling was that [Sanders supporters] would sit it out. They did not like Biden. They really didn’t like Pete Buttigieg. They  don’t like Elizabeth Warren. Early surveys suggested that the Sanders voters were the least likely to stick with the party nominee. “ What we do know is that right now the Bernie Sanders camp feels that they’re the victims of a coup,” Pollak added, noting Marianne Williamson use of the term. “They feel the Democratic establishment has maneuvered once again to try to steal the election from them, and they’re fighting that.” Pollak stated, “It’s very clear — if it wasn’t before — the Democratic establishment is pulling a lot of strings behind the scenes and really, they’re barely even trying to hide it anymore. You’re going to see a lot more shouting before all this is done.” Thomas praised Breitbart News as a “great site.” “I rely on your site regularly,” he said. “I encourage my listeners to bookmark it. You’re a thorn in the side of a left-wing media and it’s refreshing. It’s always reliable information, much to the chagrin of what leftists say about Breitbart. It’s very accurate information, and I’m pleased you’re there.” The Brian Thomas Show, which broadcasts live on AM station 55KRC in Cincinnati from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern, is available any time nationwide via iHeartRADIO.

"Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ripped into his former political party, the Democrats, and laid out why he considers himself now a “Trumpocrat” in a broad, nearly 30-minute-long exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Saturday morning. Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Blagojevich—whose sentence President Donald Trump commuted last month, releasing him from federal prison—laid out how his old political party has “abandoned” American workers and black voters. Blagojevich said a number of policies his former party’s leaders, from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to former Vice President Joe Biden to even his home-state Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), have put forward have hurt African Americans and working class Americans economically and socially—and now that he is out of prison, and clear of the Democrat Party machine, he is speaking out against it all. What’s more, Blagojevich says the great irony of American politics is that Trump—a Republican—has done more to rectify these problems that Democrats created for black and working class Americans than any of America’s other recent presidents, in large part because Trump has ditched the “traditional” GOP playbook to pursue a more solutions-oriented agenda. Upon his release from prison, Blagojevich announced he is a “Trumpocrat”–making him the highest profile such Democrat who has left the Democratic Party to join President Trump–and here he explains his views in the most in-depth interview yet since his release. “When I say I’m a Trumpocrat—and hopefully a lot of others are as well, and I believe they are—it’s largely because the Democratic Party has not only left us but it’s abandoned traditional Democratic constituencies like working people, factory workers like my father an immigrant who came to America and spent all of his time here as a working man working in a steel factory,” Blagojevich said. “And also, the Democratic Party has for far too long taken the African American community for granted. They’ve not only abandoned them, they’ve sold them out when they passed the crime bill in 1994 that President Clinton and Vice President Biden, then-Senator Biden backed and voted for. Our senator here, Sen. Durbin, voted for it. It’s a bill that led to the mass incarceration of a whole new generation of African American men for nonviolent first-time drug offenses, over-sentencing them and then putting them in a position where they can have no opportunity whatsoever to begin a new life after correcting the mistakes that they made and paying their debts to society, frankly, for the crimes that they committed. President Trump, interestingly enough, is speaking to those constituencies in ways that traditional Republicans never did.” Blagojevich said that whether it’s through his economic policies or his criminal justice reform policies or other norm-challenging fights, Trump has upended the normal political battle lines in a way that is “revolutionizing American politics” and “re-aligning” what would be considered “traditional” political coalitions by zoning in on and successfully “drawing from” what were considered “Democratic constituency groups.” “And I think he’s not only been successful politically because he’s done it, I think he’s revolutionizing American politics,” Blagojevich said. “He’s re-aligning politics in America by drawing from those traditional Democratic constituency groups, the factory worker that used to work in a factory that’s gone because of the 1994 NAFTA bill that President Clinton signed sending all those jobs away. President Trump is bringing them back in places like western Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin and southern Illinois—the rust belt states. One of the many frustrations I had as governor was when I would leave the Chicagoland area where I’m from—I’m from Chicago—and I’d visit places like the Quad Cities or Marion, Illinois, or Franklin County, Illinois, where they used to have coal mines and people were working and that was the economic anchor of the community or you’d go to a place like Galesburg, Illinois, where the Maytag factory once was but has left because of NAFTA and President Clinton and the policies of the Democratic Party that’s supposed to be the party that protected those people and looked out for their interests. It’s hard to be able to explain to those communities that there was hope, that there was a possibility that we might be able to bring some of those economic engines back to the state. Now, at last, we have a president who not only promised to do it but he’s doing it. I think President Trump is making real strides in succeeding in that but more importantly he’s actually addressing the needs of the American worker. And with the First Step Act, he’s actually done something for a community that overwhelming votes for Democrats like me. We easily get 90 percent or better of the African American vote when we run against Republicans. Yet, the Democratic Party I would say cynically has taken the African American community for granted. It’s almost immoral, their treatment of the African American community by sort of just keeping them dependent and in a certain place where they have to look to government for all the answers when at the same it’s actually government through over-sentencing and targeting African Americans that are causing a lot of the problems and conditions in these very communities.” Blagojevich served almost eight years of a 14-year sentence handed down after multiple trials finally resulted in partial convictions, some of which were later vacated on appeal. The first time they came at Blagojevich, he was convicted on only one of 24 charges—the charge was lying to the FBI, something the agency has similarly used to target Trump allies in the various scandals he’s been entangled in—but then prosecutors retried him on 20 counts and he was convicted on 17 of them, acquitted on one, and on the other two no verdict was rendered. Later, on appeal, five of the counts were vacated and Blagojevich’s lawyers continued fighting for years to try to get the Supreme Court to hear them. But eventually, it was Trump in early 2020 who commuted his sentence—and let him out after eight years behind bars. Blagojevich to this day insists he did nothing wrong, and that what he was put away for was politics as usual. In fact the core allegation that he tried to sell Obama’s U.S. Senate seat when Obama was president-elect and Blagojevich was to appoint Obama’s successor, was one of the conviction charges vacated—or overturned—on appeal. But the broader point Blagojevich tells with this story is that there is a serious problem in America’s criminal justice system, and what happened to him could happen to anyone. “On this subject, sadly and unfortunately it took this long—I had this experience I had to endure and I will tell your listeners they put me in prison for things that are routine politics. I didn’t cross any lines,” Blagojevich said. “We were doing routine political things. The sale of the Senate seat was never a crime. That was reversed by the appellate court. I was there for some fundraising requests and they convicted me by moving the line and telling the jury you can be convicted for seeking a campaign contribution without any evidence of a promise or a threat because there was none. But anyway, having said all of that, this long unhappy experience has given me a unique perspective. I truly believe I am an expert witness on this. I have street cred having done eight years in prison and I spent the first 32 months in prison as probably the only governor in American history to be in a high security prison behind what the inmates call ‘the razor wire,’ where I spent nearly three years with over 900 inmates coming and going where some would leave and new ones would come in. They were largely drug dealers, gang-bangers, cartel members, there were bank robbers here, there men there who had committed murder, only two percent were so-called ‘white collar.’ So, I really got a firsthand lesson on real life and yes of course I met a lot of my fellow inmates—particularly drug dealers—who experienced over sentencing. Here’s a classic example, Jonair Moore, my friend who I just left behind is in his 11th year or actually just starting his 12th year of prison as part of a 26-year sentence as a first-time non-violent drug offender, a young African American man. Consider the fact that the average rapist in America serves no more than four years, and here’s Jonair—he’s not unusual, he’s actually the rule not the exception, sent to prison for a quarter of a century for a one-time mistake when no one was hurt. The system is broken and it disproportionately discriminates against African Americans. It’s what the author Michelle Alexander has called ‘The New Jim Crow in America.’” Trump, Blagojevich said, has done more to reform this broken system than any Democrat has—including the first black president, Obama—and he said it was Democrats who created the problem to begin with when Biden and Clinton and Durbin teamed up to push the 1994 crime bill that Obama did nothing to alleviate. “I’ll say this, this is one of the great ironies in modern history: On this issue, it’s actually Donald Trump who’s trumping the first African American president—Obama—and actually doing something to solve this problem and undo the racist injustice caused by that 1994 crime bill, which has led to the current conditions we’re facing,” Blagojevich said. “This was a bill Joe Biden not only voted for, but Joe Biden was a vocal advocate for and so were most of the leading Democrats including my senator here in Illinois Dick Durbin and of course President Clinton was the who signed it.” Asked if these actions by Trump on this front, and what Trump has done with the economy and school choice among other efforts are winning the president support in the black community, Blagojevich said that “my instincts tell me that it will and it will be a dramatic improvement among President Trump’s performance in the African American community among voters.” Democrats have usually won around 90 percent or more of the black vote in most elections. Trump won about eight percent in 2016, which, while better than failed 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s six percent that year, is still a very small percentage. “I’ve only been home a little over two weeks so I haven’t been as plugged into the community as I was in the good old days, but I have made an appearance on an African American radio station here in Chicago maybe the second or third day I was home and I got the sense there was a growing sense President Trump was someone who was actually addressing the problems in the African American community that they have gotten all too often almost accepting that they’re going to receive from the politicians they elected is just lip service,” Blagojevich said. “I think there’s a real sense among people, and it’s growing as the truth gets out, and I think there’s going to be more and more people in the African American community who see that this president, President Trump, is a very different kind of leader than a traditional politician. This is a guy who solves problems as opposed to making honestly—very too often, politicians make promises they have no intention of following through on to begin with. I think that when it comes to criminal justice reform, this is a case where this is a president who’s actually doing real meaningful things that’s leading to the end of over-sentencing of many African Americans in the system. I saw a few guys go home before I went home because of the First Step Act. In terms of the guys I went to prison with, are they seeing what President Trump is doing? The answer is: yes, they are. And I also think a lot of these guys like the fact that this is a president with a badass style and a guy that actually fights. I think they like that too, and that’s waking up a lot of people. They’re sick and tired of the BS.” Blagojevich, who was the home state governor of Obama’s Illinois in 2008, when the former president was first elected to the White House, and was the first governor in America to endorse him that year, also told Breitbart News he now considers it a mistake to have endorsed Obama. Blagojevich said that Obama promised all sorts of changes and hope for the country—“hope and change” were the now former president’s infamous campaign slogan—but Blagojevich says now upon reflection that Obama failed in every respect to bring either to the country, and that they were empty rhetorical catchphrases with no substance behind them. He said Trump, on the other hand, has actually delivered whereObama failed. “President Obama was elected in 2008. Here’s something I’ll plead guilty to: I was the first governor to endorse him,” Blagojevich said. “That I did, and it was wrong—but at the time I thought it was right. Obama’s election if you really think about it was based very little on detail. It was based on his themes ‘hope and change.’ People were sick and tired of the usual baloney in politics and fake solutions dressed up as solutions but they’re not real. ‘These guys are saying they did something for us somehow, but I’m not feeling it. Things continued to stay the same and the lobbyists and the insiders are all getting rich in Washington or in my case in Illinois in Springfield, but how come my tax bill is going up?’ Obama was elected because the American people felt they wanted change and this was a new candidate who was talking about hope and change. It wasn’t a lot of substance under it, but they were so hungry for change they took a leap of faith on President Obama and did something historic electing our first African American president in the history of our country—which is a very good thing for our country. It turns out however Obama was just that, all rhetoric. It was just a slogan. He didn’t do it. So I think that eight years later, when President Trump came down that escalator—I was watching that in prison on one of those televisions in prison—I felt the same way you did. He started to talk and then he didn’t back down. He was losing big because of some of the tough positions he was taking, but I was convinced at that time he was going to win. Now, you have a guy who’s not just saying he’s going to bring change—he’s bringing real hope that he’s going to stand up for something and take the hit and lose something for what he was going to get. It’s not real change unless you ruffle some feathers and make a few enemies. That I think is what President Trump is doing. I think some of the guys I was in prison with, African American guys who are seeing this new president as a very different kind of leader than Obama and frankly all the other ones that preceded President Trump leading up to his election.” Asked about the unique populist space that Trump has found in American politics, Blagojevich said he believes it is the future—whether it’s on trade deals like the USMCA, which got more than 380 votes in the House and 89 votes in the Senate, or on forthcoming major policy packages like infrastructure. He noted, too, that while he disagrees with the socialist solutions offered by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), he thinks that Sanders is zoning in on some of the core problems facing the country—and the culprits in Washington and on Wall Street behind such problems. “President Trump has filled that vacuum,” Blagojevich said. “That’s absolutely right. That’s what’s going on. You see it, frankly, even with Bernie Sanders and his supporters. He’s taken positions and views and he’s offered solutions to the problems that I think frankly are unworkable. History proves that socialism never works, and actually is counter-productive. But at least Bernie Sanders is actually talking about identifying some of the problems that are facing our country. Now, President Trump on the other hand is not only addressing those issues but he’s now the president and he’s actually achieving things and providing real, meaningful solutions that are leading to an economy that is booming because of the very things he has done whether it’s the tax cuts, reducing the regulations, and these trade deals—all are absolutely long overdue. Here again is an example of a different philosophy that Trump is offering to the American people and I think he’s speaking to a whole bunch of different people who frankly tuned out of the process long ago because they understand how full of baloney the political system has become for a long, long time. They’re now coming back into the political system.” Blagojevich added that Trump’s success is in large part marked by how many “enemies” he’s amassed in Washington trying to take him down and stop his progress. “You got a lot of voters who are not even being called by pollsters because they haven’t voted for several elections, but now because President Trump is actually bringing real change and actually keeping promises that he’s making and solving those problems and among the evidence that he’s doing it is that he’s got so many enemies that want to destroy him,” Blagojevich said. “One of the Roosevelt presidents, I think it was Franklin but it could have been Teddy, he said ‘ah, you have enemies. Good. That means you stand for something.’ The fact that President Trump is getting so much pushback and the opposition is so determined to destroy him—and that raise a whole bunch of other issues, and I’m also an expert witness on this and how when you go down and try to shake things up and change things the political establishment comes after you and destroys you personally, this is a real serious problem for another discussion—but the fact that President Trump is getting that kind of response and that the Democrats decided to abuse the impeachment process and use it as a political weapon frankly is a badge of honor for President Trump. It’s more evidence he’s doing what he said he was going to do and he’s changing things and they know it in that establishment in Washington and they don’t like it. So the more he keeps fighting and achieves things and changes things, like USMCA as you say in spite of all this opposition to be able to do the necessary things to get the bipartisan support to pass those trade deals, because he’s been able to use Twitter and the ability to communicate directly to the people, he’s been able to force those people like the operatives and congressmen in Washington to respond to his leadership and support some of his stuff because even though they don’t want to give him a political win they got to support this stuff to get re-elected. So yeah, I think there’s a tremendous space—a lot of room in that area—of those non-voters who tuned out a long time ago and I think you’re going to see President Trump being very successful in November and I think you’re going to see the number of votes that he gets will far exceed what he got the first time and a lot of those will be voters who haven’t been voting for a long time. A lot of them came out in 2016, but my prediction is a lot more of them will come out in 2020 since President Trump has proven to be different from the usual politicians. This is a guy who actually fights to get things done.” Blagojevich said that the same Democrat machine that targeted him—and Trump—is also trying to take down Sanders. That is because, he said, the Democrat Party is now “the party of Wall Street,” he said. “Absolutely, and it seems so transparent to me. This is the new Democratic Party, the Chuck Schumer-Nancy Pelosi Democratic Party,” Blagojevich said. “It’s the party—ready for this—of Wall Street. They’ve become the party of Wall Street. That’s why they sold out the American worker with NAFTA. They went to Wall Street because it’s loaded with campaign contributions. Now, the Democratic Party today because of the growth of the internet and online communications, now the Democratic Party is also the party of Silicon Valley—again, at the expense of the working person and family and the African American community because of some of the other things that they do. They cynically have abandoned the African American community and made a determination to keep that part of our nation dependent upon government in a way so that they have no other place to go but to vote for Democrats and the simple way for Democrats to keep them voting for them is call anybody who offers some kind of solution like school choice or other reforms like criminal justice reform, to call them racists. It’s a real cynical ugly kind of politics that the modern Democratic Party is engaged in. Of course they’re going to do anything they can to keep Bernie Sanders from winning and they’re going to be successful in doing it with the establishment ganging up on him. Bernie, again, is wrong on the solutions but at least he has the courage to raise the issues. I remember here’s where he was so right and I was so wrong. I remember when I was a brand new congressman back after 9/11, me and everybody else we all voted for the Patriot Act. Then there was Bernie Sanders, that crazy guy from Vermont—Bernie voted against the Patriot Act. I remember thinking how crazy he was. He was right, and we were wrong. That Patriot Act has led to the undermining of civil liberties, giving unchecked power of prosecutors who have weaponized their power and now criminalized routine practices motivated not by the desire to serve the interests of justice but instead to go after political enemies or people they want to bring down who are ruffling the feathers of the establishment. Frankly, what they did at the AAA level to a Democratic governor, to me—a lot of the same people, Comey, Fitzgerald, and Mueller, the same ones have been trying to do it at the major league level to a Republican president in President Trump. We have a lot of challenges ahead of us and the Democratic establishment abandoned these traditional voting groups and Bernie Sanders is going to pay a price because he’s got the chutzpah enough to challenge and raise questions that frankly question the establishment.” For Blagojevich, for now, he is unclear about the future—he says he wants to write a book or two, and find a way to help champion the issues he cares about–especially criminal justice reform. But one thing he is certain of: He is “everlastingly grateful” to Trump for having the “testicular virility” that he says Obama did not ever have to right the wrong he considers was done to him by the criminal justice system. “I’m not sure, it’s all very new, I’ve never come out of prison before so after eight years it’s a new experience,” Blagojevich said. “I hope to write a book or two—I’d like to write a book about my experience and what I’ve learned along the way. I think I can offer a unique perspective. I’d also like to write a book about helping people through their struggles and adversity because I share with them how I found the inspiration and the strength and purpose that worked through the long dark wilderness that I was in. I’d like maybe to be able to do something like that that could be helpful to people. I’d like to fight for criminal justice reform and I do believe I have a lot I can say about that from both sides, as a former governor where we did certain things but could have done so much more but also what I went through and have come out of. Right now, I’m doing this thing called Cameo where you do shout-outs to people and it’s a way to earn a living and it’s actually kind of nice because I’ll get a request from a daughter and she wants to celebrate her mother’s birthday so she’ll ask ‘hey governor can you say to my mother you’re a great mother and thank you for raising us children and loving us as you have?’ So you bring a little smile on the faces of people who make these requests, so that’s been nice. But in terms of what I’m going to do in the way of something lasting, it’s unclear right now. It’s all very new. But let me say this—whatever it is, it’s way better than what it was. There’s nothing like being home and being with your family and I’m blessed to be with my daughters and with my wife Patti who are the purpose and inspiration for me to come out and find a way back home. I’m grateful, everlastingly grateful, to President Trump again for having the testicular virility to trump Obama and do the right thing.” LISTEN TO FORMER ILLINOIS GOV.

"Politico continued the media’s effort to trash President Donald Trump’s response to coronavirus, citing “current and former officials” Saturday who fault the president for what they call “Trump-inspired disorganization.” The sources for Dan Diamond’s article Saturday evening are described as “13 current and former officials, as well as individuals close to the White House” — remarkably similar to the “10 current and former Trump administration officials, as well as two people close to the administration” cited in Diamond’s Feb. 26 article attacking Centers for Disease Control (CDC) director Robert Redfield. The article begins by attacking President Trump for disagreeing with Vice President Mike Pence about whether to evacuate passengers off a cruise chip near California, the Grand Princess, on which coronavirus had broken out. The president, Politico reports, wanted to keep the passengers on the ship, though he ultimately deferred to Pence as leader of the nation’s coronavirus fight. What Diamond does not note is that Politico — among others — devoted extensive coverage to criticisms of the decision to evacuate Americans last month from another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined in Japan. That is the context in which the administration is making similar decisions. The fact that President Donald Trump is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn’t suggests that there is something other than reasonable criticism on offer. Politico faults the Trump administration for “failing to secure enough testing to head off a coronavirus outbreak in the United States,” a claim that — if true — would be laid at the feet of the CDC. But while admitting that, Politico uses “current and former officials” to say that Trump’s “atmosphere” at the White House is really to blame. The “atmosphere,” Politico alleges, is one that discourages officials from giving the president bad news. But that fails to distinguish between how the government functions under Trump from how it functions under anyone else. (There were similar allegations of a bad “atmosphere” during the Obama administration when it came to intelligence reports about the fight against the so-called “Islamic State.” An inspector general’s report later found that there had been no deliberate attempts by the Obama White House to distort the intelligence, but that a perception that the administration did not want to hear “bad news” led intelligence analysts to self-censor in some of their reporting.) Politico also faults Trump for failing to appoint “a sole leader to fight the outbreak, as President Barack Obama did with Ebola in 2014.” The implication is that Obama did a good job with Ebola. But the Obama administration was perceived at the time to have bungled the response, and only belatedly put Ron Klain, a political staffer with no relevant experience, in charge.
Diamond also criticizes Trump for replacing his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, with Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), in the midst of a crisis. While it is not clear that had anything to do with coronavirus, one of the hallmarks of Trump’s administration has been the swift removal of people perceived to be doing less than the best job possible. It may not be how “politicos” think Washington ought to function, but it is how the business world works — and it is part of the reason Americans elected Trump. (Arguably, it has worked, and is working.) Politico‘s latest criticism is indistinguishable from hundreds of others that have appeared in the mainstream media since the president took office, driven by unnamed sources with apparent axes to grind and vague complaints about the president’s management style. In a similar vein, the Washington Post accused the Trump administration Saturday of “squander[ing] time” in the fight against the virus, after even the New England Journal of Medicine said that early travel restrictions “may have helped slow the spread of the virus.” The Post‘s sources: “16 current and former administration officials.”
In an atmosphere where Trump’s critics have a strong incentive to a) inflame the crisis, and b) blame it on him, it is remarkable how little the method of criticism has changed. Joel B.

"During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA) touted the coronavirus aid package and vowed House Democrats “will remain vigilant in our oversight of the administration’s efforts to ensure a thorough response that keeps Americans safe and healthy.” Transcript as Follows:  “Hello, I’m Dr. Raul Ruiz, and I represent California’s 36th Congressional District. I’m also an emergency doctor, public health expert and disaster aid specialist with medical, public health and public policy degrees from Harvard. In 2009, I was working in the emergency department when our nation was combatting the H1N1 pandemic. There, on the frontlines, I saw firsthand how important a coordinated, comprehensive, government-wide response is to addressing public health threats like the one we are currently facing. In situations like this, we must prepare for the worst as we work for the best. That’s why this week, House Democrats took early and decisive action to protect the health of the American people by passing the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act. This aid package allocates $8.3 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak, including: more than $3 billion for research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics; $2.2 billion in public health funding for prevention, preparedness and response efforts; and nearly $1 billion in support of state and local health agencies, who are on the frontlines, working night and day to defend our nation’s health. House Democrats’ aid package provides funds to reimburse state and local governments – like Riverside County in my district – for their expenses incurred while assisting with the federal response. This rapid reimbursement is essential for readiness capacity to prevent future outbreaks and treat this disease. We have passed a comprehensive funding aid package to help our public health infrastructure—but House Democrats’ work doesn’t end there. We will remain vigilant in our oversight of the Administration’s efforts to ensure a thorough response that keeps Americans safe and healthy. While Congress has passed a comprehensive supplemental to address the coronavirus, there are steps you can take personally to help keep you and your family safe and healthy. Knowledge is power. And knowing the facts about transmission and prevention reduces anxiety and empowers you to protect yourself and your community. CDC.gov is the best source of information. There, you’ll find real-time updates on the number of coronavirus cases and critical information from our nation’s leading public health experts on mitigating the spread of the virus. There are also simple things that you can do every day to protect yourself and our most vulnerable populations, like people over 60, people with weakened immune systems and people with underlying conditions like diabetes, heart and lung disease. As a physician, here’s what I’d tell my patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19: wash your hands often with warm water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue you can discard, then immediately wash your hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and, if you feel sick, stay home; and, also, clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. With these basic practices, you can and will make a difference in combatting this disease. America—we can do this. Together, we can defend our nation’s health. And, together, we can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. House Democrats are continuing to work hard For The People every day, to protect you and your family’s health—and make sure communities across our nation have the resources they need to stay safe and healthy. We have your back. Thank you.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",Dem Rep.

"A Georgia Republican lawmaker has introduced a bill that would make child transgender surgeries and drugs illegal. On February 27, Georgia State Rep. Ginny Ehrhart (R) introduced the Vulnerable Child Protection Act (HB 1060) in the Georgia House of Representatives. The legislation would ban health care professionals from performing transgender surgeries on a minor child – such as mastectomy, vaginoplasty, castration, penectomy, etc. – “for the purpose of attempting to affirm the minor’s perception of such minor’s sex, if that perception is inconsistent with such minor’s sex.” In addition, the bill would make illegal the administering of medications, such as puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones, to children for the same purpose.  “This form of child abuse is becoming a serious problem in Georgia and is evolving into a national crisis,” Ehrhart told the local CBS affiliate about her bill in October. She added: We are talking about children who have not reached the legal age of consent yet are being subjected to life-altering, irreversible surgeries and drug treatments that render them sterile and permanently disfigured. The psychological damage this does to innocent children must come to an end. This legislation makes such abusive actions criminal. Vernadette Broyles, president and general counsel of the Child and Parental Rights Campaign (CPRC), told Breitbart News in an interview the bill was partly modeled after one that came close to passing in South Dakota. Broyles’ nonprofit, public interest law firm, one she founded to defend the rights of parents to protect their children from the harms of gender ideology, was involved in the drafting of the bill. “Tremendous amounts of research went into this bill,” she said. “Medical, scientific research, and it was vetted by a variety of doctors and specialists.” Broyles said the legislation would include criminal penalties for medical professionals providing transgender drugs or surgeries to minor children, as well as the possibility of review by professional boards and for civil liability. However, the attorney added CPRC’s concern “is not the speed with which this bill precedes.” “It is more important to lay the important groundwork and to educate both legislators and Georgians about these harmful interventions that have been happening in the dark and about which most Georgians are not aware,” she explained. Broyles said her organization has been responding to what, in some cases, is “the wholesale trampling on parental rights.” As Breitbart News reported in October 2018, Broyles, working with the Georgia Adoption and Family Law Practice, co-filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department, one that focused on the sexual assault of a kindergarten girl in a Decatur school district that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. In that case, which is still working its way through the education department’s Office for Civil Rights, the mother of a five-year-old girl alleged that her daughter was sexually assaulted by a “gender-fluid” boy in the girls’ bathroom in November 2017. Broyles said: So, we began to look more closely into what’s going on in schools, and that it wasn’t just the private facilities use, that it was now in other aspects of the school, where various school systems were allowing [transgender] activists into the school, or they were allowing their teachers or their administrators to be trained by activists, such that they were bringing in either curriculum or just a mindset similar to evangelism. “I use that term very deliberately because this thing has some similar aspects to a religious belief and a cult,” the attorney added. “It’s not grounded in science, it’s grounded in a very subjective, personal metaphysical belief.” Broyles said many parents are now seeing teachers or administrators “proselytizing” this transgender belief system in their children’s schools. She said: It’s coming through a variety of different avenues into the school system, but they’re using it to indoctrinate a whole different world view of the very nature of homo sapiens. That’s one of the reasons why transgender ideology is so harmful, is that it is indoctrinating children in a worldview that says there are no boundaries. Broyles explained that her law firm comes to this issue from both a child development and children’s basic civil rights perspective, rather than a political or faith viewpoint. “Children have a central right, that should be protected, to be taught the truth about science and biology,” she asserted, adding: They have a very basic right to view their body not as their enemy, and their biological sex not as a disease. A child has the right to know that his or her biological sex is not a disease and that puberty is not a disorder. Broyles said the other danger gender ideology has created in many schools is the perspective that parents are an enemy to their children, rather than their primary advocates. She discussed situations in which some school districts are actually instructing teachers not to inform parents of a minor child’s change in “gender identity” at school. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty recently filed a lawsuit, on behalf of a group of parents, against the Madison Metropolitan School District, claiming the district violated parental rights by implementing a policy that allows children to change their gender identity without parental notice or consent. “What we’re encountering is schools having a presumption that not only are parents a potential danger to their children, or parents do not have the children’s best interests at heart, but also that it is the schools that know better,” Broyles said. “That’s putting the keys to the car in the child’s hands,” she said. “And also, automatically, the presumption is that parents are a potential threat and danger to their children.”","Georgia Bill Would Make Child Transgender Surgeries, Drugs Illegal",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/georgia-bill-would-make-child-transgender-surgeries-drugs-illegal/,Breitbart

Sanders described the president, as he has in past stump speeches, as a “pathological liar” and accused him of “moving this country into an autocracy.” While Sanders told supporters that he and his opponent, Joe Biden (D) are “friends,” he said they have different vision and records, citing the former vice president’s past positions on the Iraq War, trade agreements, and Social Security, as well as his support from super PACs and billionaires. Despite that, Sanders said Democrats will get behind the eventual nominee because the differences between those within the party are “far, far less” than the differences with this “dangerous” president. Sanders also touted his ultra-progressive positions, including his “100 percent pro-choice” voting record, promising to never appoint a judge who is not “100 percent pro-Roe v. Wade.” He also promised to “expand” funding for Planned Parenthood. The Vermont senator also harped on climate change — one of the central issues of his campaign. “Instead of spending $1.8 trillion a year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change,” he said, prompting chants of “Bernie.” Sanders added that he is prepared to take on the “whole damn one percent.” Watch the full rally below: ","Bernie Sanders Draws Crowd of 15,000 in Chicago: Trump Is ‘Moving this Country into an Autocracy’",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/bernie-sanders-draws-crowd-of-15000-in-chicago-trump-is-moving-this-country-into-an-autocracy/,Breitbart
"Super Bowl champion, businessman, and Utah Fourth Congressional District Republican candidate Burgess Owens joined Breitbart News Saturday, where he discussed the remaining Democrat presidential candidates and President Donald Trump’s commitment to all Americans. “We have a choice now between a full-fledged communist and a socialist Marxist,” Owens told host Matthew Boyle in regards to Democrat presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “This is the Democratic Party that chose these guys,” Owens continued, adding that neither of them understand “what we the people are going through.” Burgess also offered advice to those Democrats who “still love our country” and suggested that they reassess their decisions and think about whether the Democrat Party is the party they “want to be a part of.”  “I think the best decision we have been given today is Bernie Sanders or Biden against our president,” Burgess said. “They have a stark difference in the vision of our country. One is going toward pro-American, Judeo-Christian values, capitalism, and the other going Marxist, socialist, and anti-God, so it’s a good place to be.” Owens also praised President Trump for his efforts in making the American dream a possibility for all Americans. “Now that we have a president that has shown America within three years how an America-loving president should look like, they don’t know what to do next,” Owens said. “Democrats are like a wounded animal and they’re dangerous. A wounded animal is frantic. It’s crazy; it doesn’t know what to do next and that’s what’s happening to the left. They’re doing stuff that’s crazy now. They’re going further and further to the left thinking that America is going to be with them, and there’s no way it’s going to happen. Just get ready for a great turnout.” Owens also outlined Booker T. Washington’s “playbook” and related his tenants to that of President Trump’s, adding that what Washington worked so hard to attain for America is now “being seen within the Trump administration.” “Think about how angry and mean these people are,” Burgess said, jumping back to the conversation on the remaining Democrats running for president. “They’re not bringing hope.” “Don’t trust those guys,” Burgess said. “What they will do to the rest of our country is what they did to my community. What they’re doing to Chicago, Baltimore, around the world, the misery that comes with Venezuela, you name it.” Burgess also claimed neither Sanders nor Biden “have any common sense or desire to love our nation.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.","Burgess Owens: Sanders, Biden Have No ‘Common Sense or Desire to Love Our Nation’",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/burgess-owens-sanders-biden-have-no-desire-to-love-our-nation/,Breitbart

"Johns Hopkins University experts held a press briefing on Friday on Capitol Hill to discuss efforts to confront coronavirus as it spreads around the globe, including the launch of a website with an interactive dashboard that collects data worldwide about the virus, including data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).   Lauren Gardner, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, led the team that designed the dashboard, which has a wide range of always-updating data, from the number of confirmed cases (105,559), the number of deaths from the virus (3,555), the number of people who have recovered (58,354) and cases by region and country. Gardner said that statistics about users of the dashboard shows that the public is mostly using it “looking for reliable, factual information.” But local, state and federal governments, public health agencies — “and pretty much everything in between” are also using it, Gardner said. Statistics show people in the United States account for the majority of users. Gardner said her team has been taken aback but just how popular the dashboard has become. “It’s been pretty popular for awhile,” Gardner said. “At the moment we’re getting well over a billion requests per day — or interactions with this dashboard on a daily basis.” “It’s gone viral on almost every social media channel that exists,” Gardner said. “So I think that this really speaks to this huge demand for reliable, trustworthy, objective information especially around situations like these,” Gardner said.  Lauren Gardner, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, spoke about a new website the school has launched. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News) Others experts on the panel included Jason Farley, professor in the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing; Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Lisa Maragakis, epidemiologist and senior director of infection prevention for the Johns Hopkins Health System; and Andy Pekosz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Panelists called for public calm and warned about the danger of misinformation that is pumped out daily online, including on social media, where Pekosz said health experts have been engaging in conversations to try to get the facts out. Inglesby said there remains “substantial work” that still needs to be done to make the U.S. health infrastructure capable of handling the virus. And, according to Ingelsby, a vaccine that can be made available widely to the public is still 12 to 18 months out. The panel distributed literature that included tips to stop the spread of the virus, including avoiding contact with people who are sick; coughing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue properly; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; clean and disinfect objects and surfaces; stay home when sick except to seek medical help; and wash your hands with soap frequently for at least 20 seconds.

She was also snubbed by CNN’s town hall series despite the liberal network inviting former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, whose polling was lower than hers,” the article said. Following Gabbard’s request, Twitter users voiced their displeasure with the DNC’s decision to update the debate qualifications. “I don’t particularly like your politics – but I suspect Senile Joe and Comrade Sanders are deathly afraid that you’d be seen as a much more viable candidate than them if you were up there on the stage with them,” one person wrote. “Tulsi, you qualified, you deserve to be on that stage. I hate that the elite of the Democratic Party keeps doing this to you,” another commented.","Tulsi Gabbard Asks Biden, Sanders to Demand DNC Allow Her on Debate Stage",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/07/tulsi-gabbard-asks-biden-sanders-demand-dnc-allow-her-debate-stage/,Breitbart
"The Nissan Motor Company has announced that it will be doubling down on its investments in the United Kingdom, bucking predictions by anti-Brexiteers that the British car industry would crumble after Brexit. As a part of a £1 billion investment scheme at its British factory in Sunderland, Nissan announced that it has already invested £400 million to produce the next generation of its Qashqai compact crossover SUV in post-Brexit Britain. The Japanese auto-giant has installed a gigantic press to stamp out vehicle pannels for the new Qashqai. The press, which was tailor-made to produce the SUV, took 18 months to install and cost an estimated £52 million, according to The Telegraph. The new line of Qashqai SUVs is set to hit the market by 2021 and since a typical run of a model lasts for approximately five years, the 6,000 employees at the Sunderland factory will have relatively good job security until at least 2026. At the unveiling of the new production press, Ashwani Gupta, chief operating officer, said: “Designed, engineered and made in the UK, and more than three million vehicles later, it remains the benchmark, just as our team in the UK continues to set the standard for productivity and quality.” UK Employment Rate Reached Record High as It Leaves the EU https://t.co/BkI8fQPXLC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2020  In February, it was rumoured that Nissan would pull out of Continental Europe to focus on the British market, should Britain and the European Union fail to reach a trade agreement by the end of the year. If the United Kingdom leaves without a trade deal, carmakers such as Volkswagen and Ford would face import tariffs on cars sold in Britain, thereby giving companies with British production facilities, like Nissan, a competitive edge. The plan, according to two insiders at the company, vould enable the company to grow from four per cent of the market share to over twenty. Nissan denied that such a contingency plan exists, however, telling the Financial Times: ”We continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.” The statement by Nissan in February led some to believe that its factory in Sunderland could be in jeopardy in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but with the latest round of investments the company has to date spent over £4 billion at the site, and the factory remains the company’s most efficient outside of Japan.

"New Jersey police arrested 25-year-old Roosevelt Twyne for “illegally” carrying a firearm and possessing so-called “hollow point ammunition.” The Washington Free Beacon spoke to Twyne’s attorney, Evan Nappen, who said Twyne is a security guard with a permit to carry a gun. Nappen said, “He was arrested for the hollow point ammunition. Then they claimed he was transporting his handgun illegally. He had a permit to carry a handgun. The law … makes it clear that it’s illegal to transport unless you are licensed pursuant to chapter 58. And that is precisely what a handgun carry permit is.” He noted that the ammunition in Twyne’s possession, Hornady “Critical Duty” ammunition, was issued by his employer. Moreover, he pointed to the New Jersey State Police website, which shows that such ammo is not considered hollow-point ammunition in the state of New Jersey. The New Jersey State Police website says, “Ammunition lacking a hollow cavity at the tip, such as those with a polymer filling, are not considered to be hollow point ammunition. An example of this can be seen with the Hornady Critical Defense / Critical Duty, Cor-Bon PowRball / Glaser Safety Slug and Nosler Inc. Defense ammunition.” Nappen added, “[The ammo is] lawful. It’s publicly announced as lawful because it is. It’s not hollow. It’s filled.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"AMORIO, Greece (AP) – Over the years, villagers who live near Greece’s border with Turkey got used to seeing small groups of people enter their country illegally. The Greek residents often offered the just-arrived newcomers a bite to eat and directed them to the nearest police or railway station. But the warm welcomes wore off. When Turkey started channelling thousands of people to Greece, insisting that its ancient regional rival and NATO ally receive them as refugees, the Greek government sealed the border and rushed police and military reinforcements to help hold back the flood. Greeks in the border region rallied behind the expanding border force, collecting provisions and offering any possible contribution to what is seen as a national effort to stop a Turkish-spurred incursion. In several cases, authorities asked villagers familiar with the local terrain to help locate migrants who managed to slip through holes cut in a border fence or to cross the River Evros – Meric in Turkish – that demarcates most of the 212-kilometre (132-mile) border. “We were born here, we live here, we work here, we know the crossings better than anyone,” Panayiotis Ageladarakis, a community leader in Amorio, a village that lies some 300 meters (yards) from the river banks. Other villages also responded to the call for volunteer trackers. Small groups of unarmed men monitor known crossing points after dark. Video shows Turkish security forces ordering migrants to cross Greek border at gunpoint, terrifying children https://t.co/ziCZJ4AeGH — Borzou Daragahi 🖊🗒 (@borzou) March 7, 2020  “We sit at the crossings, and they come,” Ageladarakis told The Associated Press as he drove a pickup truck with a fellow Greek border village resident along a rough track at night. “We keep them there most of the time, call police and they come and arrest them. Then, it’s a matter for the police. We aren’t interested in where they take them. We just try to help this effort taking place by the army and the police.” Help for the border units also came from Evros businesses and store owners. Nikos Georgiadis, head of the local restaurant owners’ association, said his colleagues delivered food and water to units stationed at four points on the border. “They also asked us for masks and gloves, and we’ll try to find some,” he said. Ageladarakis said all the migrants he encountered over the past few days were cooperative. “These people are frightened. Nobody has caused any trouble,” he said. But the village community leader said that in his view, the people he encountered did not look like they were fleeing wars in their own countries. “There’s nobody coming from a war,” he said. “None of them are refugees. They’re all illegal migrants and that’s why they’re trying to get into Europe [this way].” Greek authorities said that out of the 252 people arrested for illegal entry over the past week as of Friday, 64 per cent were Afghans, 19 per cent Pakistanis, 5 per cent Turks and 4 per cent Syrians, while the others were from Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Egypt.

"Five teenage boys have been charged in connection with an alleged attack on a teenage girl in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said the five suspects, whose ages range from 14 to 17, turned themselves in to the 77th precinct, according to ABC 7. “All five were charged as minors with robbery and assault. Their fate will be decided in Family Court,” the report stated. Video footage of the incident showed one suspect running toward the 15-year-old girl and kicking her as she lay on the sidewalk. Moments later, several others ran up and also assaulted her. When the group began to disperse, a man reached down and pulled off her tennis shoes, then walked away from the scene holding them as the other suspects followed. Officials said the girl’s cell phone and debit card were also stolen. She was later transported to a hospital with bruising and swelling on her face but is expected to recover. Friday, the NYPD tweeted the video and asked the public for help identifying the suspects: 🚨WANTED for ROBBERY/GANG ASSAULT: On 3/5, at approx 4:10 PM, in front of 216 Utica Ave in Brooklyn, a 15-year-old female was approached by a group of individuals & was punched & kicked to the ground & had her property removed. Any info call or DM @NYPDTips at 800-577-TIPS. pic.twitter.com/JjCCFbnhSJ — NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) March 6, 2020  In a media release Thursday, the department said the recent criminal justice reforms were the “significant reason” New York City has seen a rise in crime this year. The release continued: In the first 58 days of 2020, 482 individuals who had already been arrested for committing a serious (felony) crime such as robbery or burglary were rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Thirty-five percent, or 299, were for arrests in the seven major crime categories – murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto – that is nearly triple the amount of those crimes committed in the same 58 days in 2019. All of [sic] people were arrested for offenses that prior to Jan 1 and bail reform, could have landed them in jail. At a town hall event in February, Mayor Bill de Blasio dismissed Queens residents’ concerns about the growing crime rate and accused them of “whipping up fear.” “There are people and organizations in this city that are trying to tell you New York City is not safe, that are trying to tell you we are declining and we’re going back to the ’70s,” he told them. “Listen, listen if you believe that, God bless you.

"Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) has scheduled a vote for the committee next Wednesday to subpoena former Ukrainian politician Andrii Telizhenko, who may shed insight into Hunter Biden’s potential role in trying to help Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings evade corruption charges. A committee meeting to consider a motion to subpoena Telizhenko is scheduled for March 11 at 2:30 p.m., according to a public posting on the committee’s website. The motion will likely pass, with a majority of Republicans on the committee. Telizhenko was a former Ukrainian diplomat. He worked at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington, DC, between December 2015 and June 2016, as the U.S. presidential campaign was underway, according to the Daily Beast. Telizhenko has claimed that former Ukrainian Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Oksana Shulyar worked with former Democratic National Committee (DNC) consultant Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American, to help the Hillary Clinton campaign investigate then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. He told Politico in a January 2017 article that Shulyar instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort, and Russia. “Oksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,” he said. “They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa.” He added, “Oksana was keeping it all quiet [but] the embassy worked very closely with” Chalupa. Other “sources familiar with the effort” told Politico that Shulyar called Telizhenko into a meeting with Chalupa to provide an update on an American media outlet’s ongoing investigation into Manafort. He said Chalupa told him and Shulyar, “If we can get enough information on Paul [Manafort] or Trump’s involvement with Russia, she can get a hearing in Congress by September [2016].” Chalupa confirmed to Politico that she had discussed the possibility of a congressional investigation with the office of Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, but that it “didn’t go anywhere.” Johnson’s subpoena to Telizhenko, however, is focused on his work as a consultant for Blue Star Strategies, a firm Burisma hired to fight allegations of corruption it was facing. Burisma appointed Hunter Biden to its board in 2014, after his father became the point person in the Obama administration for Ukraine and as the firm’s CEO was facing allegations of corruption and money laundering. Despite having no relevant experience, he was receiving up to $83,000 a month. After Biden’s appointment to the board, Burisma hired Blue Star Strategies to help them fight off the allegations of corruption and to lobby U.S. officials on its behalf. The New York Times reported in May 2019 that Hunter Biden was linked to Burisma’s hiring of Blue Star Strategies. “Among the Americans brought in by Hunter Biden’s American business partners to help fend off the investigations was Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm run by Clinton administration veterans that had done substantial work in Ukraine,” the report said. Biden had links to one of Blue Star Strategies’ co-founders — Sally Painter, a former senior adviser for the Clinton administration. He knew Painter from the Truman National Security Project, an organization for young national security experts on the left. Biden and Painter were both directors of the organization at the same time, according to the Washington Free Beacon. The other co-founder was Karen Tramontano, a former deputy chief of staff to President Clinton. While Painter was working for Burisma, she moderated a panel at a Truman National Security Project event on June 24, 2016. Then-Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken had spoken earlier at that event. Three days later, she contacted Blinken’s then-aide William Russo, to schedule a meeting with Blinken and Tramontano to discuss Ukraine, according to the Daily Caller. Painter wrote to Russo, who currently serves as director of communications for Biden’s presidential campaign, “Per my conversation with Tony at the Truman event, Karen Tramontano and I would like to have a brief coffee with Tony at his earliest convenience regarding some troubling events we are seeing n [sic] Ukraine.” “(He said yes),” she added, referring to Blinken, who currently serves as foreign policy advisor to Biden’s presidential campaign. “We are just back from Kiev.” According to the Times, a team from Blue Star Strategies, including John Buretta, a lawyer who served as a senior official in the Obama Justice Department, had two meetings in Ukraine with its top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, in 2016. Lutsenko replaced Viktor Shokin, whom Joe Biden has stated publicly he pressured Ukraine to fire. Lutsenko had taken a hard line against Burisma, but within 10 months of taking office, Burisma announced he and the Ukrainian courts had “fully closed” all “legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations” against Burisma’s CEO and his companies and that he had been removed by a Ukrainian court from “the wanted list,” according to the Times. Sen. Johnson said in a March 1, 2020, letter to colleagues that he has received U.S. government records indicating that Blue Star Strategies sought to use Hunter Biden’s role as a board member of Burisma to “gain access to, and potentially influence matters at, the State Department.” He said the committee has also requested and received documents from Blue Star Strategies and Telizhenko. However, he said Telizhenko said he cannot turn over all relevant records unless he is compelled by a subpoena, since some of them are subject to a non-disclosure agreement in his employee contract and Blue Star Strategies has been unwilling to turn over the records, according to Johnson’s letter. “Because Mr. Telizhenko’s records and information would be responsive to the Committee’s requests, and Blue Star [Strategies] has refused to produce them, a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko for these records is appropriate at this time,” Johnson wrote. Democrats have blasted the subpoena as an attempt to hurt Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, although Johnson’s efforts were in the works weeks before he announced this week he would seek a subpoena. His committee’s investigation into Burisma has also been going on for nearly a year. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) reportedly was considering voting against the motion, but CNN reported Friday that he would vote to pass the motion — likely ensuring its passage — after receiving assurances from Johnson that the investigation would not become a public spectacle. Johnson also announced this week that he would likely issue an interim report within a month or two focused on what Joe Biden knew about his son Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Senate GOP Investigation into Burisma-Biden Heats Up with Subpoena Planned Next Week,2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/senate-gop-investigation-into-burisma-biden-heats-up-with-subpoena-planned-next-week/,Breitbart
"Left-wing actress Bette Midler took her public disdain for President Donald Trump up a notch on Friday, defending “powerhouse” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) from the president’s critiques, calling him the “most hated, most repulsive human male on the planet today.” “#EllizabethWarren is a powerhouse, but Donald Trump, that stable genius, said she was unlikeable,” the Beaches actress said one day after Warren’s announcement. “Well, Don, in breaking news, she’s 100% more likable than you!

They like a person like me that’s not mean.” Despite her defense of Warren, Midler affirmed her support for Mike Bloomberg (D) on Super Tuesday, telling her 1.8 million followers that she was “all in” for the former New York City mayor. “TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, as if you didn’t know. And I am all in for @MikeBloomberg. Rail at me all you want, but I saw New York City go from being down on its knees to standing upright and proud after 9-11,” the Hocus Pocus actress said. “It was a long haul, tough; not without mistakes, but he got it done.” TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, as if you didn't know.

They had men all over the place … [but] this time, they were met by dozens of Texans … who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom.

"Actress and climate activist Jane Fonda has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, calling him the “climate candidate” prior to leading her latest environmental protest in Southern California. During her demonstration, the actress decried oil and gas companies while blaming “a small bunch of white men getting really rich” for causing pollution and health problems for those who live near drilling sites. Jane Fonda led a demonstration Friday in San Pedro and the suburb of Wilmington to protest the fossil fuel industry, demanding that companies put a stop to new drilling activity. The Hollywood star spoke to USA Today before the rally, saying that Sen.

The socialist candidate has already garnered support from stars including Cardi B, Lizzo, Susan Sarandon, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. “There’s a small bunch of white men getting really rich while they’re destroying the health of the people like the people you heard from. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. And guess what: it’s happening all across the country and all across the world,” she said. “We have to say no more fossil fuels.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that his campaign had raised $22 million in five days following a win in South Carolina and a surge of Super Tuesday wins. Biden’s victory in ten out of 14 states that voted on Tuesday put new life into a campaign that was left for dead just weeks before when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was in the lead. The Democrat former vice president told his supporters all of this on a call on Friday in a fundraising update, giving them a warning that the “Bernie Brothers” would be conducting an “increasingly negative” campaign. “What we can’t let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath,” Biden said. “I know I’m going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the Bernie Brothers will run.” “We can’t tear this party apart and reelect Trump,” he added. “We have to keep our eyes on the ball, in my view.” “Bernie Bros” has been the term to describe hardline Sanders supporters since his 2016 election campaign. These “Bernie Bros” have received a lot of pushback for their aggressive tactics on social media, especially on Twitter. Biden and Sanders are set to face off in the next set of primaries on Tuesday, with Idaho, Michigan, Washington, Mississippi, Missouri, and North Dakota all set to vote that day. In one poll taken among Missouri voters, Biden holds a slight edge over Sanders, and another poll taken after Sen.

"The coronavirus outbreak revealed “moral hypocrisy” on the part of global leaders, assessed Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, author of Lust for Love: Rekindling Intimacy and Passion in Your Relationship, describing the West’s decades of dealings with both China and Iran amidst human rights abuses across prior decades as acceptance of the two states’ “moral virus.” Boteach offered his remarks on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with special guest host Joel Pollak. “If you want to look for just how the coronavirus has exposed some of the moral rot of our society, you will notice that when China was imprisoning its own Nobel Peace Prize winner — a political dissident who died in custody and his wife was also imprisoned — when China was just brutalizing citizens for expressing an opinion, we had no issue visiting there,” said Boteach. Boteach added, “[We were] not pushing them to better their human rights record. When Iran was threatening the Jews with a second Holocaust, we had no issues whatsoever in doing the Iran nuclear agreement, and the Europeans were running there to do deals for oil, but when there was a threat to our souls, our morality, our goodness, our ethics, our values, [and] our convictions, nobody gave a damn, but the moment there was a threat to our body … ‘Oh no, I’m not going to go.'” LISTEN:  “It just kind of exposes the moral hypocrisy,” continued Boteach. “We should always have had issues with Iran, not because they have the coronavirus, but because they had a moral virus because they were not ethical people because the mullahs were monsters threatening a genocide.” American foreign policy should be grounded in human rights, Boteach determined.   “We have to be moral people, and our foreign policy should be governed not just by whether or not countries have infectious diseases, but whether they have a human rights that we Americans can respect,” Boteach said. Asked about the religious response to the coronavirus outbreak, Boteach replied, “We have to emphasize life. We have to protect life.

"The coronavirus outbreak demonstrates the need for a healthcare “safety net,” as well as innovation only the private sector can provide, according to  University economics professor Kenneth Rogoff. Rogoff, author of This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, addressed the possible economic impacts of coronavirus in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak. Pollak asked what economic lessons can be learned from the ongoing coronavirus spread. “There is certainly a lesson for having a safety net so that so that if you’re facing a pandemic, you could treat everyone and really have a framework [so] people aren’t afraid to come in and you can treat everyone,” replied Rogoff. Government healthcare policy must be balanced with free-market forces, added Rogoff.  “The whole world depends on the United States for the innovation in drugs and health care, and there’s a very good chance that the vaccine’s going to come from here because we have this very developed private sector, and the question is how to have a system that has both.” LISTEN:
 Government-driven redistributive responses to the coronavirus threat will be favored by those seeking expansion of state power, noted Rogoff. “If you think this would be a good idea anyways, particularly fighting inequality, then you’re not so nervous about trying to increase transfers to people to deal with that,” Rogoff said. “If it turned out the [coronvirus threat] wasn’t so bad, you kind of wanted to make the government bigger [and] you kind of wanted to do these transfers anyway, so you’re willing to err on that direction, but clearly the most effective expenditures you could make are ones that address the problem, [such as] that build up the health sector.” Rogoff proposed some possible government measures to address the coronavirus threat: “Certainly having people get free tests, for example, if they want to, or possibly finding ways to make it easier to call in sick might be a short-term solution [and among the] kinds of things to government can spend money on.” Government policy, Rogoff said, must also seek to “stem the panic,” but should aim beyond financial concerns alone. “[T]he panic is not just about [if] their money [is] in the bank. The panic is much more about people’s health.” Rogoff predicted: “We’re going to end up doing stimulus policies out of this, even in the United States, even with the civil war going on in the political sphere. They’re going to do some kind of significant fiscal stimulus this year to try to mitigate the coronavirus. Call me an optimist, but I’m expecting that.” Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

"Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week,” former Chicago Mayor and former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel sounded off on the 2020 presidential race amid the coronavirus outbreak. Emanuel said the coronavirus precautions preventing President Donald Trump from having his typical rallies and thus missing out on the admiration he craves will be “devastating” and will “psychologically torment him.” “This administration right now looks like they couldn’t organize a one-car parade,” Emanuel stated. “And I think here’s what’s devastating for Donald Trump — beyond the fact that this requires science, management, data and being transparent, which are all his weaknesses — you’re going to have a point that within about two months where you can’t have big events together.” He added, “He is not going to be able to have his rallies, and it is going to psychologically — the office is isolating enough, and his inability to get the admiration, the adulation from that crowds is going to psychologically torment him.

"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) on Sunday voiced his displeasure with the Democrats for the $8.3 billion spending bill to combat the spread of the coronavirus not being out earlier. McCarthy said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the bill, which President Donald Trump signed Friday, was held so Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL) could run ads against Republicans, adding the bill should have been out a week earlier. “We should have had the bill a week earlier,” McCarthy told host Maria Bartiromo. “The Democrats actually held this bill so Congresswoman Bustos, who runs the DCCC, could run ads against Republicans. There should be no politics in this because, as you said, Maria, this is very serious and we should take it for the seriousness that it should be.” He continued, “$8.3 billion, and it does three main things: testing, treatment and telehealth, which is very important because what you want to do is make sure you have containment but make sure these people are able to get the treatment they need, and we were able to make a revision in that where people would use technology today to be able to talk to a doctor, not going out and affecting everybody else around them and make a real difference to this.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",McCarthy Slams Dems for Delaying Coronavirus Bill to Run Ads Against Republicans — ‘We Should Have Had the Bill a Week Earlier’,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/08/mccarthy-slams-dems-for-delaying-coronavirus-bill-to-run-ads-against-republicans-we-should-have-had-the-bill-a-week-earlier/,Breitbart

In reaction to Cruz’s announcement, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) praised his fellow senator’s decision, saying Cruz is “modeling good behavior” by self-quarantining. “He is modeling good behavior saying he will self-quarantine at home and stay away from the public and Congress,” Merkley told Kasie Hunt, host of MSNBC’s “Kasie DC.” Merkley listed off ways to combat the spread of the coronavirus such as bumping elbows instead of shaking hands and frequently cleaning hands. He added, “[W]e’re trying to bring that behavior and convey to people that really this is — think of the flu. If you hand wash a lot, if you cough into your sleeve, if you use fluids on your hands …hand sanitizer, you keep your hands away from your face you greatly reduce the spread, so these are the type of behaviors that all of us in leadership should be modeling. I did a video to convey this and I encourage other folks in elected office to do that.

"A “birth tourism” hotel in Orange County, California, may be shut down by the local city council after years of helping Chinese women deliver their children in the United States for the sole purpose of securing birthright American citizenship. Last week, the planning commission board in Orange County voted to strip the JR Motel of its permit after years of it operating to secure birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of Chinese women with little-to-no ties to the U.S. The Orange County Register reported that birth tourism has “become common in southern California” and that the JR Motel was filled with nurseries and strollers while staff would help Chinese women schedule and travel to doctor’s appointments. The hotel, according to the planning commission, does not take public reservations. Officials with the planning commission said they were not stripping the birth tourism hotel of their permit because the owner is operating a birth tourism business, but because his intentions were not clear when he secured the permit in 2015. As Breitbart News reported in December, a Chinese national was convicted and sentenced to just ten months in prison for operating a birth tourism business that helped secure birthright American citizenship for the children of more than 500 pregnant foreigners, earning $3 million in the process. In January, President Donald Trump’s administration issued a new regulation allowing consular officers who grant B-1 and B-2 visas, temporary business and tourist visas, the ability to deny such visas if they believe a foreign national intends to travel to the country for the primary purpose of delivering a child on U.S. soil and thus securing them birthright citizenship. Every year, as Breitbart News reported, the birth tourism industry delivers about 33,000 U.S.-born children, commonly referred to as “anchor babies,” who secure birthright American citizenship despite their foreign parents having only come to the country on visitor visas. Previous research has put the annual estimate for birth tourism anchor babies at 36,000. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Gosar said neither he nor his staff are exhibiting any symptoms of the illness, which has caused thousands of deaths worldwide after its mysterious outbreak in China’s Wuhan region. “However, in order to prevent any potential transmission, I will remain at my home in Arizona until the conclusion of the 14 day period following my interaction with this individual,” he announced. “Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, I am closing my office in Washington, D.C. for the week,” and his staff will telecommute in the meantime. He further stated on social media that three senior staff members will also self-quarantine. 1.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said in a statement on Sunday that he had been exposed to a CPAC attendee who tested positive for coronavirus. Cruz said that he is currently not experiencing any symptoms of coronavirus and that he plans to stay at home until he has waited a full two weeks since he was exposed to coronavirus at CPAC. He said: Last night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for COVID-19. That interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake. I have consulted with medical authorities from the Houston Health Department, the Harris County Public Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as my personal physician. I have also spoken with Vice President Pence, Leader McConnell, and Mark Meadows. I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy. Given that the interaction was 10 days ago, that the average incubation period is 5-6 days, that the interaction was for less than a minute, and that I have no current symptoms, the medical authorities have advised me that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low. The physicians further advised that testing is not effective before symptoms manifest, and my brief interaction with the individual does not meet the CDC criteria for self-quarantine. The medical authorities explicitly advised me that, given the above criteria, the people who have interacted with me in the 10 days since CPAC should not be concerned about potential transmission. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because of how frequently I interact with my constituents as a part of my job and to give everyone peace of mind, I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, until a full 14 days have passed since the CPAC interaction. Today I released the following statement: pic.twitter.com/XGXEa4ozcg — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) March 8, 2020  Cruz’s statement follows as the American Conservative Union announced on Saturday that one attendee at CPAC had tested positive for Coronavirus. The ACU said that the individual did not interact with President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and “never attended events in the main hall.” Cruz said, “Everyone should continue to treat this outbreak seriously and be driven by facts and medical science.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"Delaware Republican congressional candidate Lee Murphy told Breitbart News Saturday that Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) has achieved nothing in Congress except for obstructing President Donald Trump’s agenda. Murphy, a former Amtrak locomotive engineer, hopes to unseat Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) for the state’s at-large congressional district. Murphy noted that even though the Cook Political Report said that the election gives Rochester a six-point advantage, he can still likely win because the congresswoman has not achieved any victories in Congress. He told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “We’re running against a woman who’s done nothing in three and a half years in office except obstruct the president, and of course, she voted for the president … and she aligns herself with the radical Democrat party in Congress.”  Murphy said that he hopes to channel his blue-collar background to win over the union vote in Delaware. “I’m a blue-collar guy; I worked on a railroad all my life. I was a locomotive engineer for Amtrak,” the Delaware Republican said. Breitbart News Saturday host Boyle noted that the Republican Party is going through a “big political realignment.” He added that earlier on the show, they had on former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who told Boyle why he considers himself a “Trumpocrat.” Murphy said he sees hope in his election chances considering that the state is “more working-class than ever.” Murphy said that gun rights are a “hot issue” in the state, saying that “like Virginia, they’re trying to take our rights away in Delaware.” He added that he sees a “pathway for victory” if there is a “strong Republican turnout” and “dismal turnout” for his Democrat opponent.” Murphy said that Delaware could have a representative who has commonsense values and would actually work with the president to better his state. Republicans need to retake roughly 18 seats to regain the House majority. If Murphy were to unseat his Democrat opponent, it would make it one district easier for Republicans to retake the majority. “Delaware will be in the spotlight and need to take this congressional seat back here to help President Trump take back Congress in 2020. I’m confident in our little state,” he said. Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M Eastern. Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"Five nationals from Chile have been arrested after securing tourist visas to travel to the United States with the intention to allegedly burglarize wealthy residents of California and New York. Chilean nationals Amaro Rosas, Bayron Palta, Fabian Catalan, Juan Rosas, and William Perez were arrested by Nassau County, New York, law enforcement officials after they were tied to a series of burglaries in the wealthy neighborhoods of Sands Point, Locust Valley, Great Neck, and Glen Cove. The Chilean nationals are part of a burglary ring that were able to legally arrive in the U.S. after securing B-2 tourist visas. Nassau County officials said the five men entered on their tourist visas through the U.S.-Mexico border and arrived in southern California before making their way to New York. When they first arrived in the U.S., Nassau County officials said the Chilean nationals burglarized homes in the wealthy Beverly Hills, California, neighborhood — where some of the nation’s wealthiest elite have residences. Then, after burglarizing those homes, Nassau County officials said the five men traveled to New York where they allegedly broke into Long Island homes in four neighborhoods. The Chilean nationals allegedly stole $30,000 worth of watches and $8,000 in cash, according to Nassau County officials. Nassau County officials said the Chilean nationals gave them fake IDs from Argentina and warned that this is the third group of Chileans to be arrested for burglary in Long Island after being allowed to legally enter the U.S. on tourist visas. All five men are being held without bail. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"New York Post journalist Jon Levine was locked out of his Twitter account earlier today and forced to delete several tweets in connection to his article exposing the ultra-wealthy background of socialist YouTuber Carlos Maza. Twitter first locked Levine out of his account this morning, but after inquiries from the journalist and his followers, the platform restored access to his account, claiming that the lockout had been an “error” and that his tweets about Maza did not violate the platform’s policies. However, later in the day, Twitter changed its mind again, telling Levine that “upon further investigation, these tweets violate our Twitter rules, specifically our private information policy.” Levine had tweeted pictures from his recent article, “YouTube socialist Carlos Maza slams the wealthy but lived in luxury,” showing pictures of a $10 million mansion in Florida owned by Maza’s family. The pictures are publicly viewable on real estate websites, where Levine obtained them. Levine’s tweets were archived and can be viewed here. They reveal information about the mega-wealthy background of socialist Maza. Twitter claimed that Levine posting publicly-available images of Maza was a violation of its “private information policy.” Yet Maza has done the same — last month, he called out establishment Democrat James Carville for living in an “obscene four-story mansion,” posting images of the residence to prove it.

Last year, using his position as a writer for far-left Vox.com, Maza pressured YouTube into demonetizing videos from conservative commentator Stephen Crowder, an act that led to the condemnation of the Google-owned platform from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and others. In the aftermath of the controversy, YouTube cracked down on content across its platform. In a tweet about Twitter’s censorship, Levine called the platform’s actions “Orwellian.” SECOND UPDATE: Despite initially calling their decision to lock my account “an error” — Twitter locked me out again a few hours later over the same Carlos Maza story.

"On her Saturday program, Fox News Channel’s Jeanine Pirro used her “Opening Statement” segment to argue the manner in which the media are handling coronavirus was proof of bias and the coverage was meant to damage President Donald Trump. Transcript as follows: PIRRO: If you’ve ever had a question whether the mainstream media distorts, whips up, throws things out of focus or has an agenda, especially when it comes to the Trump administration, look no further than coronavirus. If you listen to the mainstream media, it’s time to buy the family burial plot, visit the cemetery where the dirt is definitely cleaner than your kitchen counter or your bathroom handles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: The coronavirus outbreak has the potential to become a global pandemic. JOY BEHAR, ABC HOST: Don’t listen to Trump. Don’t listen to him. Let’s face it, the President is a reality — LAWRENCE O’DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: The response to the coronavirus in the United States is being led by the most incompetent and ignorant President in history. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: So what’s the downside of their Doomsday reporting? The downside is predictable. When people are scared, when people think it’s just a question of time before they start dropping like flies, they go into survival mode. They don’t spend money. The economy suffers. They don’t invest. The market suffers. They talk about taking their children out of school, education suffers. They talk about canceling March Madness, Coachella, and local businesses suffer. And canceling airlines and cruise ship reservations, the economy suffers. They go into depression mode because their quality of life is over. And who better to trumpet a slowing economy than CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Wall Street is rattled by the worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus.

Where were you when the Dow, the S&P 500, and NASDAQ all repeatedly reached record highs under President Trump? You weren’t interested then, were you? Where were you when the Dow closed at a record high more than 100 times since Donald Trump’s election? Where were you when animal spirits were driving this country to new economic heights? And for your information, our economy can sustain a 3,000-point drop because we are at record highs. Job numbers just came out, and they’re up beyond expectations. The stock market is up for the week. Long-term interest rates are plunging, so people can refinance, and those who need subsidies are going to get them. And the media complains that there was a lackluster initial response by the Trump administration. Say what? Let’s start with the fact that the U.S. has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. And on January 31st, the Trump administration restricted entry into this country from China in an effort to counter the spreading coronavirus outbreak. Even The New York Times noted the administration barred entry by most foreign nationals who had recently visited China. American travelers were under quarantine, as the administration declared a rare public health emergency. The President did this knowing that it would send shocks through the stock market, that it would rattle industry between the world’s two largest economies. He immediately put together the smartest, most sophisticated team of doctors, scientists, and healthcare professionals to deal with his declared coronavirus health emergency. And most important, he assigned to Vice President Mike Pence the job of organizing, monitoring a team to contain, mitigate and treat the problem working with states and local governments. His efforts have been non-stop, keenly focused, and heralded the political criticisms by the left like Governor Inslee of Washington State and Governor Cuomo of New York State are nothing more than political gamesmanship that have no place in this effort. The effort to develop a vaccine making testing kits available to every state lab and available to every doctor in this country with a minimum of $4 million going to each of the 50 states is underway. So, what to do? It’s a virus, like the flu. It actually can be mistaken for the flu, a sore throat, a cough, a fever. And by the way, it is flu season. You say, but people are dying. Sadly, that’s true. And not only are condolences in order, but we owe it to their families and all Americans to come up with a vaccine. Like the flu, tests for coronavirus are now being made available to every state lab. Clinical trials will begin within five weeks for the vaccine. The Federal government is working continuous, vigorously and forcefully to cut the bureaucratic red tape that often slows down vaccine approval. And rest assured the best, the brightest, and the resolute are working non-stop to create this vaccine. Now, they say the mortality rate for coronavirus is higher than a flu. But consider though that we have a flu vaccine, and yet in 2019, sixteen thousand Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have the flu vaccine, the flu would be a pandemic. So all the talk about coronavirus being so much more deadly doesn’t reflect reality. Without a vaccine, the flu would be far more deadly. Now, what we do know is the mortality rate is much higher among elderly adults. According to reports, the risk of dying if infected with the coronavirus is higher the older you are, which might explain why they say children are not really affected by the virus. But in addition to age, as Dr. Anthony Fauci has said, the risk is greater if you, as an elderly person, have an underlying medical condition like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, it is certainly higher if you’re a smoker, which might explain why China has such a high mortality rate. Some studies have estimated that as many as 50 percent of Chinese men are smokers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL MAHER, HBO TALK SHOW HOST: I’m sick of the virus, but not from the virus. People die. That’s what happens in life. The BP oil spill was going to end the world and every other [bleep] we’ve ever had. And it didn’t. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: So, what to do? Wash your hands. I know everyone thinks there’s got to be more to this. The reason you wash your hands is to get the germs off. The reason why you need to get the germs off is because you can then transfer them to your eyes, your nose, your mouth, risking infection to your respiratory system. You’re looking now at a California genius, a medical doctor from their state health department, lecturing how not to touch your face as the woman repeatedly touches the surface then her face and literally puts her fingers in her mouth. Whatever you have to do, don’t touch your face. And gloves won’t matter because the virus can last for hours on them and surfaces. So whether you need to borrow your dog’s shock collar or go out and buy a straightjacket, don’t touch your face. Don’t share drinking glasses, eating utensils, clean all high touch surfaces every day like counters and tabletops and doorknobs and stay at home if you feel sick. And as the Surgeon General said on JUSTICE last week, you don’t need a mask unless you’re sick and there’s no need to go out and clean out the store shelves. As the weather warms, fewer and fewer people will get sick with the virus. Some of the meds need to be left for people who may need them. And if you want to complain about something, complain about the fact that we rely on China and even India for ingredients for some of our medication, even the meds themselves. Like Nuclear Medicine and Moly 99, it is time to have a supply chain for our medicine in the United States. Time to make America first there. So maybe Bill Maher has the right attitude. Stop panicking, fear-mongering, hiding under your bed, and freaking out. In fact — (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP OF MOVIE “MOONSTRUCK”) CHER, PLAYING LORETTA CASTORINI IN MOVIE “MOONSTRUCK”: Snap out of it.

"An immigrant from Egypt has been accused of murdering a 19-year-old girl and her 21-year-old boyfriend in southern Virginia last month, Breitbart News has exclusively learned. Last month, 18-year-old Mohamed Aly was arrested for the alleged murder of 19-year-old Ayanna Maertens-Griffin and 21-year-old Joel Bianda, her boyfriend, WUSA9 reported at the time. The bodies of Maertens-Griffin and Bianda were found by on a highway median in Tuberville, Virginia, next to a silver Nissan Maxima. From the start of the investigation, Virginia State Police believed the couple’s deaths were the result of murder, not a car accident. Ayanna Maertens-Griffin, 19-years-old, and her boyfriend Joel Bianda, 21-years-old, were allegedly murdered by an 18-year-old immigrant from Egypt, Mohamed Aly. (GoFundMe) Days after their bodies were found, Virginia law enforcement officials arrested Aly — who lives in Alexandria, Virginia — on two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of felony use of a firearm. Breitbart News has exclusively learned that Aly first arrived in the U.S. as the child of an American citizen sometime in the early 2000s. A law enforcement official confirmed to Breitbart News that Aly has been a permanent legal resident with a green card since about 2005. In statements to local media, the victims’ families have said they are heartbroken by their loved ones’ deaths. “It’s completely broken all of our hearts,” Maertens-Griffin’s aunt Kassie Rich said. “I don’t even know if we’re going to officially figure out everything, but we hope and pray that we do.” Family and friends have created a GoFundMe page for Maertens-Griffin’s family. More than $12,000 has been raised since February. Likewise, Bianda’s family set up a GoFundMe page, expressing their grief and the fact that the young man was days away from his 22nd birthday. “Joel’s dream was to make it big with his music and to be able to make enough money to take care and move others,” Bianda’s brother wrote on the page. “He loved us with all of his heart. He died at the age of 21, just 16 days after his birthday.

"Florida conservative and third congressional district Republican candidate Judson Sapp told Breitbart News Saturday that he hopes to increase the number of “Trump Republicans” in Congress. Sapp, the CEO of W.J. Sapp Railroad Contractor, hopes to replace the retiring Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL). Sapp has also served on the 2020 Trump Victory Finance Committee. He told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle that he hopes to expand the number of “Trump Republicans in office.” Sapp said, “I was at the Trump Victory on the Finance Committee very early when he relaunched his reelection campaign, and it’s been a privilege. And I think that’s what we see a lot of in Congress. We have a lot of people saying they’re Trump supporters; they say that they support the president. They don’t actually do anything other than lip service. I’m out there on the front lines getting the president reelected. When I get into Congress, I’m going to do the same thing; I would love for the president to start rebranding certain Congress-people ‘Trump Republicans.'”  The Florida Republican said that the some moderate Republicans’ opposition to President Trump’s national emergency on the border inspired him to run for office. Trump’s national emergency declaration granted him the authority to build the wall along America’s southern border. Roughly 13 House Republicans have voted for legislation in February that would terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration and thus make it much harder for the president to secure the border. “One of the things that inspired me to run was the lack of support from congressional members and, of course, senate members,” Sapp said. He added, “When we take back the House, that has to be an issue and it has to be done quickly to support our president.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

"Donald Trump Jr. on Sunday said he wanted to debate former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter over who has used their father’s government position to benefit financially. Trump Jr. challenged Hunter via Twitter and during an interview with Axios, adding that he is willing to release his taxes if the former VP’s son makes his public as well. Citing his interview with Axios on Twitter, President Donald Trump’s eldest son declared: The [mainstream media] loves making a false equivalency between us, so let’s settle it: I challenge Hunter Biden to man up & debate me. Hunter releases his tax returns & I release mine. Let’s have an open [conversation] about who really profited from their father’s public office! The MSM loves making a false equivalency between us, so lets settle it: I challenge Hunter Biden to man up & debate me@JimVandeHei moderates. Hunter releases his tax returns & I release mine. Let's have an open convo about who really profited from their father's public office! pic.twitter.com/6N6MObhGhb — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 8, 2020  “We can go full transparency, we show everything, and we can talk about all of the places where I am supposedly grifting but Hunter Biden isn’t,” Trump Jr. added during his interview with Axios. President Trump’s son stressed that the difference between Hunter and himself is that he made money working for his father as a private businessman while Joe’s son benefited from his father’s taxpayer-funded government position. Trump Jr. told Axios: The difference is I made a lot of money from my father because I worked in his company for 20 years as a private businessman. Hunter Biden got lucrative jobs at MBNA, the biggest bank in the state of Delaware, where daddy happened to be a senator. Where dad also happened to be signing favorable banking legislation that seemed to track where he was getting his raises and his promotions. “Hunter Biden, then about the age of 28 maybe, got on the board of Amtrak,” he continued. “Obviously, he is a locomotive fan,” Trump Jr. quipped. “He knows a lot about these things. No-one believes this. Show me where I’m taking those board seats.” When Axios accused Trump Jr. of benefitting financially during his father’s tenure as president from his book deal and paid speeches, he replied: Nothing that I haven’t done before and again if you look at my tax returns — which maybe we can talk about in this debate — you can see that I haven’t raised and made anymore money than I probably have been for the last few years before we got into politics. So I’d be happy to have that conversation. “I’ve done paid speeches for over a decade,” Trump Jr. also said, later adding, “I don’t even do the international ones anymore.” Asked by Axios if he would release his tax returns, the president’s son, who still runs the Trump Organization with his brother Eric, responded, “If we do it both, 100 percent. Let’s talk about who profited off of whose public service. Happy to do it. Let’s make it happen.” “It is hard to believe anything a Trump says on tax returns when Donald Sr. has lied for years about releasing his,”
TJ Ducklo, the national press secretary for Biden’s presidential campaign, declared in response, according to Axios. Senate Republicans are investigating the Bidens’ activities in Ukraine, particularly Hunter’s business dealings with corrupt Ukrainian energy company Burisma while Joe was serving as vice president. The GOP has pushed back against Democrats’ allegations that they are pursuing the Biden-Burisma probe because White House hopeful Joe has had a resurgence in his quest to become the Democrat party’s presidential nominee.",Donald Trump Jr. Challenges Hunter Biden: ‘Man Up & Debate Me’,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/08/donald-trump-jr-challenges-hunter-biden-man-up-debate-me/,Breitbart
"The Michigan Education Association (MEA) revved up its attacks on President Donald Trump in advance of Tuesday’s presidential primary that pits former Vice President Joe Biden against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on the Democrat side, while the president is essentially unopposed on the Republican side. Last of @MEAOnline “Top Five” Reasons to Vote Tuesday against DeVos/Trump ed agenda – vouchers and for-profit charters. @PaulaMEAPres in the @freep: If Trump and DeVos do this, our public schools will suffer—even more. #Election2020 #FireDeVos #MichEdhttps://t.co/KqVeCjx5pm — MEA Online (@MEAOnline) March 6, 2020  The brazenly partisan political attacks on President Trump by the Michigan teachers’ union is yet further evidence that the #RedforEd movement’s goal is, as Breitbart News first reported in February 2019, to defeat President Trump in 2020: A well-funded and subversive leftist movement of teachers in the United States threatens to tilt the political balance nationwide in the direction of Democrats across the country as Republicans barely hang on in key states that they need to hold for President Donald Trump to win re-election and for Republicans to have a shot at retaking the House and holding onto their Senate majority. This teachers union effort, called #RedforEd, has its roots in the very same socialism that President Trump vowed in his 2019 State of the Union address to stop, and it began in its current form in early 2018 in a far-flung corner of the country before spreading nationally. Its stated goals–higher teacher pay and better education conditions–are overshadowed by a more malevolent political agenda: a leftist Democrat uprising designed to flip purple or red states to blue, using the might of a significant part of the education system as its lever.89 In 2020, 56 million students attend K-12 schools in the United States, according to the Center for Education Reform. Of those, 50.8 million attend public schools, and 3.2 million attend public charter schools. Of the 6.4 million K-12 students who do not attend public schools, 4.8 million attend private schools and 1.6 million are home schooled. In a February op-ed, MEA president Paula Herbart wrote: In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump proposed diverting precious resources from our public schools to failed voucher schemes that drive taxpayer dollars to private schools and wealthy special interests. It’s only the latest gimmick by Trump and anti-public education Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to disinvest in our public schools and the future of our kids. With Devos’ full support, for-profit charter schools continue raking in cash on the backs of our kids and taxpayers. This is nothing short of highway robbery as Michigan’s dedicated public educators continue doing more with less to help all students succeed. Herbart’s attack on charter schools represents the accepted view among most union officials, Democrat candidates, and members of the educational establishment. Both Biden and Sanders oppose vouchers. They also both oppose the expansion of for-profit charter schools. Biden has said he wants to end their expansion, Sanders has called for an end to for-profit charter schools entirely. As the New York Times reported, “for-profit charter schools . . . account for a small proportion of existing charters.” But conservatives point to evidence that charter schools perform well, as Connan Houser noted in this commentary at the Hill in 2017: Two studies were released this month from universities in California that demonstrate the effectiveness of school choice and the need for more options in education. In early October, the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) at Stanford University released a study which followed the educational progress of over 97,000 charter school students in New York over the course of four years. The research concluded that charter school students perform at a level equivalent to receiving an additional 22 days of learning in reading and 63 days in math per year when compared with their public-school counterparts. The results for students attending schools associated with a Charter Management Organization were even greater, adding up to approximately 57 additional days in reading and 103 in math. Charter school minority students, who accounted for 92 percent of the study’s population, tested at a level equal to receiving at least 23 extra days of learning in reading, and 57 days in math when compared to traditional public-school minority students. CREDO was clearly justified in concluding that, for minority students, attending charter schools “indicated a significant academic advantage.” However, this was not the study’s most significant finding. Last week, in the Wall Street Journal, Conor P. Williams, a researcher from the progressive Century Foundation defended charter schools: U.S. charter schools enroll a greater proportion of students of color than traditional public schools and a similar proportion of English-language learners. . . A better debate around charter schools would focus on how well they serve their students. In a Democratic debate last fall, Julián Castro claimed charters perform no better than district schools. One hears this often and it has some empirical grounding, in particular a 2013 Stanford study, which found that students nationwide learn at relatively similar rates in charters and district schools. But charter schools are particularly effective with some historically underserved groups. The Stanford study found they foster greater learning than district schools for English-language learners as well as African-American and Hispanic students living in poverty. And charter-school performance varied widely by state. Charters in Massachusetts performed much better than the state’s traditional public schools, while charters in Nevada performed much worse. The MEA’s attacks on Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary masks the ongoing struggle within the #RedforEd movement. The activist #RedforEd leaders in most states are strongly supportive of Bernie Sanders, as was the case in Minnesota, where one of the heads of the St. Paul Federation of Teachers that recently authorized a strike vote spoke at an election eve Sanders rally, and another serves on the board of an activist group that endorsed Sanders in January. State leaders of teachers unions have been united in their attacks on Trump, but more circumspect when it comes to the choice for the Democratic nomination between Sanders and Biden. In Michigan, the MEA’s Herbart has unabashedly attacked President Trump, as she did in this retweet: Why defeating Trump this fall is absolutely essential—but, alas, not sufficient. It’s going to take enormous work to build/rebuild democracy in the US and around the world. https://t.co/4QiqShGyuH — Sam Bagenstos (@sbagen) March 5, 2020  On the choice between Sanders and Biden, Herbart has been more subtle, as she was in this recent retweet of Sen.

I will do everything in my power to help elect him the next President of the United States. pic.twitter.com/DbB2fGWpaa — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) March 8, 2020  Herbart also retweeted this March 4 tweet from Joe Thomas, head of the Arizona Education Association: When you openly doubt a losing candidate’s supporters will vote for the eventual nominee you are reinforcing that possibility.

Reinforce it until everyone internalizes it as the only option. #2020election — Joe Thomas (@AZ1Thomas) March 4, 2020  One week after Tuesday’s primary in Michigan, attention will turn to primaries in four large states where the #RedforEd movement has been very active since it burst onto the scene two years ago: Arizona, where the #RedforEd movement was launched in March 2018, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio.",Michigan Teachers Union Revs Up #RedforEd Attacks on President Trump Ahead of Primary,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/08/michigan-teachers-union-revs-up-redfored-attacks-president-trump-ahead-primary/,Breitbart
"Representative Jackie Speier (D-CA) complained Sunday on MSNBC that President Donald Trump was putting “his most ardent supporters at risk” by not canceling his upcoming political rallies in light of the current coronavirus outbreak. Speier said, “I don’t think the president is capable of telling us the truth about the coronavirus. And I regret saying that. I think we have to rely on the scientists who are attempting to tell the truth even when they have to contradict the president. ” She added, “The fact that he is not willing to cancel his various rallies suggests that he is willing to place even his most ardent supporters at risk because we’re supposed to stay six feet away from other persons in order to mitigate the exchange of those viruses. I think that he is showing, unfortunately, why he is so ill-prepared to guide our country during this time of the crisis.” Speaking to reporters on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he had no plans to cancel his campaign rallies over concerns about the coronavirus.

"LONDON (AP) – As cases of the coronavirus surge in Italy, Iran, South Korea, the U.S. and elsewhere, many scientists say it’s plain that the world is in the grips of a pandemic — a serious global outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far resisted describing the crisis as such, saying the word “pandemic” might spook the world further and lead some countries to lose hope of containing the virus. “Unless we´re convinced it’s uncontrollable, why [would] we call it a pandemic?” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week. The U.N. health agency has previously described a pandemic as a situation in which a new virus is causing “sustained community-level outbreaks” in at least two world regions. Many experts say that threshold has long been met: The virus that was first identified in China is now spreading freely in four regions, it has reached every continent but Antarctica, and its advance seems unavoidable. The disease has managed to gain a foothold and multiply quickly even in countries with relatively strong public health systems. On Friday, the virus hit a new milestone, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide, far more than those sickened by SARS, MERS or Ebola in recent years.   “I think it’s pretty clear we’re in a pandemic and I don’t know why WHO is resisting that,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Experts acknowledge that declaring a pandemic is politically fraught because it can rattle markets, lead to more drastic travel and trade restrictions and stigmatize people coming from affected regions. WHO was previously criticized for labelling the 2009 swine flu outbreak a pandemic. But experts said calling this crisis a pandemic could also spur countries to prepare for the virus’s eventual arrival. WHO already declared the virus a “global health emergency’ in late January, putting countries and humanitarian organizations on notice and issuing a broad set of recommendations to curb its spread. Even in countries that moved quickly to shut down their links to China, COVID-19 has managed to sneak in. Within a matter of weeks, officials in Italy, Iran and South Korea went from reporting single new cases to hundreds. “We were the first country to stop flights to China and we were completely surprised by this disease,” said Massimo Galli, an infectious-diseases professor at the University of Milan. “It’s dangerous for the entire world that the virus is able to spread underground like this.” With more than 3,800 cases, Italy is the epicentre of Europe’s outbreak and has shut down schools, closed sports stadiums to fans and urged the elderly not to go outside unless absolutely necessary. But it has still exported cases of the virus to at least 10 countries, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Spain, South Africa and Nigeria. Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh who co-chaired a review of WHO’s response to the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, said a pandemic declaration is long overdue. “This outbreak meets all the definitions for a pandemic that we had pre-coronavirus,” she said. At a news conference last month, Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said a pandemic is “a unique situation in which we believe that all citizens on the planet” will likely be exposed to a virus “within a defined period of time.” Several experts said they hadn’t heard that definition. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for its part, defines a pandemic as “an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute´s Department of Science Education.

I will do everything in my power to help elect him the next president of the United States.” An MSNBC producer asked, “Do you think he’ll make another exuberant decision in possibly tapping you as his vice President?” Harris said, “Listen, let me tell you something.

"Fox News’ Howard Kurtz criticized his colleagues for their commentary about Joe Biden’s mental faculties on Sunday’s broadcast of “MediaBuzz.” Kurtz said, “I always criticize liberal commentators for saying things like ‘President Trump is mentally ill’ and ‘President Trump has psychosis, and he’s narcissistic and all that,’ so I do think it was unfortunate that some commentators on Super Tuesday — Brit Hume, Marc Thiessen, people I respect — said Joe Biden is senile or getting there. Certainly, he’s forgetful with his memory lapses, and you can question his performance.” On Super Tuesday, after Biden won the majority of delegates, Brit Hume asked, “How many of the people who voted for him tonight would agree that he’s senile? Or getting there?” Marc Thiessen said, “The reason why Biden is surging is because there is no credible alternatives. It reminds me a lot about Mitt Romney in 2012 when the Republicans were casting around for anybody but Romney because they knew he was weak, they didn’t think he could go against Obama. If he couldn’t defend himself against Newt Gingrich’s attacks on his Bain Capital experience, how was he going to withstand the Obama attacks? There was no other alternative.

"President Donald Trump has decided to skip the annual Congressional St. Patrick’s Day lunch on Capitol Hill, according to Politico‘s Playbook. “Since the Speaker [of the House Nancy Pelosi] has chosen to tear this Nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the President will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity, and will instead celebrate the rich history and strong ties between the United States and Ireland at the White House on March 12,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement. The annual lunch on Capitol Hill takes place around St. Patrick’s Day in addition to a White House meeting with the Prime Minister of Ireland and a White House reception where the Taoiseach traditionally gives the president a bowl of shamrocks. The Congressional luncheon is an ongoing tradition started by House Speaker Tip O’Neill in 1983, who invited President Ronald Reagan to Capitol Hill for the occasion. But the relationship between Trump and Pelosi has deteriorated, particularly after she ripped up the president’s speech at his 2020 State of the Union address. She also removed the words “high privilege” and “distinct honor” for the traditional introduction of the president at Congress at the beginning of his speech.

In early February, the CEO of CEPI, Richard Hatchett, said the group hoped to start clinical testing for a new vaccine in just 16 weeks. “It is increasingly clear that containment measures for COVID-19 can only slow down its spread and the virus is now entering a stage of unprecedented threat in terms of its global impact,” Hatchett said. “It is critical that we … invest in the development of a vaccine that will prevent people from getting sick,” he said. Mr. Hatchett said that the development of a workable vaccine could cost upwards of $2 billion. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are more than 20 potential vaccines in development. The profits for pharmaceutical companies who successfully produce a vaccine could be enormous, The Times noted, as the French drugmaker Sanofi, one of the world’s foremost producers of vaccines, made $2.5 billion selling flu vaccines last year.

Stelter said, “Trump is doing things that undermine the response. He’s continuing to contradict health experts by saying anybody can get a test, which is not true right now. Not true. His behavior at the CDC on Friday spoke volumes about his mindset. He wore a campaign hat to the event. He asked about Fox’s ratings. He insulted the Democratic governor of Washington state and brought up the Ukraine scandal. Most of the news coverage of this visit downplayed just how strange it was. That is a problem. We have to describe reality as it actually is. Not shy away from the abhorrent responses we’re seeing from the commander in chief. Some of his aides are saying this is contained. That’s a lie. Thankfully there’s been fact checks on that point.” He added, “What we need do is prioritize accurate information from experts over misinformation from politicians. Trump and the news media have a tendency to make everything about Trump. But this virus story is only a little bit about Trump. Should he be doing things differently? Yes. For example, the CDC says older Americans should limit travel, but he’s’s not amplifying that message. He should be. Right now. He can tweet about it right now.

Robinson told them: [Law-abiding citizens] want to be able to go the gun show and buy a hunting rifle or a sport rifle. They aren’t military grade weapons sold at a gun show. An AR-15 is not a military grade weapon. Anybody that would go into combat with an AR-15 is full, it’s a semi-automatic .22 rifle. You’d be killed in 15 minutes in combat with that thing. Fox News reports that Robinson won the Republican nomination Tuesday to run for Lt. Governor. Robinson plans to defend the Second Amendment, but he stresses there are other important issues, too. “Our message is so much more than the Second Amendment, which is a crucial issue. It’s a message that touches on all the topics conservative North Carolinians are concerned with today,” Robinson said.

"Beginning March 16, 2020, teachers in Texas’ Santa Fe Independent School District will be able to carry guns on their persons as part of the state’s Guardian Plan. An attacker struck Santa Fe High School on May 18, 2018, killing 10 innocents and wounding numerous others. The Texas Tribune spoke to Flo Rice, a former substitute teacher who was wounded in the attack, and she welcomed the news that teachers will be armed under the Guardian Plan. And she made clear she wishes they had been armed on the morning on the attack, saying, “I understand the other side that does not want more guns in the schools, but I just know from my personal experience and what happened to me, [the Guardian Plan] could have made a difference in the outcome.” Rusty Norman, Santa Fe ISD school board president, addressed the decision to adopt the Guardian Plan, saying: This is not some knee-jerk reaction, this is not something we are taking lightly. We have a school and we have a community that suffered a mass tragedy, and we’ve had to respond accordingly, with things that others may or may not choose to do. The district had the choice of one of two programs–the school marshal program and the Guardian Plan. A key difference between the two is that the marshal plan requires teachers to keep their guns in a locked box, whereas the Guardian Plan allows teachers to carry a gun on persons, at the ready, throughout the day. School board president Norman observed: This is just another layer as a last line of defense, if something gets past all of those other layers and becomes an issue in a classroom or hallway or in one of the school facilities, that someone may be there that could protect themselves along with all the students and staff that are around them. On March 8, 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis signed legislation allowing Florida’s teachers to be armed for classroom defense. That move was the result of the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting, and the legislation DeSantis signed was promoted by Andrew Pollack, father of Parkland shooting victim Meadow Pollack.

"Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) said on Sunday’s broadcast of CBS’s “Face the Nation” that officials had “no concept” of the true scope of the coronavirus outbreak because the Trump administration “didn’t see this coming.” Partial transcript as follows: BRENNAN: We’re back now with Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who is on the Senate committee that oversees healthcare. Connecticut is one of the 33 states with confirmed cases of coronavirus. Senator, it’s good to have you here this morning. And I’m sorry to hear about what’s happening in my home state of Connecticut. How many cases do you think there are right now? There are two that have been reported. MURPHY: Oh, listen, I imagine we have hundreds, if not thousands of cases in my state. I think we have no concept of the scope of this epidemic yet because we have not been able to test. And the fact of the matter is we can’t make good judgments about the measures we should be taking in Seattle or in Danbury or Hartford unless we are able to do these tests. And what is unforgivable is that the administration didn’t see this coming and didn’t put the resources in early to make sure that everybody had these tests available. But we are likely going to have to take much stronger measures as time goes on. But nobody understands where the epidemic is the worst until we get tests widely deployed. BRENNAN: Now, the administration says there are tests in the pipeline. They said about a million were sent out for delivery, arrival on Friday. Are you seeing that in Connecticut? MURPHY: We are not seeing that in Connecticut. We now have private lab capacity to do tests. But our understanding is that we are nowhere near that number that was proffered by the administration last year of a million. We are doing a lot more screening in our state, but we do not have the ability to give a test to everyone who wants one, as the president said was the case on Friday afternoon. And that is incredibly concerning given the fact that we saw this epidemic coming. We could have made a decision back in January or February to accept the WHO test that was available to us or start putting serious resources into developing our own test. The administration did neither and they did neither, because this president has created a culture of misinformation in which no one wants to give him bad news. And that created a disincentive in the White House and in the administration to come up with an early test.

"Former Rep. Donna Edwards (D- MD) called on President Donald Trump to “shut up” about the coronavirus outbreak. Host Chris Wallace asked, “How legitimate do you think it is for Democrats to go after the president on the administration response to the coronavirus?” Edwards said, “I think it’s legitimate to challenge the process and the management of this crisis. It is a public health crisis. I think whenever we hear Dr. Fauci and other experts to talk about this virus and about what to do, and what Americans can do, that it actually is a somewhat reassuring. ” She continued, “What we don’t get is that kind of reassurance coming directly from the president, because of his contradictions, because, you know, the information that he puts out is just not accurate. He would actually, I think, do better in terms of the public if he’d just shut up. Because I don’t think people wouldn’t necessarily blame the president for something that was out of his control, but if he continues in his administration mismanages the crisis, then I think it’s a legitimate point of challenge by anyone who wants to be president saying I would manage it better.” She added, “For example, that Hurricane Katrina and the response had with President Bush. I don’t think this is different in that respect.

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nominee, said Sunday on CNN that she “begrudgingly” gives Breitbart News “a lot of credit” for its ability to shape a narrative. Host Fareed Zakaria said, “There was an article in Vox, and I don’t know if you saw it, on Super Tuesday, on Facebook, the single most searched article —the single searched news topic was Hillary Clinton’s e-mails.” Clinton said, “I’ll tell you what I make of it, is that Fox and the sort of right-wing echo chamber has mastered Facebook, aided and abetted, might I say, by Facebook. So I read that article and what that said to me was here it’s Super Tuesday, the Democrats are trying to decide who they want to nominate against Donald Trump, the Coronavirus is spreading, we now have more and more reports from different places in the country, but led by Fox News and Breitbart and others, it’s going to be about my e-mails. A totally, you know, bogus, finished, nonsense attack on me because they know how not only to drive those stories under the radar screen where the mainstream press like yourself are covering. You know, what’s happening now, but they know how to deliver those stories through the algorithms into the feeds of millions and millions of people.” She added. “So I begrudgingly give them a lot of credit because they are shaping a narrative that is part of the messaging around Trump’s re-election, around people who challenge Trump, changing the subject all of the time.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Hillary Clinton: I ‘Begrudgingly’ Give Breitbart News ‘A Lot of Credit’ for Leading the Narrative,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/08/hillary-clinton-i-begrudgingly-give-breitbart-news-a-lot-of-credit-for-leading-the-narrative/,Breitbart
"Former Vice President Joe Biden is facing backlash over his decades-long support for the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as he campaigns across Michigan ahead of the state’s Democrat primary. Biden, who often touts his support from organized labor on the campaign trail, was met by protesters on Monday at rally in Detroit. As the former vice president was speaking, a number of individuals unfurled two giant banners, one of which read ‘NAFTA killed our jobs.’ The individuals, some of whom identified as union members, began chanting “Biden killed jobs,” forcing the former vice president to pause and address the disruption. “That’s alright, let them go,” Biden said, as supporters and security attempted to pressure the protesters to stand down. “Let them go, this is not a Trump rally. The ‘Bernie Bros’ are here, let them go.” When the crowd subsided and the protesters were escorted out, Biden used the opportunity to take a shot at both President Donald Trump and his rival for the Democrat nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “I’m not worried about it, it’s just a reflection of what’s wrong with American politics today,” the former vice president said. “This is one of the things that Donald Trump has generated, this is not who we are … as a party … or as a people. We have a lot of crazy folks around.” The altercation in Detroit comes as Biden’s long-standing support for free trade takes center stage as the primary contest heads into Michigan. Sanders, who is hoping that a win in the state can restart his flailing presidential campaign, is hammering hard on the issue. In tv ads and on the stump, the Vermont septuagenerian has lambasted Biden for his support of NAFTA and the other free trade agreements, claiming that if Democrats were to nominate someone with such a record, it would essentially mean surrendering the industrial Midwest to Republicans. “Does anybody think that Joe can go to Michigan or Wisconsin or Indiana or Minnesota and say, ‘Vote for me. I voted for those terrible trade deals,” Sanders said during a recent rally. The strategy is one that has worked in the past for the senator. During his 2016 bid for the Democrat presidential nomination, Sanders was able to score upset victories over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by emphasizing his opposition to free trade, specifically then-President Barack Obama’s Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Sanders’ message was particularly potent in Michigan, where the burden of free trade has been most pronounced. Since NAFTA was first implemented in 1994, Michigan lost more than 168,000 manufacturing jobs to countries overseas, most notably Mexico. The impact was felt most heavily by white working-class voters, many of whom lack a college degree. In 2016, such voters overwhelmingly backed Sanders in Michigan’s Democrat primary, handing the senator a narrow victory over Clinton. The results were surprising, not only because Sanders was coming off devastating losses in South Carolina and Super Tuesday, but also because most polls heading into the contest had shown the former secretary of state winning heavily. Sanders ‘victory in Michigan, along with further wins in Wisconsin and Minnesota, foreshadowed the difficulty Clinton would have in keeping such states in the Democrat column in November 2016. Biden, for his part, seems to understand that history and the detriment posed by his support for free trade. Even before the 2020 Democratic field winnowed to a head-to-head matchup with Sanders, the former vice president had already begun distancing himself from his prior stance on the topic. During a Democrat presidential debate in July 2019, Biden admitted that he would not rejoin TPP if elected president. The move was surprising given that the former vice president had once touted the deal’s ability to forge a “new world order” where open markets would force even countries such as China to reform and prosper. Biden built from that reversal at a another debate in August, when he further promised to oppose a “new NAFTA” agreement after being badgered on the issue by rivals. Monday’s protests in Detroit, though, indicate that Biden’s prior championing of free trade is unlikely to be forgotten, especially by supporters of Sanders. Complicating matters for the former vice president is that Trump, himself, appears poised to continue hammering away on the issue if Biden were to become the Democrat nominee. “Joe Biden made a deal, NAFTA,” the president said last week during a campaign rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “He approved it, he was pushing it. It’s the worst trade deal ever made.",Joe Biden Faces Backlash Over NAFTA Support Ahead of Michigan Primary,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/joe-biden-faces-backlash-over-nafta-support-ahead-of-michigan-primary/,Breitbart
"The lawyers representing the mother of a child fathered by Hunter Biden recently filed a motion seeking to have the former vice president’s son held in contempt of court for repeatedly refusing to obey a paternity and child support suit-linked order to provide financial documents, including his 2017 and 2018 personal tax returns. Citing the contempt motion filed in an Arkansas court by 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts’ lawyers on Friday, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette revealed that besides his tax returns, Hunter Biden has also failed to disclose: “All financial institutions used by him or a business he owns or controls;” “a list of all companies he currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated;” “a list of all sources of income for the past five years;” “a list of all employers for the past five years;” tax documents for companies he owns and “a copy of deeds to properties that he owns or in which he has an ownership interest.” “[T]he defendant continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support,” the motion declared, adding, “This Court should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law.” Roberts is a former stripper and the mother of 50-year-old Hunter’s child. Hunter’s conduct is “willful and contemptuous,” Roberts’ lawyers also argued, urging the court to order him to appear in person at a March 13 pretrial hearing to explain why the tribunal should not hold him in contempt, Fox News reported on Sunday. The Arkansas court expects Hunter to appear for a deposition on Wednesday in Little Rock despite his attorney arguing that his client would be unavailable until April 1. Hunter must appear for a deposition before the March 13 hearing, the judge insisted. “After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,” Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee (RNC), told Fox News on Sunday. Citing the results of a DNA test, the Arkansas judge hearing the paternity and child support case ruled in January that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, is the “biological and legal father” of Roberts’ child. According to documents filed in connection to Roberts’ suit, Hunter is the subject of multiple criminal investigations, including a money-laundering probe linked to Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. Hunter served on Burisma’s board of directors for a lucrative $83,000 a month while his father was in charge of U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president, prompting corruption allegations that have triggered investigations by Senate Republicans. The former VP’s son worked for Burisma between 2014 and 2019 despite the conflict of interest and corruption concerns raised by individuals from inside and outside the Obama administration. Hunter has repeatedly defied multiple court orders, refusing to comply with deadlines to provide the financial information. Roberts’ lawyers have reportedly filed three motions to hold Hunter in contempt of the Arkansas court — on March 6, December 23, and January 20. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported on Saturday: In Friday’s Renewed Motion for Contempt and for Order to Show Cause, Roberts’ attorney, Clint Lancaster, said [Hunter] “has continued to flaunt the orders of this Court by failing to answer discovery, comply with court orders, and provide his financial information.” Circuit Judge Don McSpadden, who was initially assigned the case, made clear more than three months ago that Hunter could not withhold certain records. Circuit Judge Holly Meyer replaced McSpadden in January. “He needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire,” Meyer declared during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, the Democrat-Gazette reported. According to the New York Times, Hunter is spending time pursuing a career in art in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in the Hollywood Hills. He is reportedly driving a Porsche. Donald Trump Jr. challenged Hunter over the weekend to a debate, adding that he would release his tax returns if the former vice president’s son makes his public as well.",Contempt Motion by Mother of Hunter Biden’s Child: He ‘Willfully’ Defied Court Order to Provide Documents,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/contempt-motion-hunter-biden-willfully-defied-court-order/,Breitbart
"During an interview aired on Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden stated President Trump has “no competence” on handling the coronavirus and that the market is falling because people don’t trust what the president says. Biden stated, “[T]his gets down to competence and capability. And the — unfortunately, the president has very — no competence in how to handle this crisis.

I mean, there’s no sense of urgency.” Host Lawrence O’Donnell asked, “Do you think the market reaction is a reaction to the markets realizing the president simply does not tell them or the world or this country the truth about this situation, and a market needs clear information?” Biden responded, “I believe that’s the case.

"During a town hall on the Fox News Channel on Monday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said that he doesn’t regret his comments about Fidel Castro and stated that China has reduced extreme poverty, but saying that doesn’t mean he approves of China’s government. Moderator Bret Baier asked, “Do you regret at all saying what you said, at that time, in this race?” Sanders responded, “No. Look, I have spent my entire life fighting for working people and fighting for democracy. And, Bret, if you check my record, I have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is in the Soviet Union, whether it’s in Cuba, whether it is in Saudi Arabia. … Whether it’s the United Arab Emirates, wherever it may be. I happen to be old-fashioned, and I believe in democracy. So, if you look at a country like China, for example, today, is China a democracy? Of course it’s not a democracy. It is an authoritarian country. And Xi is taking it in a bad direction. But what can we say about China in the last 50 years? Would anybody in their right mind deny that extreme poverty in China has been reduced? Can anyone deny that? Of course not. Does that mean we approve of the Chinese government? No, it doesn’t.” He continued, “But I think, sometimes — and I know it’s hard given — not you — given the media that we deal with and everything else, you say something, and people can beat up on you. I think you’ve got to tell the truth. So, if, in China, they have reduced extreme poverty, does that make me a communist who supports China?

"Scott Presler, the man who launched the clean up American cities movement last summer after President Donald Trump spotlighted the blight in Democrat-controlled Baltimore, continued his work over the weekend helping tornado victims in Tennessee. But he also told Breitbart News that in cities across the country, it is illegal immigrants getting benefits while homeless Americans are living on the streets. Presler told Breitbart News that he felt compelled to use his large network of volunteers to lend a hand in the cleanup effort in Tennessee following a tornado that devastated parts of the state and killed at least 25 people. “We had over 100 volunteers. The majority were from Nashville, but some even came from Knoxville, Tennessee. One drove ten hours from Dallas in her car, and some even came from Atlanta, Georgia,” Presler told Breitbart News. “We filled half of a truck full of items that we donated to a Baptist church including things like water or non-perishable food hygiene products, baby wipes,” Presler said. “And then after we were done donating the items, we sent out teams of volunteers to help clean up debris.” The real heroes, in addition to the volunteers, were Jami & her amazing team,  who donated 100 meals!  Make sure to follow @TNCobblerCo & support these good-hearted people. #NashvilleStrong pic.twitter.com/ztiAm20K1i — #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) March 9, 2020  But what has struck Presler over the course of his mission is how illegal immigrants are being prioritized in U.S. cities while Americans are living on the streets. Presler spoke about this issue recently at the 2020 CPAC convention in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Besides picking up trash, your heart is drawn to homeless people,” Breitbart News said in the interview. “And you don’t just pick up trash around them, but you like to engage with them. Why do you want to do that?” “I want to give them hope,” Presler said. “These are cities that I’m going to that have been neglected for decades where these people truly are hopeless.” “And so I want to go in there as just a shot of energy — a shot of this ‘can do’ attitude and ‘can do’ spirit,” Presler said. He said he met a young man living on the streets of San Francisco who had a daughter and a job, ironically, picking up trash, but lived in a tent on the streets. Presler asked him how he felt about illegal immigrants getting benefits. “And he said, ‘I’m angry.’ He said, ‘What about us? We should have priority. We were here first.’” “So, in dealing with the homeless community, especially, I’m not only really careful to respect their humanity because they are — they’re human beings,” Presler said, “but I want to change the stigma because so many people think the homeless community are lazy, which is wrong.” Presler said he met a man in Los Angeles who worked in the movie business but still lived on the streets. “These are people that either they [face] hard times or they can’t afford housing, but these are smart, intellectual people, and I just think it’s wrong that illegal immigrants come first but we don’t take care of our people,” Presler said. Presler plans more cleanups on March 14 in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia on April 4. His crew will visit Detroit on May 2, and he also hopes to host a cleanup during the Democrat nominating conference in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

"Lenard “Charlamagne tha God” McKelvey criticized former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday for not appearing on The Breakfast Club radio broadcast. McKelvey told MSNBC’s Craig Melvin that the Democrat frontrunner owes his “political life” to black supporters and that his campaign “would be dead” without them. And while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg have all appeared to speak to black voters through his nationally syndicated radio show, Biden has been conspicuously absent. Asked why he thinks that might be, McKelvey was stumped: “I have no idea,” he answered. “It goes back to what I said: Joe Biden owes black people his political life. You know what I’m saying? So don’t disrespect that base by not showing up, especially when, you know, all your other former opponents did,” he said. McKelvey also claimed that sources have told him that the decision may have something to do with Biden’s campaign advisers. “I definitely got it on great authority that a lot of the black surrogates around him don’t want him to come on ‘The Breakfast Club’ for whatever reason,” he said. “Black people saved his life the past couple of weeks,” McKelvey concluded. “His campaign would be dead if it wasn’t for our O.G. Jim Clyburn in South Carolina endorsing him, and all those black voters in the South going out and voting for him,” McKelvey concluded. “Plus, you were the vice president for the first black president.

"A convicted felon who became one of the faces of the “First Step Act” law after his release from prison last year has since been re-arrested for allegedly trafficking meth in North Carolina. Troy Powell stood behind President Donald Trump at last year’s White House ceremony celebrating the passage of the First Step Act, which has released at least 3,100 convicted felons from federal prison including at least 59 convicted killers and assailants, 239 convicted sex offenders, 960 inmates with drug convictions, 106 convicted robbers, 496 inmates with weapons and explosives convictions. At the ceremony, Powell thanked Republican and Democrat lawmakers for their passage of the law, suggesting that there be a “second step” that releases more federal inmates. Powell had been serving a 20-year federal sentence for a 2004 drug offense. “I’d like to say thank you to everybody here on Capitol Hill for finally getting this bill pushed through … there’s more that can be done. I left so many people behind in prison doing 40 and 50 years for nothing. I mean absolutely nothing,” Powell said. “I think there should be a second step.” About a year after his release, Powell has been arrested for his alleged part in a meth trafficking ring in Caldwell County, North Carolina, as WSOCTV.com reported. Powell was charged with possession of meth, intent to sell meth, and conspiracy after police said he and three other men were in possession of thousands of dollars worth of meth. Powell is the latest felon released by the First Step Act to be re-arrested for additional crimes. Last year, Breitbart News chronicled the case of 41-year-old Joel Francisco, a notorious leader of the “Almighty Latin Kings” gang, who was freed by the First Step Act and arrested months later for allegedly murdering 46-year-old Troy Pine. Francisco was originally convicted in 2005 for dealing crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Days after his release by the First Step Act in February 2019, drug records reveal he immediately returned to using cocaine. As Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz noted, the number of felons who have been re-arrested since their release from prison by the First Step Act is not counted. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) pushed to include a provision that would have made public the felons who went on to commit additional crimes after their release and which would have notified victims of the felon’s release from prison. Kennedy’s provision, though, was tanked by 15 Senate Republicans who joined every Senate Democrat to vote the measure down. Those Senate Republicans who voted against the victim-protection measure include Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Bob Corker (R-TN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Dean Heller (R-NV), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Todd Young (R-IN).

"Monday during an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) pushed back against the suggestion Congress should be canceled because of the threat of the spread of the coronavirus. Brooks told WVNN’s “The Dale Jackson Show” that such a gesture would send the “wrong message,” adding he was aware of the CPAC situation. “Last night, I had communication with my staff that we may cancel Congress for some period of time,” Brooks said. “We also have Senator Ted Cruz and [Rep.] Paul Gosar, representative from Arizona, quarantined, closed their offices. Ten days ago, I was at a CPAC event where I spoke — two different segments of it. And apparently, there was a guy there with coronavirus, and then staffers from CPAC may have got it — staffers that I may have interacted with. Now, I’m feeling fine. But the idea that we should cancel Congress — I think that sends entirely the wrong message out.

"Rep. Jim Jordan’s (R-OH) office hit back at CNN on Monday after the outlet repackaged old allegations against him in a new story last week: He knew about alleged sexual misconduct by the wrestling team’s doctor while was a coach at Ohio State University. “Congressman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it,” said Jordan’s Communications Director Ian Fury in a statement. CNN published a piece on Friday, after Ohio State University (OSU) announced it had reached a settlement with 11 of the doctor’s victims in 18 pending cases. The piece cited six former student wrestlers who claimed they were present when Jordan “heard or responded to sexual misconduct complaints about team doctor Richard Strauss.” A senior Republican source close to Jordan blasted CNN for the report, which cites claims from some former wrestlers who have criminal records and are seeking monetary settlements from OSU. The source said in a statement: CNN was wrong about Russian collusion. CNN was wrong about Ukraine. CNN is now wrong about Jim Jordan. Ask anyone that knows him, but the idea that Congressman Jordan did anything wrong is ludicrous and CNN should be ashamed for even thinking otherwise. There is no evidence that Jordan knew of any abuse or complaints about the abuse when he served as assistant coach at OSU from 1987 to 1995. Strauss was the team doctor between 1979 and 1998. The doctor committed suicide in 2005. An investigation by law firm Perkins Coie for OSU said Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male student-patients during his time at OSU. The report does not say coaches were aware of the abuse, but that 22 unnamed coaches were “aware of rumors or complaints.” According to CNN, since that report, more former student wrestlers have come forward to testify about Strauss, and the Ohio House of Representatives is considering a bill that would lift the statute of limitations for victims to come forward and sue OSU. Jordan told CNN that those athletes accusing him of knowing about any abuse and not doing anything about it are not telling the truth. “I feel sorry for these guys, the fact that they aren’t telling the truth. I mean these are guys I trained with, these are guys I worked out with, I ran with, wrestled with, and the idea that now they are saying what they are, it’s just not true.” Jordan also noted that the investigation by Perkins Coie — the Democrat-linked law firm that hired Fusion GPS to produce the dossier claiming that candidate Donald Trump colluded with Russia — never mentioned his name. “What they’re saying is just not true,” he said. Dunyasha Yetts, one former wrestler, told CNN he complained to Jordan and then-head coach Russ Hellickson in 1992 after Strauss groped him during his initial physical exam, and again in 1993 when he injured his thumb and Strauss tried to remove his shorts. Yetts said he complained to Jordan and Jordan said something like, “If he tried that on me, I would kill him.” Yetts was the first one to claim that Jordan was aware of the abuse. He is suing OSU, and his case is not among those that were settled last week. Yetts served 18 months in prison starting in 2007 for a fraudulent investment scheme he ran between 1998 and 2001, where he lied to clients to obtain millions of dollars he used to pay back debts and for his lifestyle, according to UPI. His victims included Minnesota Vikings cornerback and OSU football player Antoine Winfield. He served another 60-day jail sentence and two more years of probation for violating rules while on probation, according to the report. Another former wrestler CNN cited was Adam DiSabato, who told Ohio state legislators in February that Jordan had called him in 2018 asking him to contradict statements his brother had made about Jordan knowing of Strauss’s abuse. “Jim Jordan called me crying, crying. Groveling. On the 4th of July, begging me to go against my brother. Begging me. Crying for a half hour. That’s the kind of cover-ups that’s going on there,” DiSabato told state legislators. DiSabato appeared at a protest last week with Melissa Ackison, a Republican running for the Ohio State Senate against opponent Ohio Rep. Bill Reineke (R), who is endorsed by Jordan. CNN said a “handful” who spoke to them had no knowledge of Jordan hearing about the abuse. At least two of them described Jordan as a supportive coach, and one said there is no way Jordan would not have intervened had he known about the abuse. “I would guess that, realistically, if you’re on the coaching staff you would know something about it, but whether they heard specifics and were more directly involved, that’s another question,” said Rick Burlenski. Another former wrestler, Mike Alf, who was at OSU between 1988 and 1992, said, “I know Jim Jordan… . He would do anything to protect us.” Then-head coach Hellickson told CNN in 2018 that he had a talk with Strauss about his physical contact with wrestlers and them being uncomfortable showering with him. He said Jordan may not have known about the alleged abuse. Numerous other former wrestlers and coaches have defended Jordan against knowing about any abuse. Their statements have been compiled into one website by the Jordan campaign, as noted by CNN.   Follow Breitbart News’ Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Jim Jordan’s Office Hits Back Against CNN Report He Knew About Doctor’s Sex Abuse: ‘Ludicrous’,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/jim-jordans-office-hits-back-against-cnn-report-he-knew-about-doctors-sex-abuse-ludicrous/,Breitbart
"Coronavirus task force expert Dr. Anthony Fauci claimed on Sunday that roughly four million test kits will be available by the end of next week. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted to “some missteps” by the administration in providing vital testing resources. “Early on, there were some missteps with regard to the test and some technical aspects to it,” Fauci said. “But right now, I believe, 1.1 million tests have already been sent out. By Monday, there’ll be an additional 400,000. And by the end of next week, probably around 4 million.” Fauci also said officials are getting a “better sense” of the magnitude of the coronavirus outbreak as the situation continues to escalate. “Unfortunately,” he said, “that ‘better sense’ is not encouraging, because we’re seeing community spread.” He then advised caution, especially for those in the most vulnerable populations. “If you’re a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, you need to think twice about getting on a plane, on a long trip,” he warned. “And not only think twice. Just don’t get on a cruise ship.” The Trump administration continues to face widespread criticism for its response to the global pandemic. As countries like Israel, Italy, and South Korea struggle to contain major outbreaks, the U.S. continues to lag behind in testing its population. Despite this, coronavirus has been officially confirmed in most states. President Donald Trump continues to downplay the pandemic, blaming the “Black Monday” stock market crash on coronavirus “fake news.” Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence continues to lead the public response. The conflicting messages have created the impression of a divide between the two leaders, though Pence has remained supportive of the POTUS. “President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the American people,” Pence said on Saturday. “It’s the reason why, from the first advent of the coronavirus in America, the president launched a whole of government approach, but as evidenced here today it’s not just a whole of government approach … but it’s really a whole of America approach.”",White House Expert Says 4 Million Coronavirus Tests Available Next Week,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/white-house-expert-says-4-million-coronavirus-tests-available-next-week/,Breitbart
"The White House announced Monday that President Donald Trump has not been tested for coronavirus. “The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients nor does he have any symptoms,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to reporters on Monday. Grisham cited the Centers for Disease Control guidelines, asking medical professionals to base their testing decisions on patient symptoms and exposure history. “President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,” Grisham said in her statement. Trump spent the weekend traveling with Rep. Matt Gaetz, who after returning to Washington, DC, aboard Air Force One admitted that he had contact with a CPAC attendee who tested positive for the disease. Gaetz announced that he would put himself in self-quarantine as a precaution. Three additional members of Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) also announced their decision to self-quarantine after learning they had contact with the individual infected with the virus. Incoming White House Chief of Staff and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) revealed on Monday night that he would also self-quarantine, as he might have been exposed to someone with the virus. Meadows took a test for the virus, which came back negative.

"A bill in the Wyoming legislation to criminalize the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) on minors that has bipartisan support is being slammed by transgender activists who claim it discriminates against those who might want surgery to alter their biological sex. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that as many as 200 million girls and women around the world are living with the harmful effects of FMG, which can include chronic pain, recurring infections, incontinence, sexual problems, and complications of pregnancy and labor that increase risk of death to the infant. Both Republicans and Democrats in the state are backing HBO127, which “defines FGM; classifies FGM as aggravated assault and battery; requires convictions of FGM be included on the child abuse registry; prohibits licensure of health care professionals who perform the procedure; mandates FGM be reported as child abuse; provides an avenue for victims of the procedure to recover damages; and calls for establishment of a community education program,” according to an online site focused on “gender identity.” “The site reported on opposition to the bill, citing Tara Muir, policy director of the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault (WCADVSA), has slammed the legislation as having the potential to place ‘draconian limits on transgender people.’”  The bill defines and describes FMG, according to the article:  “Female genital mutilation” includes the partial or total removal of the clitoris, prepuce, labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora, the narrowing of the vaginal opening such as through the creation of a covering seal formed by cutting and repositioning the inner or outer labia, with or without removal of the clitoris, any harmful procedure to the genitalia, including pricking, piercing, incising, scraping or cauterizing or any other actions intended to alter the structure or function of the female genitalia for non-medical reasons. HB0127 – Prohibition of female genital mutilation HBO 127 specifies that “sex reassignment surgery” is not prohibited “if the person on whom it is performed is over eighteen (18) years of age and requests and consents to the procedure.”  Although both Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that it is already “rare” for a doctor to allow a person under 18 to undergo gender-affirming surgeries, transgender activists are crying foul. Representative Sara Burlingame (D-Cheyenne) protested the language of the sex-reassignment clause as “bog[ging] this bill down with something that’s going to stop it in its tracks,” while Tara Muir of WCADVSA complained, “Wyoming cannot be the first state with such draconian limits on transgender people.”  Some discussion of the bill on social media included tweets about Renee Bergstrom, who faced FGM as a child in a religious cult. Tweets claimed Bergstrom’s use of the expression “female genital mutilation” is “transgender-exclusionary language, as not all people with vaginas are women, and not all women have vaginas.” ""Tweeters said Ms Bergstrom’s use of the phrase 'female genital mutilation' is transgender-exclusionary language.""

"MSNBC host Rachel Maddow on her Monday broadcast accused President Donald Trump of being “willing to lie to the people about things that will keep them alive,” referring to the coronavirus outbreak. Reading from an Associated Press report, Maddow said, “As bungled, is that the right word? That’s the nice word for it. As bungled as the response has been from our federal government, this is actually a problem of a different kind. And this is, this is the thing that I’ve sort of most been worried about. And it is apparently come to pass. Quote, ‘The White House overruled health officials who wanted to recommend that elderly and physically fragile Americans be advised not to fly on commercial airlines because of the new coronavirus.’ Quote, ‘The Centers for Disease Control submitted the plan as a way to control the virus, but White House officials ordered the air travel recommendation be removed,’ said one official who had direct knowledge of the plan.” She continued, “The Trump administration officials have since suggested that certain people should consider not traveling, but they’ve stopped short of the stronger guidance that was sought by the CDC. Quote ‘The person who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity did not have authorization to talk about this matter.’ So if this Associated Press report is correct, the Centers for Disease Control concluded internally, in what was presumably a science-driven process, that not just people with underlying health conditions, not just people with other health challenge, but all older Americans, should not fly. That was the CDC’s reported conclusion about the advice Americans should be given in the context of this virus, in order to keep ourselves safe and alive. Older Americans don’t get on planes.” She added, “If the best expert advice from the Centers for Disease Control says that all older Americans should not fly, and the White House has spiked that advice, for whatever reason, and so individual officials have to leak it, in order to let the American people know that’s the advice, this is an important moment in this crisis, right?

"Nicholas Pirelli pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the alleged rape of a student in his campus office whom he met online. 36-year-old Bridgewater State University communications professor Nicholas Pirelli stands accused of the rape of an unidentified student he met online through a “sugar daddy” matching site. According to police reports, Pirelli allegedly met with the young woman after offering to help her with an essay as well as her resume. Pirelli also allegedly offered to use his “connections as a professor” to get her work on the Massachusetts campus. After inviting her to a meeting in his office, Pirelli is said to have assisted the student with her essay for all of 30 minutes before abruptly kissing her. As she resisted, Pirelli allegedly forcibly removed her clothing and sexually assaulted her for approximately ten minutes. Afterward, he reportedly told her “good night” and left. “When interviewing the victim, several times she broke down and began crying,” the report says, concluding that “detectives found the victim credible throughout their interviews with her.” Previously, Pirelli allegedly asked for the student’s discretion — as well as “risky” pictures. He also took pictures of his own sex toy collection. Investigators found a “large cache” of communications between the two, some of which occurred after her alleged rape and “appeared to indicate from their tone” that the victim “may have found Pirelli’s actions acceptable to her.” She explained that the communications were “part of an effort to appease him,” police said, “in an attempt to ‘let him down easy’ and so as not to ruin her chances of obtaining employment through the university.” It is important to note that maintaining contact with the abuser is common after sexual assault and does not indicate the innocence of the accused. As with the promise of employment or influence, abusers often deliberately create a situation in which the cessation of contact will have devastating implied consequences — the most notable example being billionaire movie mogul and convicted sexual predator Harvey Weinstein. Despite the evidence at hand, Pirelli has denied any “physical encounters” in his office with the woman. According to the police report, “when confronted with the report of inappropriate touching, Pirelli stated, ‘That is extreme,’ and stated that he did nothing wrong.” Bridgewater State University has released a statement saying it “has zero tolerance for misconduct, abuse, or violence against any members of our campus community and is committed to preventing and holding accountable anyone responsible for acts of physical and sexual assault,” assuring the public it is “working closely with the district attorney’s office in their prosecution of this alleged crime.”",Massachusetts Professor Charged with Raping Student After Meeting Online,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/massachusetts-charged-raping-student-meeting-online/,Breitbart
"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is changing its debate format to limit the rigorous standing required by candidates, at a time when there is renewed scrutiny over former Vice President Joe Biden’s fitness for the White House. The DNC announced on Friday that the format for its next debate, to be held in Arizona on March 15, would have the candidates seated behind a desk, fielding questions from the audience. The format change, which was first reported by Politico, would be a departure from the past ten debates, where candidates stood behind lecterns and faced questions from moderators. “After ten debates, the DNC worked with its network partners to adapt the March debate to the smaller field of candidates and to give voters more of a voice,” a DNC spokeswoman said in announcing the new format. The change occurs as the Democrat field has winnowed, leaving Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as the only two viable candidates for the nomination. That process, which saw establishment Democrats consolidate behind the former vice president ahead of Super Tuesday, has left many Sanders supporters feeling as though the primary is being manipulated to thwart their candidate. Sanders, himself, granted credence to such thinking during a weekend appearance on ABC’s This Week. Sanders said, while discussing machinations that led to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Pete Buttigieg to dropping out and backing the former vice president: What was very clear from the media narrative and what the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and defeat me. We’re taking on the establishment… the corporate establishment … the political establishment. Given such feelings, it is no surprise that many on the left believe the DNC’s debate format change is meant to benefit Biden—a claim the former vice president’s team denies. The sentiment was best summed up by Glenn Greenwald, who took to social media shortly after the new format was announced to lambast what he saw as a transparent effort by the DNC to “protect” the former vice president. “What is Biden going to do if he’s the nominee and he doesn’t have the rotted DNC to protect him by corruptly changing the rules that let him basically lounge around in a bed taking questions from nice people instead of having to stand on his feet and directly debate,” Greenwald wrote. What is Biden going to do if he’s the nominee and he doesn’t have the rotted DNC to protect him by corruptly changing the rules that let him basically lounge around in a bed taking questions from nice people instead of having to stand on his feet and directly debate? https://t.co/W8Elnn98eO — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) March 8, 2020  Others were just as cutting in their criticism of the DNC’s decision. The DNC changed the debate rules not only to exclude Tulsi but to let the candidates sit down. And now the audience will ask questions instead of moderators. I have zero doubt that questions will be planted. It's so obvious that they're trying to protect Joe. — Secular Talk (@KyleKulinski) March 8, 2020  DNC has suddenly changed its debate rules AGAIN: Bernie & Biden will sit & take questions from audience, rather than stand for a moderated debate. In short: it's not a debate. This will only fuel concerns about Biden's cognitive decline & his ability to debate Trump this fall. https://t.co/wqexNADB6d — Dr. Jill Stein🌻 (@DrJillStein) March 9, 2020  Adding to suspicions about the DNC’s motives is that the format change comes as Biden faces renewed scrutiny about his fitness to be commander in chief. Although the 77-year-old former vice president has long been known for his gaffes and lapses, many Democrats now worry that such instances will only fuel speculation about his cognitive health—potentially damaging his chances in the general election. This was exhibited last week, most notably when Biden bungled a quote from the Declaration of Independence during a campaign swing through Texas. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created by, go, you know, you know the thing,” the former vice president said, visibly struggling to remember the famous line. That moment was quickly eclipsed by the former vice president urging voters to show up and support his campaign on “Super Thursday.” The back-to-back verbal missteps, followed up by Biden confusing his wife and sister during a speech in California, led even some senior Democrats to confess the former vice president’s cognitive health was an issue. “He is a candidate that is mentally deteriorating. People in the Democratic establishment say, ‘Oh don’t say that.’ They really believe that they can shield Joe Biden from public scrutiny and the reality is, they can’t,” Justin Horwtiz, a Democratic strategist and Sanders supporter, admitted during an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight.",DNC Changes Debate Rules to Allow Candidates to Sit as Questions Mount Over Biden’s Fitness,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/dnc-changes-debate-rules-to-allow-candidates-to-sit-as-questions-mount-over-bidens-fitness/,Breitbart
"During a town hall on the Fox News Channel on Monday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stated that he wouldn’t “go at that level” by attacking fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden’s mental acuity and “that’s for people to decide.” Moderator Bret Baier said, “[T]he question of Joe Biden’s mental acuity is not something that just comes up anywhere” before playing clips of Democrats raising the issue. Sanders responded, “I’m not going to go at that level in attacking. Joe and I have — you know, that’s for people to decide. All I can say is, Joe and I have very significant political differences. And I’m not going to be making personal attacks on Joe. That’s not what I do.” Earlier, Sanders cited a speech that Biden gave that only lasted seven minutes, stating, “I don’t know how you say anything, other than minimal discussion in seven minutes.” Sanders later denied that he was suggesting Biden lacked substance, but added, “If I’m going to give a speech to people…I can’t do it in seven minutes. You know, there are too many issues. There’s health care, education, climate change, immigration reform, criminal justice reform. I don’t know how you do that in seven minutes.

"A survey conducted by the Job Creators Network (JCN) showed that small business owners — employers with less than 500 employees — found that 79.4 percent want free market-based healthcare as opposed to Medicare for All or a Public Option. JNC also asked the 703 local business owners how they think the Trump administration has handled economic issues; 66 percent of the small business owners responded with “good” or “great.” “When asked who they would vote for if the election was held tomorrow and the Democratic candidate was Joe Biden, more than 73 percent said they would vote for Donald Trump,” the survey said. That number jumped to 77 percent who said they would vote to re-elect President Trump if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was the Democratic candidate. “The results speak for themselves: small business owners are thriving and attribute much of their continued success to the pro-growth policies pushed by the current administration,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, in a press release. “Additionally, the support for free market healthcare reform aligns with recent efforts of the Job Creators Network Foundation and Physicians for Reform,” Ortiz said. “The Healthcare for You framework aims to inject choice and competition into the healthcare market–giving Americans the decision-making power they want and deserve. Entrepreneurs don’t want a progressive or socialist playing puppet master with businesses and the economy. The free market should be doing the heavy lifting.” When asked what the top three areas of concern are for them, 56.7 percent of the group of small business owners said high taxes, another 39.8 percent said healthcare, and 37.6 said the Coronavirus concerns them.

"Two pediatricians say data from a study published at the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) actually reveals the opposite of what its authors conclude – that puberty blockers are linked to positive mental health outcomes in youth claiming to be transgender. In the February issue of Pediatrics, Drs. Jack L. Turban, Dana King, Jeremi M. Carswell, and Alex S. Keuroghlian, asserted that “pubertal suppression for transgender adolescents who want this treatment is associated with favorable mental health outcomes.” “There is a significant inverse association between treatment with pubertal suppression during adolescence and lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who ever wanted this treatment,” the authors concluded from their data. Two pediatricians, however, both board members of the American College of Pediatricians, which has posted a position statement on child gender dysphoria and the consequences of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatments, said the data actually reveal the opposite of what Turban and his associates claim. “Given the controversy surrounding the practice of puberty suppression for gender dysphoric adolescents, the article by Turban et al creates more confusion than clarity,” wrote Drs. Scott Field and Den Trumbull in a comment responding to the journal article. The authors of the study used a cross-sectional survey of 20,619 transgender adults between the ages of 18 and 36. They examined the adults’ self-reported history of puberty blocking drugs during adolescence and then studied “associations between access to pubertal suppression and adult mental health outcomes, including multiple measures of suicidality.” The researchers found that 90 percent of the transgender adults who wanted, but were unable to obtain, puberty blockers experienced suicidal thoughts. However, 75 percent of transgender adults who received puberty blocking drugs experienced the same suicidal thoughts. Turban and his colleagues reported 16.9 percent of those adults surveyed self-reported they “ever wanted” to take puberty blockers. Of these participants, 2.5 percent received the drugs. The authors concluded: After adjustment for demographic variables and level of family support for gender identity, those who received treatment with pubertal suppression, when compared with those who wanted pubertal suppression but did not receive it, had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation. In examining the data, however, Field and Trumbull addressed several problems with the study: The authors imply causal evidence for a reduction in suicidal ideation with transgender adolescents who received puberty suppression (PS), yet they fail to acknowledge the exceedingly high rates in both groups of suicide ideation (75% and 90%) and suicide attempts (42% and 51%). The pediatricians observed flaws in the design of Turban et al’s study: The cross-sectional design using online survey data is insufficient to validate the efficacy of such a life-altering therapy. Because the data was collected by survey, there is no way of knowing how many would-be participants in either group actually succumbed to suicide. The so-called “lifetime suicidal ideation” is misleading, since at the time of the survey, the PS treatment group was significantly (p=001) younger (mean age 21.7 years) than the “ever wanted” PS control group (mean age 23.4 years), and the total age range of survey participants was 18 to 36 years. With mean age of hormone treatment initiation being 15.7 years in the PS group and 22.5 in the control group (p<0.001), it is obvious that the follow-up time for both groups was far too brief to assess “lifetime suicidal ideation.” The control group was not appropriately matched to the treatment group by age at time of survey or by age when hormone therapy was begun. Since there were over 30 controls for each PS case, they could have been selectively trimmed to be better matched. Field and Trumbull then noted the outcome is actually the opposite of what the authors claim: What is more disturbing is that the PS treated group actually had double (45.5% versus 22.8%) the rates of the control group for serious (resulting in inpatient care) suicide attempts in the year preceding the data collection. The pediatricians identified another study that found adolescents who identify as transgender, as well as those who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual, are increasing at “extraordinary rates,” specifically, doubled between 2009 and 2017. “[T]hese adolescents are almost four times more likely than their heterosexual peers to commit suicide,” Field and Trumbull noted. “The same study found that over 35% of adolescent suicide attempts in 2017 came from sexual minorities, who comprised only 14% of the adolescent population.” According to the pediatricians, there are no long-term studies proving puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or “gender-confirming surgery” are either safe or effective. They added these treatments “potentially render recipients sterile, physically altered, and sexually dysfunctional,” and, therefore, should be considered “experimental” until longitudinal studies can prove otherwise. “The prevailing narrative that these interventions are necessary to prevent suicide is without reasonable evidence,” Field and Trumbull asserted. Turban said in January that his findings add to the “growing evidence base suggesting that gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth is associated with superior mental health outcomes in adulthood,” reported NBC News. “It certainly argues against the misguided notion that gender-affirming care is inherently harmful and should be legislatively banned,” he added, apparently referring to several bills introduced in states attempting to ban transgender drugs and surgeries for children. Turban is a psychiatrist who was nominated for NBC Out’s #Pride30 list by producer Andy Cohen, who praised the psychiatrist’s efforts to “bring the stories of transgender youth to the general public” and “build empathy and support” for the trans community. “I’m a cisgender, gay white man,” Turban told NBC Out. “I recognize my privilege. We’ve made so much progress in LGB health, but the T was left behind.” Turban’s co-authors, King and Keuroghlian, are affiliated with the Fenway Institute, an interdisciplinary center for research, training, education, and policy development regarding LGBT individuals.",Pediatricians Say Study Approving Puberty Blockers for Adolescents Is Flawed,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/pediatricians-say-study-approving-puberty-blockers-for-adolescents-is-flawed/,Breitbart
"U.S. Senate Finance Committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) told Breitbart News exclusively that his plan to reform prescription drug pricing would specifically focus on reining in federal taxpayer spending on drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid plans. “The bill would basically reform a lot of federal spending on health care, particularly through Medicare, Medicaid,” Grassley said in an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel about his bipartisan Senate prescription drug plan with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). “We would reduce subsidies from Medicare to the pharmaceuticals. We would put a year-over-year cap on price increases at the rate of inflation. We would put a big cap on the amount of money that one consumer would have to spend out-of-pocket. It would save the taxpayers about 80 billion dollars. It would take some of the secrecy out of the pricing of drugs. It would take some of the secrecy out of the middle man that we call a pharmaceutical benefits managers (PBMs), because all that secrecy keeps the marketplace from working, and more transparency would enhance competition. And with the more transparency you get more accountability, and we don’t have that accountability today. It would do away with the donut hole that I won’t explain, but it’s been a controversial part of Part D since it was established in 2003. But the main thing is it would cause the marketplace to work. It would stop subsidies to Big Pharma. Well, not stop subsidies, but it would limit the subsidies, because presently there’s no limit on how much they can increase drug prices – this year five to ten percent – and it ought to be limited to the inflation rate. So that’s a broad summary. It does a lot more than what I just told you.” Grassley’s bipartisan bill rivals a partisan House bill from Speaker Nancy Pelosi that only has Democrat support in the House. When asked to describe the difference between the plans, Grassley cited the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which laid out how his bill would not adversely affect innovation of new treatments and cures of diseases and also would have a positive impact on prescription drug prices for patients not using Medicare or Medicaid—in other words, not using taxpayer funds—to cover the costs of their prescriptions. Pelosi’s bill does not get the same ratings, and Grassley said hers would “interfere” with “the practice of medicine.” “You would say that hers gets all sorts of drugs, but you mention the idea with Medicare and Medicaid – but don’t forget, so much that the government sets a policy that carries over to the private sector,” Grassley said. “So the Congressional Budget Office says that my bill would also cut down on a non-Medicare people, consumers purchasing drugs. It would also not hurt innovation — I’m quoting Congressional Budget Office — it wouldn’t hurt innovation like hers hurts innovation. But she would take the heavy-handed approach of, instead of the marketplace working, having the government-set prices, which would basically reduce the amount of pills that are in a formulary, so that the government would be getting between you and your doctor and what the doctor might want to prescribe. We don’t want to interfere with the practice of medicine. I think her bill would. It would for sure reduce the formulary, because it follows the pattern of the VA Administration, Veterans Administration, where they dictate prices and the formularies [to] about two-thirds of what you get under Medicare, where there’s market and consumer choice, and doctor prescriptions are making the decision what you ought to take as a pill.” Asked again about the innovation claim—critics of Grassley’s efforts sometimes say that such moves may harm efforts by pharmaceutical companies to develop more effective treatments or even cures to significant diseases. Grassley pointed again to CBO, which said his plan would not hurt innovation in any way. “This may be too short of answer, but since I’m in politics, I always like to quote professional people, and so the Congressional Budget Office—even though it’s an arm of Congress they’re professional people—and they said our bill does not hurt innovation in any way and they say just the opposite about the Pelosi bill, and then you also got to remember from a political standpoint the Grassley-Wyden bill. Wyden is the Democrat helping me and he’s from Oregon and he’s the ranking member on the committee,” Grassley said. “We have the only bipartisan bill that is going to get 60 votes in the United States Senate, so you could lie to progressives like the Pelosi bill, but it would never get through the United States Senate. We’ve got a bipartisan bill that can become law and do what the president—actually the president was six months ahead of Congress by June of 2018 giving a major speech in this area and doing through regulation what he wanted to accomplish to get drug prices down. Our bill works in conjunction with what the president’s trying to do and we’ve only got the only bill that can get 60 votes in the Senate.” On the political side of this, several GOP senators up for re-election in battleground states—from Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), who just drew a challenger in Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, to Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Martha McSally (R-AZ)—are all co-sponsors of Grassley’s bill with Wyden. Grassley noted that this effort could help the GOP get stronger with the voting public on healthcare, an issue Democrats have led on in polling for some time. He also noted that President Donald Trump has been supportive of his efforts on this front and he believes that passing it would help President Trump get re-elected. “I want to help President Trump get re-elected. President Trump is right on the prescription drug thing,” Grassley said. “I give him credit for bringing this up six or seven months before I ever got to be chairman of this committee and I’m bringing it up. It happens that Republicans don’t have a healthcare message, and that came out strongly in a lot of resentment expressed to the leadership of our caucus in our retreat a week ago Wednesday. Democrats have a very strong message and you may have read where the president was irritated in the Oval Office to Secretary Azar because the president had such poor poll numbers on health and the reason the president has such poor poll numbers on it is because the Republicans in the United States Senate aren’t working to back him. We do have a good record on the economy, creating jobs, the booming economy, but wage growth doesn’t mean as much if it’s going to be spent all your increase in wages is going to be spent on expensive prescription drug refills every month. You bring up control of the United States Senate. Senator Daines in Montana is going to have a tougher race now that the governor announced against him. Senator McSally and Senator Ernst and Senator Collins—we need to get them all re-elected. Leader McConnell can help by bringing this to a vote and then I guess I said this too many times that this is the only bipartisan bill they can get votes in the United States Senate and we got to get around it if we are going to get ahead of the Democrats on health care because they’ve been outbidding us with the voters on healthcare for a long period of time. It’s because the president’s out front. He needs to talk about it more, but he needs to get the Senate to move on our bill.” Grassley is working on getting more GOP senators to support his effort. More than a dozen already do, but he’s looking for even more support to be able to convince Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put his bill on the floor and force Pelosi’s hand by passing it out of the Senate. Asked to make his case to his Republican colleagues, Grassley said policy-wise they are already with him on this—and it is a purely political question at this stage as to whether they will get on board with it. “Well, I shouldn’t have to worry about policy because what we’re doing is the best policy for conservatives,” Grassley said. “We’re trying to save the taxpayers money, we’re trying to reduce subsidies to the corporate welfare that we condemn so often and all that. So, I shouldn’t have to argue policy. So, it’s all about politics. We don’t have a message. We need a message ,and prescription drug pricing is one of the three or four top issues in elections, and some surveys say it’s the number one issue. In my state of Iowa, I hear about it all the time and Ernst does. If we can get this to a vote we aren’t going to have trouble getting a majority of Republicans on board and so far I think that a lot of people would like to support our bill, but they don’t know if it’s going to come up, and why put your name on the dotted line if you might not have to deal with it? That’s why the president working with McConnell can get this bill up, and once we get a bill up we’ll get it passed.” Asked what the public can do to help him if they support his bill, Grassley asked the audience of Breitbart News to call their senators and back his bill—which has the president’s support—by cosponsoring it. “Help the president of the United States who deserves more credit than I do for bringing this issue up because in the summer of 2018 he made a very major speech about the necessity of getting drug prices down,” Grassley said. “He was filing on things that he said during his campaign—he got elected on it, and he wants to be successful on it. He wants to run for re-election on it. It won’t happen unless your listeners, the Breitbart listeners, get on their United States Senator to do two things; One, get on the bill as a co-sponsor. And then urge the Republican senators to urge McConnell to bring it up and then praise the president for his leadership and say since this is one of the three or four major issues before the voters right now and the Democrats have outperformed us on healthcare messaging we’ve got to increase our messaging. There’s a hundred ways you can talk about healthcare but the thing that really hits the pocketbooks of the consumers is the price of prescription drugs—it’s one of the three or four top things and this is a necessity for movement if we want to re-elect the president of the United States and we want to keep a majority in the United States Senate.” LISTEN TO SEN.

"The Working Families Party (WFP), which previously endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), formally backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Monday. The influential left-wing group announced on Monday, the day prior to the March 10 primary contests, that it is backing Sanders’ presidential bid and will work to persuade Warren supporters in joining his movement: BREAKING: We’re endorsing @BernieSanders for president!

Organized capital won’t rest and neither will we,” WFP National Director Maurice Mitchell said in a statement, according to Politico. Mitchell continued: We said from the very beginning that there were two progressive champions in this race, and that our North Star was to elect one of them as president. Now, the Working Families Party will marshal its grassroots supporters and staff to help Sen. Sanders win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump. The Sanders campaign and supporters initially signaled concern after the WFP, which supported Sanders in 2015, backed Warren over the Vermont senator. Sanders ultimately had to address accusations of his supporters launching “hateful, violent and racist threats” toward those associated with the WFP after it endorsed his rival. As Breitbart News reported: Black leaders — including Black Lives Matter leaders, like co-founder Patrisse Cullors — signed a letter, which condemned the “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space,” Sanders said following the release of the letter. “We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House”: This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space.

"Incoming White House Chief of Staff and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) revealed on Monday night that he will self-quarantine, as he might have been exposed to someone who had the novel coronavirus. Meadows spokesman Ben Williamson said in a statement on Monday: Rep. Meadows was advised this weekend that he may have come in contact with the CPAC attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, now 12 days ago. Out of an abundance of caution, Meadows received testing which came back negative. While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday. Meadows joins a growing list of lawmakers that may have been exposed to coronavirus after attending CPAC two weeks ago. Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-TX), Doug Collins (R-GA), and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) have announced over the last two days that they may have been exposed to coronavirus after attending the conservative conference two weeks ago. Gohmert said in a statement on Monday: Saturday night, I got a call from the House physician advising that I had been possibly been exposed to the COVID-19 virus at CPAC on February 27th, and that a top CDC physician in Atlanta would call me to discuss what should be done going forward…I was and am asymptomatic. Meadows’s announcement follows as President Donald Trump and the White House commenced several steps to help Americans suffering economically from the spread of the coronavirus. President Trump said that he would meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss a payroll tax cut, financial assistance for hourly workers, loans for small businesses, and financial aid for the airline and cruise industries. The president said, “We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American public and the American economy.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"We’ve been in court for years over Hillary Clinton’s emails — as you know, we are persistent for justice. The great news is that U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth has granted our request to depose the former secretary of state about her emails and Benghazi attack documents. The court also ordered the deposition of Clinton’s former Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, and two other State Department officials. Additionally, the court granted our request to subpoena Google for relevant documents and records associated with Clinton’s emails during her tenure at the State Department. The ruling comes in our lawsuit seeking records concerning “talking points or updates on the Benghazi attack” (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01242)). Remember, it was Judicial Watch that discovered in 2014 that the “talking points” that provided the basis for Susan Rice’s false statements were created by the Obama White House. This FOIA lawsuit led directly to the disclosure of the Clinton email system in 2015. In December 2018, Judge Lamberth first ordered discovery into whether Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server was intended to stymie FOIA; whether the State Department’s intent to settle this case in late 2014 and early 2015 amounted to bad faith; and whether the State Department has adequately searched for records responsive to our request. The court also authorized discovery into whether the Benghazi controversy motivated the cover-up of Clinton’s email. The court ruled that the Clinton email system was “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.” The State and Justice Departments continued to defend Clinton’s and the agency’s email conduct. Judge Lamberth has now overruled Clinton’s and the State and Justice Department’s objections to limited additional discovery by first noting: Discovery up until this point has brought to light a noteworthy amount of relevant information, but Judicial Watch requests an additional round of discovery, and understandably so. With each passing round of discovery, the Court is left with more questions than answers. Additionally, Judge Lamberth said that he is troubled by the fact that both the State Department and Department of Justice want to close discovery in this case: [T]here is still more to learn. Even though many important questions remain unanswered, the Justice Department inexplicably still takes the position that the Court should close discovery and rule on dispositive motions. The Court is especially troubled by this. To argue that the Court now has enough information to determine whether State conducted an adequate search is preposterous, especially when considering State’s deficient representations regarding the existence of additional Clinton emails. Instead, the Court will authorize a new round of discovery With respect to Clinton, the court found that her prior testimony, mostly through written sworn answers, was not sufficient: The Court has considered the numerous times in which Secretary Clinton said she could not recall or remember certain details in her prior interrogatory answers. In a deposition, it is more likely that the plaintiff’s counsel could use documents and other testimony to attempt to refresh her recollection. And so, to avoid the unsatisfying and inefficient outcome of multiple rounds of fruitless interrogatories and move this almost six-year-old case closer to its conclusion, Judicial Watch will be permitted to clarify and further explore Secretary Clinton’s answers in person and immediately after she gives them. The Court agrees with Judicial Watch – it is time to hear directly from Secretary Clinton. We uncovered the Clinton email scandal and we’re pleased that the court authorized us to depose Mrs. Clinton directly on her email conduct and how it impacted the people’s ‘right to know’ under FOIA. The deposition must take place by May 16, so stay tuned.","Fitton: Victory!

"Hundreds of flights from quarantined Italy, due to the rapid outbreak of the coronavirus which began in Wuhan, China, are continuing to the interior of the United States. In Italy, government officials have implemented a quarantine for the entire country in an effort to contain the coronavirus, as deaths have increased to 463 and the number of cases reaches nearly 9,200. The quarantine includes the heavily-affected Lombardy region that includes three airports in and around Milan. Flights from these three airports — Milan Linate Airport, Il Caravaggio Orio al Serio International Airport, and Malpensa Airport — are continuing to the U.S. despite the coronavirus quarantine, as well as flights to the U.S. from the Venice, Italy region. Currently, hundreds of flights from in-or-around Milan to the U.S. remain listed on travel websites like Kayak.com. For the coming week, quarantined Italian residents can book from about 15 to 20 daily roundtrip flights to New York City, New York, from Milan starting at $360. A map on Kayak.com shows flights from coronavirus-quarantined zones in and around Milan, Italy to the United States for this month. (Kayak.com) Other flights allow quarantined Italian residents to fly roundtrip from Milan to Atlanta, Georgia, for as cheap as $580. Tickets for these flights range as high as $745 with layovers in Rome, Italy, and Paris, France. Italian residents quarantined near Venice can also take flights to multiple U.S. cities like Miami, Florida, Dallas, Texas, Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Chicago, Illinois. A flight this month roundtrip from Venice to New York City costs travelers as little as $511. Meanwhile, daily roundtrip flights from Venice to Salt Lake City start at about $1,200. Daily flights from South Korea to the U.S. are also continuing with little-to-no changes. For instance, travelers arriving in the U.S. from Seoul, South Korea, can book a roundtrip flight this month to Denver, Colorado, for less than $1,000. South Korean travelers can also book trips to major U.S. cities like Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Boston, Massachusetts. A map on Kayak.com shows daily flights from South Korea to the United States. The flights have continued despite an outbreak of the coronavirus in South Korea with nearly 7,500 cases and 53 deaths. (Kayak.com) The daily flights to the U.S. from coronavirus-affected Italy and South Korea come as the State Department has yet to issue travel bans for either of the countries. The only travel bans implemented thus far have been for residents and recent visitors of China and Iran. As Breitbart News reported, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport officials confirmed that travelers from Italy and South Korea are not being medically screened once they have arrived in the U.S., but rather they are screened before boarding their flights overseas. To date, there are nearly 600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. and a total of 22 deaths.

But only the most ignorant and racist among us would call it the Wuhan virus. — Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) March 9, 2020  This is irresponsible as well as designed to prompt prejudice. I'd tell you to do better, but I don't think you can. — Jess Phoenix 🌋 (@jessphoenix2018) March 9, 2020  The stupidity, the ignorance behind this is simply astounding, but unfortunately, not at all surprising anymore. Naming a virus after the location from where it likely originated, using that as a shorthand, goes back decades. “Wuhan” was first discovered in Wuhan, China. Ebola was named after a river close to where an outbreak took place in Africa. Lyme disease was named after a Connecticut town experienced an outbreak in 1975. The Zika virus was named after a forest in Uganda in 1947, where scientists discovered what it was. The Marburg virus was first discovered in Marburg, Germany. The West Nile virus is what causes West Nile fever… guess where… Did you know Legionnaires’ disease is named that because the first notable outbreak killed off a bunch of legionnaires in attendance at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia back in 1976? So we literally have decades of precedent in naming diseases after where they were first discovered, including a town in lily-white Connecticut. Good heaven, we have a disease named after a bunch of white, middle-aged legionnaires — but “Wuhan” is now racist. Need I add that “Wuhan” is not even a race? And that anti-science thinking is why Trump won the presidency.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"President Donald Trump announced several major steps forward on Monday at the White House to help Americans suffering economically from fears of the spread of the coronavirus. “We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American public and the American economy,” Trump said. The president announced that he would meet with lawmakers in Washington, DC, on Tuesday to discuss a payroll tax cut, financial assistance for hourly wage earners, loans for small businesses, and financial assistance for the airline and cruise industries. “It’s not their fault, and it’s not this country’s fault,” Trump said about the people affected financially by the ongoing fight. The president’s solutions echoed several proposals detailed by Breitbart Senior Economics Editor John Carney on Monday morning. Trump again praised his own decision to suspend travel from China and establish screening in airports, noting that it helped slow the spread of the virus while Americans could prepare for the response. Trump also thanked Vice President Mike Pence and the Coronavirus Task Force for their efforts. “We have a very strong economy, but this blindsided the world and I think we’ve handled it very, very well,” Trump said. Pence repeated his assertion from medical professionals that the risk of contracting the coronavirus was still low. “The risk of contracting the coronavirus to the American public remains low, and the risk of serious disease among the American public also remains low,” he said. The vice president urged all Americans to visit the website coronavirus.gov for details on how to fight the virus, including “common sense” ways to mitigate the spread. “Together we will get through the coronavirus,” Pence said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reaffirmed his confidence in the strength of the economy, despite the historic slump in the stock market on Monday, calling it “the most resilient economy in the world.” He said that the president would act to provide “whatever support is needed” to help strengthen the economy in the upcoming days. The president appeared at the White House press briefing room with his team on Monday evening to discuss the response to the spread of the virus after returning to Washington, DC from Florida. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) announced that he would isolate himself after learning he had personal contact with a person at CPAC who tested positive for coronavirus, after traveling to Washington from Florida with the president on Air Force One, Gaetz was put into a “closed up” room on Air Force One after he found out he might have been exposed to the virus, according to a reporter who spoke to the congressman. Gaetz spent the weekend with Trump, traveling and dining with the president, including at a fundraiser on Monday, prompting questions about whether or not he was in danger of contracting the disease. Twenty-six people have died from the virus with over 690 Americans testing positive for the disease. Trump did not answer any questions at the press briefing, and Pence said he was unaware whether or not the president had been tested but reassured reporters that he was being monitored by his doctors. Pence also confirmed that he himself had not been tested for the disease.",Donald Trump Announces Financial Assistance for Americans Impacted by Coronavirus,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/donald-trump-announces-financial-assistance-for-americans-impacted-by-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"TEL AVIV – Russia’s top diplomat met with the head of Gaza-based terror group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), prompting outrage from Israel, who filed an official protest to Moscow. ﻿According to the Russian foreign ministry’s website, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his deputy, Mikhail Bogdanov, met with Palestinian Islamic Jihad secretary-general Ziyad al-Nakhalah Wednesday night in Moscow to discuss  “the task of speedy restoration of Palestinian national unity on the political platform of the Palestinian Liberation Organization as a necessary condition for establishing sustainable direct negotiations with Israel.” Gaza, which is run by the Hamas-terror group, has long been at odds with the Palestinian Authority-run West Bank and multiple attempts to build a unity government have failed. According to Iran’s Press TV, the two held “positive” and “profound” talks that also focused on the Trump administration’s plan for Israel-Palestinian peace. PIJ representatives voiced their firm opposition to the US scheme, saying it strives to “eliminate the Palestinian problem, as well as to give up Jerusalem [al-Quds], the West Bank and the right of return of refugees,” the report said, citing Palestine Today website. “The Palestinian people will never give up their historical rights and national principles,” the PIJ representatives were quoted as saying. Israel’s interim ambassador to Russia, Eli Belocerkovsky, denounced the meeting in a letter to Bogdanov.  PIJ, Belocerkovsky noted, is a “terrorist organization supported by Iran that does not recognize Israel’s right to exist and systematically undermines arrangements in the Gaza Strip by attacking Israeli civilians.” The Russian foreign ministry said its representatives had “reaffirmed its firm commitment to the two-state principle” in the meeting. Islamic Jihad has long rejected the idea of two states, a Jewish and a Palestinian one, living side by side, and routinely calls for the annihilation of Israel. The Russia’s embassy in Israel tweeted photos of the meeting, including one of Lavrov and Nakhala shaking hands, but deleted the tweet. According to The Jerusalem Post, the embassy’s spokesman defended the deletion saying, “This topic concerns the Russian Representative Office in Ramallah, and they have their own Twitter account.” Nakhala’s ties with Iran and its Lebanese terror proxy Hezbollah are strong, and the PIJ chief splits his time between Lebanon and neighboring Syria. He is said to have close ties with Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Iranian Quds Force killed by the US earlier this year. Much of the PIJ’s terror activities, including rocket barrages into Israel, are green-lighted by Tehran. He is fluent in Hebrew, the result of spending time in an Israeli jail following an 1971 arrest for his role in Arab Liberation Forces terror attacks. His life sentence was cut short in a 1985 prisoner exchange deal. Three years later, Israel arrested him again and he was deported to Lebanon. In 2018, he was appointed secretary-general of the PIJ, the second-largest terror group in Gaza after Hamas.",Israel Slams Russian FM for Meeting with Islamic Jihad Terror Leader,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/12/israel-slams-russian-fm-for-meeting-with-islamic-jihad-terror-leader/,Breitbart
"Former Vice President Joe Biden proposed his plan to combat the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday by rejoining the Paris climate treaty, contending that there is a “well-documented” link between climate change and public health risks. Biden released his plan to fight the Wuhan virus outbreak and “prepare for future global health threats.” He added that climate change is a “driver of health threats.” In his proposal, the former vice president promised to rejoin the Paris climate treaty “on day one” of his presidential administration” and “lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets.” However, it remains questionable how much good rejoining the Paris climate treaty will do ten months after the former vice president released his plan to combat the coronavirus outbreak. “The link between climate change and health security is well-documented and will create a growing threat to Americans,” Biden wrote. “As President, Biden will fully integrate climate change into our foreign policy and global health security strategies, and prioritize efforts to mitigate disease and migration challenges caused by a warming planet,” he said. The former vice president also said that they would advance the Global Health Security Agenda “to respond to pandemic threats whether caused by natural causes and climate changes, bioterrorism, or laboratory accidents.” Biden also promised to have health experts communicate with the public to combat alleged xenophobia that has followed since the coronavirus outbreak. During Biden’s speech on Thursday, he attacked President Donald Trump for spreading “xenophobia” for describing the coronavirus as a “foreign” virus. “This communication is essential to combating the dangerous epidemic of fear, chaos, and stigmatization that can overtake communities faster than the virus,” Biden said. “Acts of racism and xenophobia against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community must not be tolerated,” he added.

"A pair of Democrat senators offered rare praise of President Donald Trump’s plans to block travel from Europe to prevent additional coronavirus cases coming into the United States. “It seems like of the 35 states that now have coronaviruses, 30 of them have originated in Europe, so I think it’s a wise move,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IlL) said in an interview the New York Post. I think it’s a good step, absolutely,” Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), a moderate Democrat in from a ruby-red state, told the Post. “The fact of the matter is we’re going to have to take some very serious steps.” “And I think the administration started that yesterday. I wish they would have started things a little bit earlier,” he added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declined to criticize the move when asked about it during her weekly press conference Thursday, saying she deferred to task force member Anthony Fauci on the matter. “Dr. Fauci said it was a scientific medical decision. I have a great confidence in Dr. Fauci,” the speaker said. “It’s a decision they made,” she said, adding: “we’ll see whether it’s worth the trouble. I’m here about what we can do to go forward for America’s — putting families first without having a criticism of one of the other things that the president is doing.” Addressing the nation from the Oval Office of the White House, President Trump said the United States will ban travel from European countries for 30 days beginning at midnight Friday in order to prevent new cases of the coronavirus from entering the country. “After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans,” Trump said. President Trump said the ban will not affect travel from Britain and there will be exemptions for Americans overseas who have undergone appropriate screenings. President Trump said he is also instructing the Small Business Administration to provide low-interest loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus and asking Congress to increase funding for this program by $50 billion and provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called for authority over the coronavirus outbreak to be handed to an emergency bipartisan group of experts and to Congress rather than President Donald Trump. Sanders called on President Trump to declare an “emergency” — something Trump already did on Jan. 31 — and then added that the president should essentially, be replaced: Because President Trump is unwilling and unable to lead selflessly, we must immediately convene an emergency bipartisan authority of experts to support and direct a response [to coronavirus] that is comprehensive, compassionate, and based first and foremost on science and fact. In other words, Congress in a bipartisan manner must take responsibility for addressing this unparalleled crisis. Sanders did not explain what constitutional mechanism he would use to transfer the president’s authority. The democratic socialist from Vermont also blamed America’s health care system for the crisis, saying the U.S. was at a disadvantage “because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right.” He also warned that “the number of casualties may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II.” Sanders and his rival for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden, each gave addresses Thursday — both highly partisan in tone and critical of the president’s efforts thus far. Biden released a plan for confronting the pandemic that repeated many steps Trump has already taken, and added a few others — including action to fight climate change, though it did not explain what one issue had to do with the other. Both Sanders and Biden opposed President Trump’s early decision to ban travel from China in January. Sanders said last week that he would not close the borders of the country to stop the spread of the coronavirus from abroad. Joel B.

"In what may be a signal to opponents of the Second Amendment, presidential candidate Joe Biden has hired Robert “Beto” O’Rourke’s former campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon to lead his campaign. “This is a conversation that has been happening over the course of weeks and was confirmed today it will be announced. And I think everyone who is either family or in senior-level positions in the campaign understands that it’s happening,” a source told CBS News. Biden and O’Rourke were together before the Texas primary, where the frontrunner praised his former opponent and, specifically, his stance on the Second Amendment. Biden said O’Rourke would be “the one who leads” Biden’s gun control efforts if he is elected to the White House. But O’Rourke’s campaign strategy on grabbing guns fell flat even with Democrats. O’Rourke dropped out in November — before a single vote had even been cast.
FiveThirtyEight reported: O’Rourke’s tumble in the polls was also accompanied by fundraising difficulties. Having been a prodigious fundraiser in 2018, he seemed capable of attracting the resources to run a top-level presidential campaign, and he showed early promise by raising $6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign, the second best opening day after only former Vice President Joe Biden. But fundraising dollars started drying up shortly thereafter. He had raised only $13 million by the end of the second quarter, and added just another $4.5 million in the third quarter. His debate performances didn’t help him recover either; in fact, his most recent performance seemed to have hurt him. After the October debate, O’Rourke’s net favorability among Democratic primary voters fell by about 6 points in our post-debate poll with Ipsos, the biggest decline for any of the 12 candidates on stage. His place at future debates was in serious jeopardy, too. O’Rourke was two qualifying polls shy of making the November debate and had yet to register a single qualifying survey for the December debate. Now, the very same person who oversaw that will now be shepherding Biden to the November election. “This is a very positive step, to appoint somebody with the broad perspectives that she brings of working within the party and in presidential election cycles,” the anonymous source told CBS News. “The campaign needs a decisionmaker — a single point of management. It didn’t have one. It was needed.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"U.S. stocks plunged lower Thursday as investors feared that stimulus measures would be inadequate and likely come too late to prevent the economy from slipping into a recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 10 percent, near its intraday lows. It was the worst day for the blue chip index since it crashed 22 percent in October 1987. The S&P 500 fell 9.5 percent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.4 percent. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.55 percent. Stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange was briefly halted for the second time this week when, minutes after opening, the S&P fell below the 7 percent threshold that triggers market circuit-breakers. Overnight, futures hit trading curbs for the second time when they indicated a 5 percent decline from the previous close. The Federal Reserve announced a massive intervention, promising to inject an additional $1.5 billion into the repo market this week, bringing its total repo operations up to $1.62 trillion for the week. The Fed also said it would continue to inject liquidity into the market at that elevated level every week for the remainder of the month. That proved inadequate to reassure markets, however. Many investors think direct fiscal intervention is necessary to support the economy but worry that political fighting in Washington, D.C. may lead to an ineffective or overly delayed response from the federal government. President Donald Trump proposed a package of economic measures Wednesday night but indicated that he had not yet won support for them from Capitol Hill lawmakers. Many investors worry that even the president’s package, which included $50 billion of aid to small businesses and payroll tax relief, may stall out on Capitol Hill or may not be enough to prevent an economic meltdown. Democrats proposed their own package–but this was quickly criticized by both President Donald Trump and some Republican lawmakers. Investors were battered by bad news about the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday night and Thursday. The NBA said it was suspending the season, Major League Baseball suspended spring training and said it would delay opening-day, museums around the country announced they would close, and New York said it would ban gatherings of more than 500 people.  ",Stocks Collapse in Worst Day for Dow Since Crash of 1987,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/12/stocks-collapse-in-worst-day-for-dow-since-crash-of-1987/,Breitbart
"Members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) introduced a bipartisan bill to ban all imports from western Xinjiang, China, on Wednesday, asserting it is impossible to keep items manufactured by Muslim slaves out of America otherwise. The Chinese Communist Party has built hundreds of concentration camps in Xinjiang, its largest and westernmost province, in the past two years to imprison the region’s Muslims, the vast majority of which are members of the ethnic Uyghur majority indigenous to the region. China claims these camps are “vocational training centers” used to help unskilled Uyghurs develop talents that match jobs in the Chinese market. Uyghur survivors of the camps say they are used to kill, rape, torture, indoctrinate, and enslave them. Satellite images of the camps show that many are equipped with factories, where survivors say they are forced to work arduous hours manufacturing goods the Chinese government profits from for little to no money. Chinese officials claimed that the Uyghurs enslaved in the camps had all “graduated” from “vocational training” in December. This month, a study by an Australian think tank revealed that “graduation” meant that large numbers of the estimated 1 million to 3 million imprisoned Uyghurs had been transferred nationwide by force to fill labor gaps in factories in other parts of the country. The study found that 83 internationally operating companies – including American companies like Nike, Apple, and Gap – used factories featuring Uyghur slaves to manufacture products or components for products. Introduced alongside the legislation, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the CECC published a report detailing the extent of the use of Uyghur slave labor in China and how difficult it is for a company to verify that the products they import from China were not built by slaves. The report accuses China of crimes against humanity, an international crime that any court in the world has jurisdiction to prosecute, and urges Congress to block all imports with ties to Xinjiang. “The severe human rights abuses, torture, political indoctrination, forced renunciations of faith, and widespread and systematic forced labor occurring in mass internment camps may constitute crimes against humanity under international law,” the report concluded. “As this report details, forced labor exists both within the XUAR’s [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region] system of mass internment camps, and throughout the region, and is confirmed by the testimony of former camp detainees, satellite imagery, and recently leaked Chinese government documents.” The report listed carpets, cell phones, noodles, shoes, tea, and all sorts of clothing, housewares, and electronics among the products that China is forcing imprisoned Uyghurs to manufacture in captivity, while also being forced to endure communist indoctrination, abandon the principles of their Muslim faith, and learn Mandarin, a language that is not native to Xinjiang. Among the companies the commission concludes to be benefitting from this labor are Coca-Cola, Nike, Kraft Heinz, and Campbell Soup. The report clearly states, “due diligence in Xinjiang is not possible.” The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act addresses the results of the report by banning all imports from Xinjiang unless a company can clearly prove that the products were not made by slaves. The burden of proof falls on the person or company trying to import an item from Xinjiang to offer “clear and convincing evidence” that the imports “were not produced wholly or in part by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions.” The bill enjoys bipartisan support from the heads of the CECC. In the House of Representatives, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) will introduce the bill alongside 11 other Congressmen of both parties. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) will introduce the Senate version of the bill, along supported by a bipartisan group of nine senators. “Any U.S. or international company with operations in Xinjiang or working with the Xinjiang government to source labor to other parts of China should reconsider whether they want to be producing products under the aegis of a regional government that is committing “crimes against humanity,” Rep. McGovern said in a statement to the press. “It is long past time for companies to reassess their operations and supply chains in Xinjiang and find alternatives that do not exploit and violate individuals’ human rights.” Rubio similarly asserted that “companies have a moral duty and responsibility to prove that their sourced products have been produced without forced labor.” If passed, the bill will likely significantly curb the import of goods made by Uyghur forced labor. The CECC has heard expert testimony that some of these goods have already made it into America, in particular baby clothing sold at Costco manufactured in Xinjiang. As the bill is limited to Xinjiang, it will not address slave labor in other states bolstered by the mass transfer of imprisoned Uyghurs to replace workers in factories shut down by the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI)’s report published last week indicated that companies manufacturing for Nintendo, Sony, Google, Lacoste, and a total of 83 international companies were being kept open in part by replacing the Han Chinese workers that typically work there with Uyghurs. The Chinese Communist Party, the report revealed, has implemented government programs to encourage companies to “hire” Uyghur slaves at reduced prices, offering tax breaks for using Uyghur labor. “The Chinese government has facilitated the mass transfer of Uyghur and other ethnic minority citizens from the far west region of Xinjiang to factories across the country,” ASPI revealed. “Under conditions that strongly suggest forced labour, Uyghurs are working in factories that are in the supply chains of at least 83 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony and Volkswagen.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",Congress Introduces Bill to Stop Imports of Chinese Goods Made by Muslim Slaves,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/12/congress-introduces-bill-stop-imports-chinese-goods-made-muslim-slaves/,Breitbart

The survey, taken March 6-8, 2020, among 2,480 likely Florida Democrat primary voters, shows Joe Biden (D) dominating the Vermont senator in the Sunshine State. Now that Michael Bloomberg (D), who at one point led in Florida, is out of the race, Biden leads Sanders by a massive 55 points: #Florida @StPetePolls/@Fla_Pol Poll (3/6-8):Biden 69%Sanders 14%Bloomberg 5%Buttigieg 2%Warren 1%Klobuchar 1%Steyer 0% — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) March 12, 2020  The margin of error is +/- two percent. Notably, Sanders comes in with just 14 percent — one point below the 15 percent threshold required to obtain delegates from the delegate-rich state offering 219 delegates total: Florida has 219 delegates at stake in the primary. Of those, 76 will be given out based on the statewide vote, but only to candidates who crack the 15% threshold. Other delegates will be awarded based on performance within Congressional districts. The St Pete Polls survey found Sanders performing better in college towns like Gainesville and Tallahassee than statewide, with the underdog winning 23% or greater support in those markets, so it’s unlikely he leaves Florida empty-handed. Three other states — Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona — will vote on March 17 and offer 155, 136, and 67 delegates, respectively. If Sanders fails to reach the delegate threshold in Florida, it will boost Biden’s delegate lead and further dwindle Sanders’ presidential aspirations. A candidate needs 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. The self-described socialist senator took electoral hits on Super Tuesday, as Biden swept the south. The March 10 primaries, or “Mini Super Tuesday,” also did not work in Sanders’ favor, as he lost the biggest prize of the night, Michigan, to Biden by over 16 percentage points.",Poll Shows Bernie Sanders Missing Delegate Threshold in Florida,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/poll-shows-bernie-sanders-missing-delegate-threshold-in-florida/,Breitbart
"The Czech Republic has followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s lead and banned the entry of foreigners from 13 countries that are considered high-risk coronavirus territories, including the United Kingdom, and has restricted borders with Austria and Germany. Foreigners will not be able to enter the central European country who originate from China, South Korea, of Iran, but also those from the EU’s Italy, Sweden, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and France. Travellers from the UK and Switzerland are also banned. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced the measures on Thursday afternoon in the wake of President Trump banning travellers from 26 European Schengen Zone members from entering the United States for 30 days. The Czech Republic itself is one of the banned countries. The nation also made the unusual move of barring their citizens from travel to those high-risk territories. The measures will be put in place from Saturday and will last for 30 days. Movement from Austria and Germany will also be restricted, with travel between the countries only permissible via 11 border crossings, Radio Prague reports, and foreigners will not be able to enter the Czech territory from either Germany or Austria. Czechs currently overseas will be able to return home, but those coming from high-risk countries will be automatically placed in quarantine. The Interior Ministry will also stop issuing all visas until further notice, the report adds. ‘The EU Disapproves’: Brussels Angry Trump Acted on Coronavirus Without Their Permission https://t.co/2pjuQan6cD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 12, 2020  The Czech prime minister announced restrictions on public gatherings, with pubs and restaurants closing by 8 pm and serving food at shopping malls will also be banned. Libraries, galleries, and sporting facilities will also be closed. Public gatherings of more than 30 people will be prohibited. Police will be deployed to ensure that those ordered to self-isolate do so and do not risk infecting the rest of the population. Prime Minister Babiš said in comments reported by Reuters: “It is clear there will be economic impacts. But now we have to do everything for the virus not to spread, to avoid having it here without control.” “If we see the measures do not have sufficient effect, we will take more,” he added. To date, there have been 96 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Czech Republic but no fatalities. Led by the populist Babiš, once dubbed the Czech Trump, the Czech Republic is the only European Union country to have banned entry of travellers from multiple high-risk countries on such a scale. President Trump had announced his travel ban on Wednesday and criticised the EU for its response to the pandemic. He said: “The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots… As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.” The European Union has criticised President Trump for his decision to prioritise the health of the American people, with a statement from the European Commission expressing that the bloc “disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation”.

"President Trump has suspended all travel from mainland Europe. If this sounds excessive you clearly haven’t been paying attention to just how bad things have got with the coronavirus in parts of the continent. Northern Italy, especially, is experiencing horrors more redolent of a Medieval plague than of an advanced economy in the 21st century. This thread, reportedly from a doctor working in an Accident and Emergency department in a Northern Italian hospital, gives a grim taste: The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all. Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19, they are running 200% capacity We’ve stopped all routine, all ORs have been converted to ITUs and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. There are hundreds of pts with severe resp failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask. Patients above 65 or younger with comorbidities are not even assessed by ITU, I am not saying not tubed, I’m saying not assessed and no ITU staff attends when they arrest. Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed. In other words, many of Italy’s hospitals are overwhelmed. Every day they are having to make terrible Sophie’s Choice style decisions about which patients to save and which ones should be condemned to death — because they simply don’t have enough staff or equipment to keep them all alive. Unless Trump takes drastic action — presuming it isn’t already too late — then this is the fate that awaits America too. That’s why he was absolutely right to act in this dramatic way and for at least two good reasons. First, political: it’s imperative — especially for those of us who believe that a second Trump term is America’s only hope — that by the year-end, when with luck the pandemic will have passed or at least diminished, President Trump emerges as a man who handled this crisis decisively and effectively. It would be just too awful if, despite his many achievements, Trump ended up handing the election to Joe Biden because of a public perception that he’d been dilatory in protecting America from the 21st century’s answer to the Black Death. Second, geopolitical: Trump is right to shut off continental Europe because — in plague terms — it is the equivalent of one of those diseased carcasses that besieging armies used to fling with their ballistas over the city walls. This is a consequence of its open borders policy. Under the European Union’s Schengen Agreement — one of the bloc’s defining features and by their own reckoning, greatest achievement — there is almost complete freedom of movement across national borders. Which means that everyone from gun- and drug-smugglers to terrorists to coronavirus victims can travel from one end of the continent to the other, with individual states virtually powerless to protect their own borders or citizens. Consider Italy. Why is the situation so particularly bad there? Partly it may be cultural: more observant Catholics taking Holy Communion; elderly living cheek-by-jowl with the young; constant social kissing. But perhaps the best explanation so far is this one from David Vance: Many Italians in Northern Italy sold their leather goods and textiles companies to China. Italy then allowed 100,000 Chinese from Wuhan/Wenzhou to move to Italy to work in these factories, with direct Wuhan flights. Result: Northern Italy is Europe’s hotspot for Wuhan Coronavirus pic.twitter.com/eKZ0T59cUY — David Vance (@DVATW) March 12, 2020  He elaborates on his theory here: The murky reality is that the EU turned a blind eye to vast numbers of illegal Chinese immigrants working in Italian factories. The ‘Open Borders’ EU will of course try to keep this under wraps, but reality is, the Chinese Mafia operate Italian textile factories with tens of thousands of illegal immigrants shipping ‘made in Italy’ goods into China and elsewhere. Why didn’t the EU act to stop corrupt Italians taking backhanders from the Chinese mafia? And, of course, thanks to open borders, what is Italy’s problem today will be the problem of neighbours like Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and France tomorrow. Trump understands better than most politicians just what a corrupt, inefficient, porous entity the European Union is — which is why he was so keen for his friends in the United Kingdom to leave it. Europe — as a continent of great individual nations which formed the bedrock of Western Civilisation — is, of course, a magnificent place. But the European Union has gone a long way towards ruining it; certainly, it has rendered it unsafe in the current pandemic. Its open borders policy may be one reason why mainland European countries appear to have disproportionately more coronavirus infection cases than Britain or Ireland — both of which have more control over their borders, thanks to their being surrounded by sea. And we haven’t even got onto the menace posed by the four million or so migrants currently massing on Turkey’s borders with Greece, all of whom are an accelerated viral outbreak just waiting to happen. This is why President Trump has acted wisely in shutting the gates to plague pit Europe. It’s very harsh and there may be economic damage. But in times of crisis as bad as this, quick, tough action now may help prevent a heap of misery later.",Delingpole: Trump Was Right to Shut the Gates on Plague Pit Europe,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/12/delingpole-trump-was-right-to-shut-the-gates-on-plague-pit-europe/,Breitbart
"Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) announced on Thursday that he will self-quarantine after he was exposed to a Brazilian diplomat who tested positive for coronavirus. Scott said that he is feeling healthy and that the risk of him contracting coronavirus is low. However, he will self-quarantine out of concern for public safety. He said in a statement on Thursday: My office was alerted today by the Brazilian Embassy that a member of President Bolsonaro’s delegation tested positive for Coronavirus. On Monday, I met with the President in Miami, and while I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me. The Embassy said the person had no symptoms leading up to or the day of the conference. After consulting with the Senate’s attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don’t need to take a test or quarantine. However, the health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine in an abundance of caution. I am feeling healthy and not experiencing any symptoms at this time. I will still be working on my plan to combat Coronavirus and protect American families, and my offices in D.C. and throughout the state will still be fully operational to help Floridians. Scott’s announcement follows after he canceled a press conference in which he planned to announce his legislation to expand access to coronavirus testing. The Florida conservative’s bill would direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reimburse states that set up and run as many mobile testing sites as possible. Scott’s prepared remarks for Thursday emphasized that increased access to coronavirus testing is the “number one issue right now.” He said: People who need and want to be tested are being turned away. In the nation with the best and most developed health care system in the world, that is absolutely ridiculous. We need to look at what has worked and failed in other countries to address the emerging threat posed by the Coronavirus. Mobile testing is one of the successful ideas we are seeing. It has been used in South Korea and Australia. Some states like Colorado, Connecticut, and Washington are starting to use this method. At these mobile testing sites, people can drive up and get tested at a window.  Just like a fast food restaurant. Not only can more people get tested, it keeps health care workers safer. People need to have access to tests so they can make better decisions about isolating themselves. And, we have to keep our health care workers healthy. We must reduce exposure of health care workers NOW. Testing for the virus is happening in the most haphazard way. And what happens if a large population of our health care workers get exposed?  Who will care for the ill? This is something we cannot waste another day not fixing. If you look at reports, South Korea has been able to fight this virus by expanding testing.  It has been reported that 15,000 people a day are getting tested and 210,000 South Koreans have been tested since Jan. 3, compared to about 6,500 tests completed in the US as of this week. Reports show the fatality rate in South Korea is 0.7%, globally it is 3.4%.  We can learn from these successes and mirror this approach right here in the United States. We need to get ahead of this crisis. Scott also called for shutting down American borders, schools, and government buildings to limit the transmission of coronavirus. “We must always hope for the best but prepare for the worst. We are all in this together. We need to take care of each other,” Scott concluded in his prepared remarks. “We are going to get through this, but we all have to our own part.  And, if you know someone who may need help, call them. Check on them. Let’s watch out for each other.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said Thursday that the worldwide coronavirus pandemic death rate might exceed the deaths directly caused by World War II, which are estimated to be 50–56 million people. In an attempt to blame the virus spread on President Donald Trump, Sanders said, “We have an administration that is largely incompetent and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in our country.” Sanders said, “Cases of coronavirus continues to grow exponentially here in the United States and around the world, and we have witnessed a global economic meltdown which will impact millions of workers in our own country. In the terms of potential deaths, in terms of the economic impact on our economy, the crisis we face from the coronavirus is on the scale of major war, and we must act accordingly. Nobody knows what the number of fatalities may end up being, or the number of people who may get ill and we all hope that that number will be as low as possible, but we also have to face the truth and that is that the number of casualties may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II.” He continued, “If our neighbor or co-worker gets sick, we have the potential to become sick. If our neighbor loses his or her job, then our local community suffers, and we may lose our job. We’re in this together. If doctors and nurses and medical personnel do not have the equipment and the training and the capacity they need right now, people may unnecessarily face additional illness and even death.

"President Donald Trump is leading former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.

The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll shows President Trump tops Biden, the Democrat presidential primary frontrunner, 51 percent to 41 percent in support among likely voters. Eight percent of the poll’s respondents said they are undecided. Sanders trails the president 41 percent to 53 percent, while six percent are unsure about the potential match-up. The figures also show President Trump has hit 50 percent approval among Iowans, marking his highest rating in the poll. “That is a high-water mark in the Iowa Poll,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer. “There are some things about the man, personally, I don’t care for, but policy, yes,” independent voter Steve Jorgensen told the Des Moines Register of President Trump. “His trade policies — particularly for the farmers — I think in the long run are going to turn out great.

"On Thursday, Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden named former Beto O’Rourke campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon as the new manager to head the Biden campaign. O’Rourke ran on a gun control platform while Dillon was managing his campaign and Biden made clear O’Rourke will “be the one who leads” on gun control in a Biden administration. The Washington Post describes Dillon as having “deep ties across the [Democrat] Party.” She served as Barack Obama’s deputy campaign manager in 2012, and worked to “create a new non-profit date exchange” for Democrats in 2019. Dillon volunteered with the Biden campaign prior to becoming campaign manager. Her volunteer efforts began after O’Rourke ended his own presidential campaign. Biden and O’Rourke share very similar views on gun control, with both men supporting a government buyback of “assault weapons.” O’Rourke began pushing said buybacks in September 2019 and Biden, too, pushed taxpayer-funded, government mandated buybacks of certain firearms. On November 7, 2019, Breitbart News reported Biden saying: Folks, look, and I would buy back [assault] weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said on Thursday that lawmakers should consider a swath of measures, including “no-strings” universal basic income (UBI) programs, as a response to the economic impacts of the Chinese coronavirus. The freshman lawmaker weighed in on the ongoing debate over an economic relief package designed to combat the ramifications of the coronavirus. She said while proposals, like expanding unemployment insurance, are good, they are not enough and pushed for far more drastic, big-government measures. “There are enormous sectors of our economy (tipped workers, freelance, shift workers) who may not be ‘unemployed’ but whose lives are still dramatically disrupted to the point of eviction, etc,” she said, suggesting a handful of proposals including extending Medicare and Medicaid coverage to all, freezing evictions, eliminating work requirements for assistance programs, and offering “no-strings” UBI programs: Some are taking about ⬆️unemployment insurance, & while good it’s not nearly enough.

While the bill includes basics like free coronavirus testing, Republicans contend that their colleagues added elements that are unnecessary and ineffective while ignoring other solutions, like a payroll tax cut — a proposal House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) called a “non-starter.” The Democrats’ package includes the expansion of food assistance programs and an emergency paid leave program. “There’s a couple major problems with it. Here’s one glaring problem, under Pelosi’s bill the Social Security Administration will be set up to administer the paid sick leave program,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said on Thursday, adding that it will take six months and therefore not work in time. “It will also hamper the administration from putting out Social Security for those who need it right now that are in harm’s way,” he continued. “This will hurt the very population, it’s supposed to be helping,” he added. “It forces permanent paid sick leave for all businesses without exemptions and no sunsets.” He added that there are “a few ideas that I think that we have brought to the table that can help — employee retention credit, making public health emergencies eligible for major disaster programs” and reiterated that Republicans stand ready to strike a bipartisan deal.

President Trump delivered an Oval Office address to the nation about his administration’s efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The president announced that the United States would bar travel from European countries for 30 days beginning at midnight on Friday. 
“After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans,” he stated. “These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.” Trump said he is also instructing the Small Business Administration to provide low-interest loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus and asking Congress to increase funding for this program by $50 million and provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. The briefing came after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced 31 Americans have died from the COVID-19 outbreak and more than 1,000 have been sickened. Trump warned that the highest risk remains among the elderly population with underlying health conditions and strongly advised nursing homes for the elderly to suspend all medically unnecessary visits and encouraged older people to avoid unnecessary travel. “Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,” Trump said.

"Democrat Rep. Donna Shalala (D-FL) briefly blasted “Fight Song” on her phone during her time to speak on H.R. 6201, the Democrats’ coronavirus economic relief proposal, at a House Rules Committee meeting on Wednesday night. Lawmakers on Wednesday discussed the Democrats’ emergency relief proposal purportedly designed to combat negative economic impacts related to Chinese coronavirus. Shalala, who served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services during former President Bill Clinton’s administration, briefly blasted “Fight Song” — which further rose to popularity after serving as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign song — on her phone before defending the package. “I think it’s a mental health bill,” she said after turning the song off, describing the bill as a means to “reassure and reduce the anxiety and the fear that’s out there in this country.” She argued in favor of the Democrats’ proposal, contending that their colleagues who crafted the bill simply built on existing programs. “And if you look at what our distinguished members did in this bill, they went into their toolbox,” she explained. “They took existing programs that we’ve had hearing after hearing on over the last decade and focused those programs on this particular virus and this set of fears in our communities,” she continued. The package, for example, provides emergency food stamp assistance and suspends work requirements. It also lays out an emergency paid leave benefits program. The Trump administration has pushed for a payroll tax cut, but Democrats have dismissed the idea. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) bluntly called it a “non-starter.” Shalala said the bill will “reassure” families that they have a support network stemming from the federal government, which will help ease fears. “There is nothing really new in this package except that it’s focused very carefully on supporting families that are scared to death about this virus,” she said. “And I think that it goes a long way to reduce anxiety and fear in our communities.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said on Thursday that Republicans will not support the Democrats’ bill because it “comes up short” and remains “off-base.” “There’s a couple major problems with it. Here’s one glaring problem, under Pelosi’s bill, the Social Security Administration will be set up to administer the paid sick leave program. Now this will take more than six months, so it won’t work in time,” McCarthy said. “It will also hamper the administration from putting out Social Security for those who need it right now that are in harm’s way,” he added. “Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi’s first draft from late last night was off-base. It does not focus immediate relief on affected Americans,” he continued, contending that it only “proposes new bureaucracy that would only delay assistance.” “It wanders into policy areas that are not related to the pressing issues at hand,” he noted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also described the Democrats’ proposal as “off-base”: Fortunately, we do not need to choose between Speaker Pelosi’s first draft and doing nothing. I am glad the Administration is continuing talks. The Senate is ready to consider a bipartisan, bicameral package if House Democrats return to the table & work with the President's team. — Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) March 12, 2020  Negotiations are still underway.",Watch: Democrat Lawmaker Blasts Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Tune ‘Fight Song’ During Meeting on Coronavirus Bill,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/watch-democrat-lawmaker-blasts-hillary-clintons-campaign-tune-fight-song-during-meeting-on-coronavirus-bill/,Breitbart
"Former Tonight Show host and comedian Jay Leno says he is backing Joe Biden for president because he is a “decent man.” “People like Joe because he’s got a good character,” Leno said according to The Hill. Jay Leno added that Biden’s big comeback win on Super Tuesday was a “feel good” moment. “It was like the end of ‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’ Remember George Bailey? He was down and out and everybody shows up with money,” Leno insisted. The former TV talk show host said he was amazed at how Biden came roaring back even to beat billionaire Michael Bloomberg. “He spent $11,000 in Massachusetts — that’s one ad, really — and he won. He beat Bloomberg. I mean, I like Michael Bloomberg, but it’s nice to know that $600 million can’t replace character,” he said. Leno, who retired from the Tonight Show in 2014, added that he enjoys being a “news junkie” but insists that he doesn’t “have to pay attention to it.” He also joked that the more things change, the more they stay the same. “The news doesn’t change that much,” Leno said. “If you miss it for a day, you miss everything. If you miss it for a year, you don’t miss anything.” Still, Leno did lament the way the news is covered today. “The news, it’s the same topic every night. It used to be different topics,” he said. “Now it’s just, ‘What outrageous thing did X say this time?'” Leno has often been cited as a somewhat conservative comic but the comedian has noted that he is not a conservative voter. “I’m not conservative. I’ve never voted that way in my life,” he said in 2009.

"The coronavirus outbreak presents a “moment of reckoning” for the United States in reevaluating its approach towards China, assessed Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) during an interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily. Marlow noted the myriad of political issues related to viral outbreak, from national immigration, industrial, and manufacturing policies. He highlighted America’s dependence on Chinese exports of generic and over-the-counter drugs. “We are now largely dependent on China having outsourced so much of our pharmaceutical manufacturing for basic pharmaceutical ingredients, like Tylenol or Advil,” Cotton stated. “They feel empowered to threaten our people if we hurt their feelings, if we extend the travel ban. So we have to have the immediate response to the Wuhan coronavirus, but this is a moment of reckoning in which we will have a far-reaching reevaluation of our relationship with China.” LISTEN: 
China could effectively shut down America’s healthcare system within months given the one-party state’s “global chokehold” on the manufacturing of medicines and medical supplies, explained Rosemary Gibson, author of China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America’s Dependence on China for Medicine, to Breitbart News in February. Attitudes towards China among politicians, particularly Republicans, are changing as a result of President Donald Trump, determined Cotton. “I can tell you that increasingly people are now awake to this threat [from China],” Cotton remarked. “President Trump has done very good job with, frankly, Republicans in Washington over the last four years to make them think a little bit less like corporate managers a little bit more like American patriots first. We made a lot of wrong turns with China over the last 30 years. Now’s the time to fix that, and it’s time to fix it urgently.” Cotton considered calibrating federal government policy to promote domestic production of medicines towards lessening U.S. dependence on Chinese pharmaceutical exports. “f you are engaged, for instance, in manufacturing basic pharmaceutical ingredients in China, I suggest to you that you need to pack up and get out, and if you don’t do it quickly, then the U.S. government may do it for you,” Cotton stated. Asked by Marlow about Congress’s next moves in addressing the coronavirus threat, Cotton replied, “One thing I’m working on particularly is trying to get Deb Fischer’s legislation that would provide many more masks for our healthcare professionals across the finish line this week. This bill should have passed last week as part of our supplemental bill.” Democrats are prioritizing trial lawyers over health and safety for healthcare professionals, Cotton said. “Sen. Fisher has been working on it from the very beginning when we learned that we might face a mask shortage in this country as early as late April, [and] unfortunately the Democrats objected,” Cotton stated. “They put the request of ambulance-chasing trial lawyers to have jackpot justice lawsuits down the road ahead of the safety of our great doctors and nurses.” Cotton warned that Democrats may seek to include irrelevant spending within coronavirus-related emergency funding legislation. Cotton continued, “I hope we get that passed today, whether it’s part of a bigger package, which would be harder to pass or if the Democrats would simply just relent and let it pass by voice vote, because it would be unanimous or near unanimous if we did that. That’s the most immediate thing on which I’m working, because we cannot — whatever happens — we cannot create more doctors and nurses. We can create more test kits. We can create new quarantine sites. We cannot create a new doctor and nurse, and if they don’t have the masks they need to protect themselves as they’re caring for our people, it will be a travesty, and it will be because Democrats put trial lawyers ahead of doctors.” Marlow invited Cotton’s comments on Joe Biden’s vision of China. “Joe Biden, as Robert Gates said, has been wrong on every major foreign policy question of the last 40 years,” replied Cotton. “You actually have to update that to, say, 50 years now? Because he still doesn’t believe that China is a competitor of ours. He still calls the Chinese Communist Party ‘good folks.’” The coronavirus outbreak “is a feature, not a bug” of communism, declared Cotton, recalling the Chinese Communist Party’s conduct. “What we see with the Wuhan coronavirus, it’s not a bug. It is a feature of Communist Party rule,” Cotton said. “If the Chinese Communist Party had simply been open and transparent in early December, if they acknowledged they had a problem, if they had asked for support from the World Health Organization and world-class scientists, not just from the United States but from countries like South Korea and Japan and the countries of Europe, we might have been able to contain this inside of Wuhan, inside of Hubei province. But no, they acted like communists. They suppressed information. They visited people in the middle of the night who tried to blow the whistle on this virus, and now look where we are.” Cotton concluded, “Joe Biden [is] very, very weak on China, a defining issue for our times,” adding, “Joe Biden has been on China’s side for 40 years, not on your side.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

"During a Friday interview on “Fox & Friends,”  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, discussed COVID-19 and its spread in the United States. With some from China suggesting the coronavirus was a weapon devised by the U.S. military and deployed in Wuhan and Democrats claiming that saying the disease originated in China is xenophobic, Fauci said “there’s no doubt” it came from China. “It absolutely came from Wuhan,” Fauci stated. “There’s no doubt about that.” In the interview, Fauci also called for people to “socially distance” themselves to help prevent the spread of the virus. “The situation is different in Seattle, in Washington, because they’ve had the unfortunate situation of having community spread there. Also, in certain areas of California. That’s a bit different than other areas in which there still will ultimately be infection but not exactly the way it is right now,” Fauci advised. “So, you want to be proportionate in what you do, but for sure, you don’t want to do nothing. You want to start doing something to socially distance yourself. How dramatic that is, closing schools and doing other things, should be proportionate. A lot of people, a lot of sections are doing it anyway. I don’t criticize them for that.

Federally Funded Unemployment Benefits to provide your workers with a safety net in case of furloughs. A Payroll Tax Holiday for employers with fewer than 100 employees to reduce your cost of employment and avoid layoffs. “As our nation works together to fight through the health and economic impact of the coronavirus, Congress needs to step up the focus on small business,” said JCN President and CEO Alfredo Ortiz. “Small business is the engine of the American economy and is too big to fail.” “The President understands this, and now it is up to Congress to act immediately – even cancel its recess next week if necessary – and get to work passing a series of policy solutions that will help small businesses fight off this pandemic,” Ortiz continued. “Congress needs to pass a payroll tax holiday for small businesses with 100 or fewer employees that will help both workers and employers.” Ortiz also called on members of Congress to “put down their partisan swords” and work in a more “bipartisan effort.” “Members of Congress need to put down their partisan swords and work to pass these initiatives immediately to maintain the financial health of small businesses and their employees,” Ortiz added. “We have done this in the past in a bipartisan effort.

"Dr. Nicole Saphier told Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that the reason the U.S. had rejected coronavirus test kits from abroad is that they had a 48% false negative rate, meaning sick people would believe, falsely, they were fine. Saphier is a former microbiologist who appears frequently on Fox News as a contributor. She is also the author of Make America Healthy Again: How Bad Behavior and Big Government Caused a Trillion-Dollar Crisis. Saphier generally praised the U.S. response to coronavirus, but said that “the one thing” that was “unacceptable” was the lack of testing kits, noting that the private sector had not been harnessed. She noted that President Donald Trump had acted early by imposing a travel ban on China. “That was the right thing to do,” she said. “What didn’t happen was the mass testing of people in the United States,” she added. “And a part of this was the United States rejected some of these testing kits from elsewhere, and that is because the United States placed high standards on what we use in our health care system. Things have to go through FDA approval. “Although President Trump has lifted many of these restrictions, it is still a process. We want to make sure things are safe, or they’re accurate. And the truth is, the testing kits being used in China — they were reporting up to a 48% false negative rate. So if you got a negative test result, that didn’t actually mean that they didn’t have the virus.”  The U.S., she noted, developed its own test, but was also “found to be faulty” once it was distributed. “This is not so simple as just a yes-or-no answer … it’s very complicated,” she said, noting that some of the criticism was “a little unfair.” She said, given the urgency, that the U.S. should have used even faulty tests at the start, because they would at least have caught some of the positive cases. Dr. Saphier noted that South Korea had been successful at testing because of mass production of testing kits by private biotech companies. Joel B.

It is with deep regret that, following @EquityUK’s statement this morning, all members of Equity’s recently renamed Race Equality Committee (formerly the Equity Minority Ethnic Members Committee) feel we have no choice but to resign as committee members. — Equity Race Equality Committee (@EquityREC) March 13, 2020  The regret, I’m sure, is not shared by the rest of the world. Let’s just remind ourselves briefly of the background. Fox — a likeable, interesting and very talented actor, probably best known for playing DS Hathaway in Lewis — acquired instant public notoriety when he appeared on the BBC political panel show Question Time. His remarks on the show were perfectly unexceptionable. He ventured, for example, that the Duchess of Sussex — aka Princess Meghan — was not a victim of racism. As the Daily Mail reminds us, he said: ‘It’s not racism … we’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe. It’s so easy to throw the charge of racism and it’s really starting to get boring now.’ The audience member then described Fox as a “white, privileged male”, to which he responded: ‘To call me a white, privileged male is to be racist.’ But the Social Justice Warriors wanted blood. Actors are expected to be fully on board with the identity politics/cultural Marxist agenda: any deviation therefrom must be punished. So a campaign was launched by the usual suspects to get Fox for the crime of having original political opinions. What didn’t help was that in the course of an interview on my podcast the Delingpod, Fox had expressed some measured, cautious reservations about the incongruous ‘diversity’ casting in Sam Mendes’s World War One movie 1917. Fox said and did nothing wrong, as I explained at the time, in detail, in my piece Laurence Fox Vs the Diversity Gestapo. Nevertheless, his remarks were seized on by left-wing activists as a sign that Fox was a borderline racist. Among those that jumped on the bandwagon was the actors’ union Equity which branded Fox a ‘disgrace to our industry’. Fox responded unapologetically and robustly: This is the position I took last night and I live by in life. If you can improve on it, I’m all ears.  Or you can keep screeching “Racist!” at me and I can carry on having a jolly good giggle at your expense. The tide is turning. pic.twitter.com/fFJzkzvFsY — Laurence Fox  (@LozzaFox) January 17, 2020  Many actors in Fox’s position would have done the usual thing in the face of Equity’s bullying — and backed down. After all, acting is Fox’s livelihood and when your own industry gangs up and conspires to try to make you into an unemployable non-person what option do you have other than to eat crow? Well, fantastic Mr Fox has shown us that there is another way. Equity has been exposed as illiberal and libellous. The minority of race-baiters from within the Union — Equity’s self-styled Race Equality Committee — have had their wings clipped. If only more of us were prepared to take a brave, principled stand against the forces of woke, as Fox has done, the world would be a much more agreeable place. Here is one of the instigators of Equity’s attack on Fox. I've resigned as @EquityREC Chair over this. @Equity and La*rence F*x can issue as many joint statements and apologies as they like.

If your answer, as I suspect, is Laurence Fox, then here is the question we should all be asking: how in God’s name did nonentities like Daniel York Loh ever manage to acquire such power that they were able to cancel — or attempt to cancel — the careers of genuine talents like Fox?

"The border between Greece and Turkey is becoming increasingly militarised, with heavily armed personnel from either side continuing to pour into the region as illegal migrants seek to punch through the European Union’s common external border with Turkish president’s blessing. Greece is well-accustomed to having its airspace and territorial waters violated hundreds or even thousands of times a year by its much larger neighbour — a NATO ally, on paper — which makes a number of claims on Greek islands and other border territories. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s decision to “open the gates” to Europe on his side of the frontier — and the Greek government’s decision to hold fast, in contrast to its stance in 2015 — has heightened tensions enormously, with the Turks accused of having an active role in transporting migrants to the border, co-ordinating their attempts to breach it, and even arming them with tear gas to attack Greek border forces. These have been heavily reinforced by the Greek armed forces, who the Turks, in turn, have accused of firing on and even killing migrants.

(Photo by ANGELOS TZORTZINIS/AFP via Getty Images) Turkish armed forces are extremely active in the region as well, facing down their Greek counterparts through border fencing and across the Evros river, as well as putting special forces patrol boats into the water. As the Turkish police have been accused of firing tear gas on Greek border guards to support attempts by migrants to break through — accusations seemingly supported by video evidence — so Turkish soldiers have now been accused of firing directly at the Greeks, greatly increasing the chances of a deadly incident on the embattled frontier.

Ylva Johansson, the European Commission responsible for migration, said of a meeting with the Greeks: “We are going to discuss actually what they are doing, but they have to let people apply for asylum.” The Swedish social democrat suggested that the Greek government was breaking EU law, regardless of its claims to have activated a clause in the EU treaties allowing it to bar migrants — “Individuals in the European Union have the right to apply for asylum. This is in the treaty, this is in international law. This we can’t suspend,” she said.

"I have just been blackpilled by Peter Hitchens. Blackpilled, as I’m sure you all know, is that stage of enlightenment beyond redpilled. Not only do you see the truth of things but what you go on to realise is that we are totally doomed: if there is any redemption, it can only be in the next world, not this one. Hitchens, Christian brother of the atheist Christopher, was talking with special reference to Boris Johnson’s Conservative party. I asked him why it is that on so many issues — giving Britain’s 5G contract to a hostile foreign power, going ahead with the expensive, futile and environmentally destructive HS2, the insanity of Net Zero, Keynesian deficit spending etc — Boris’s Conservatives have proved to be every bit as disappointing as the quite fantastically dismal Theresa May Conservatives and the spectacularly useless David Cameron Conservatives. The reason, Hitchens explained, is that the Conservative party isn’t Conservative and hasn’t been for some time. He didn’t use the phrase “it’s not a bug, it’s a feature” — that wouldn’t be Hitchens’s style — but it’s essentially what he means. “There are no Conservatives left,” he told me. “Or at least so few they can make no difference.” The rot set in the 1960s, Hitchens argues. From about this point, the Conservative party ceased to offer a meaningful alternative to the ideology of the left, but simply argued that it would handle Britain’s managed decline more efficiently. The Conservatives did not attempt, for example, to challenge one of the fundamental — and most damaging — tenets of the left’s ideology: egalitarianism. Instead, they accepted all the left’s shibboleths — that selective education, where pupils are set by ability, (eg grammar schools) was unfair; that the war on patriarchy is a good and necessary thing and that there must be more enforced equality in the workplace, even in careers to which women are largely unsuited such as the Army and the fire brigade. “But there has been no attempt to put women on dust carts,” notes Hitchens. Why haven’t conservatives put up more of a fuss about the left’s cultural takeover? Hitchens explains: The best way to revolutionise a country is by small increments. This, of course, is the slogan of Mátyás Rákosi, the hideous Hungarian communist leader. He called it ‘salami slicing.’ The idea being that you sliced away at the liberties and the wealth and the freedoms of civil society in tiny, thin slices – none of which was big enough to provoke organised opposition. But at the end of the process of slicing them there wasn’t any salami left. As a former Trotskyite revolutionary himself, Hitchens knows whereof he speaks. And he’s right. Most of us have a pretty strong idea of what a functioning Western democracy looks like. It has an Army that defends the realm rather than agitates about how best to get more women through the SAS selection test or how to make Muslims feel they can comfortably whip out a prayer mat while on exercise in the Brecons; it has a police force that stops burglaries and knife crime rather than paints its fingernails and BMWs in rainbow colours to show solidarity with LBGTQ issues; it has elite universities which polish the finest minds of a generation by exposure to the best that has ever been thought or written, rather than train them to be nasty, narrow-minded little Social Justice Warriors; and so on. What’s extraordinary is that a nation where — as the Brexit vote suggested — the majority of people are of at least a small-c conservative disposition, there was no serious pushback to any of this lunacy. Most culpable of all is the Conservative party itself. Instead of presenting a coherent opposition to the left’s social justice dogma, it actively embraced it. One of the key moments, Hitchens argues, was when Labour leader Tony Blair — who, Hitchens believes, remained a Trotskyite long after his student days — made a speech on the 2001 campaign trail effectively setting out the terms on which any future Conservative administration had to obey if it was ever to see power. David Cameron duly obliged by announcing himself as the Heir to Blair. The Conservatives never seriously attempted to counter the left’s constant suggestion that they were heartless, selfish, uncaring – the ‘Nasty Party’ as Theresa May once styled them. As Hitchens says: “Nobody ever responded by saying that actually there are humane and civilised arguments which can be made responsibly by intelligent people which suggest that [the left’s policies] are mechanisms which although they appear to be good have terrible effects and need to be resisted. It was never done. There was no development of a conservative thought process, no critique, no basis for a conservative long march through the institutions – because there are no conservatives.” I wish he were wrong. But you only need to look at Boris Johnson’s Conservatives, which are merely continuation John Major, David Cameron and Theresa May, to realise that Hitchens is absolutely right. The full Hitchens interview will be broadcast next Thursday on the Delingpod podcast.","Hitchens: Of Course Boris Will Disappoint, There Are No Conservatives Left in Britain",2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/13/hitchens-of-course-boris-will-disappoint-there-are-no-conservatives-left-in-britain/,Breitbart
"We now know the cost of impeachment. While Democrats were diverting the attention and energy of the entire country into a pointless trial that could not possibly have ended in anything other than President Donald Trump’s acquittal, the coronavirus pandemic was beginning in China and arriving in the United States. The timeline of the two developments — impeachment and coronavirus — is shocking, and reveals the true cost of hyper-partisanship. For twenty days, from the day the first death from coronavirus was known, Democrats did nothing about it. They were too busy with the president’s impeachment trial — a trial Pelosi had delayed unnecessarily for several weeks. To the extent that they commented on coronavirus at all, it was only to tear up the president’s remarks or to call him a racist. They told the nation that he, not coronavirus, was a threat to the national security of the United States. In the midst of that all-consuming trial, it is remarkable Trump was able to do anything else at all. But he did, and one of the things he did was impose the China travel ban, just one day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, and the day before the first victim of the pandemic died outside China. For his trouble, he was criticized by the World Health Organization and called “hysterical” by his future 2020 rival. When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them. Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner. But we know why. Joel B.

"Federal government bureaucracy has reportedly plagued some aspects of the coronavirus response, including the availability of tests and making it more difficult for private labs to conduct tests. That’s a problem Rep. Greg Murphy (R-NC) recognizes and hopes to overcome. During an interview with Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN on Thursday, Murphy called out the Food and Drug Administration and credited the Trump administration for making efforts cut down on regulations. “I think that has been a major problem,” he said. “CDC came out with tests first. They were not the correct tests. They had a lot of chemical problems. The FDA several years ago put a lot of handcuffs on labs and hospitals to what testing they could do. And that has stunted our response. I think the administration has been spot-on to cut down those regulations, and now testing is increasing markedly.” However, Murphy said in recognizing those difficulties, it could be a preview of what government-run health care would be like. “If anybody wants a notion of what government-run health care would look like, this is a perfect example of what regulation and government bureaucracy looks like,” Murphy added. “I think the administration is doing exactly what it can at this point in time to decrease the amount of regulatory burden and get these tests out.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",GOP Rep.

"The United States military conducted “defensive” airstrikes against five Kata’ib Hizbollah (KH) weapons storage facilities across Iraq, significantly degrading the Iran-backed Shia militia’s ability to conduct future attacks against coalition forces, the Pentagon said Thursday. “These strikes were defensive, proportional, and in direct response to the threat posed by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups (SMG) who continue to attack bases hosting [Operation Inherent Resolve] coalition forces,” the Pentagon said in a statement. A rocket attack on Camp Taji on Wednesday killed one U.K. and two U.S. service members and wounded 14 others. “The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement. “As we have demonstrated in recent months, we will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region.” The Pentagon discussed the protection of U.S. and coalition forces with senior Iraqi officials, according to the department. “A number of SMGs, including KH, have a strong linkage with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force and have repeatedly received lethal aid and other support from Iran that they have used to attack coalition forces,” the statement said. “These SMGs and their Iranian supporters must cease their attacks on U.S. and coalition forces or face consequences at a time and place of our choosing,” it said.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s proposal for combatting the coronavirus cribs heavily from actions the Trump administration has already taken against the pandemic. Biden, whom many believe has locked up the Democrat nomination, unveiled his plan in a televised address on Thursday. The speech, which was billed beforehand by supporters as commander-in-chief-worthy, heavily criticized President Donald Trump’s efforts to contain the pandemic. “Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the hollowing out of agencies and the disparagement of science,” Biden said. Adding that “our ability to derive a global response” was also “dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world.” Instead of urging unity and calm, Biden spent a large portion of the speech leveling political attacks on the president. Biden, in particular, argued that Trump’s policies and demeanor in the White House only exacerbated tensions in the public health and safety sectors. “Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,” the former vice president said. “Public fears are being compounded by [a] pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by an adversarial relationship with the truth.” Despite the tough rhetoric, many of the proposals Biden suggested for combatting the virus were, in fact, already central to the Trump administration’s efforts. For instance, Biden’s plan calls for “no efforts” to be spared in getting private laboratories and universities to help test for the virus. The suggestion mirrors a move the Trump administration took in February in ordering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow hundreds of academic hospitals and private laboratories to start testing for the coronavirus. Similarly, the former vice president’s plan argues in favor of a federal relief effort for small businesses negatively impacted by the pandemic. The idea is identical to one Trump, himself, proposed on Wednesday, while addressing the nation in primetime. Trump’s version, which has been presented to Congress in the form of a $50 billion appropriation for low-interest loans to small businesses, includes detailed requirements for cost, eligibility, and implementation. Biden’s proposal, on the other hand, is vague in terms of cost, only stating the former vice president would push for the creation of a small-business loan program upon taking office. Other core recommendations from Biden’s plan are indistinguishable from current Trump administration efforts. Specifically, the former vice president’s proposal calls for revising existing laws and regulations to ensure insurance companies waive co-pays and deductibles for coronavirus testing and “any eventual vaccine.” Although Biden’s plan has an elaborate mechanism for ensuring such payments are waived, it remains unclear if such an extensive structural change is needed. The question is especially uncertain after Trump announced on Wednesday that he had convinced insurance providers to commit to waiving the costs for coronavirus. Trump has also secured other important concessions, including the expansion of coverage for treatment across all insurance plans. While this means that an eventual vaccine for the virus would not necessarily be free, portions of the cost would likely be covered. Likewise, the former vice president’s pledge to “accelerate” the development of a vaccine is something the Trump administration has undertaken. In January, officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced they were fast-tracking the development of a coronavirus vaccine in anticipation of potential outbreak. At the time, health officials were hoping that a streamlined process would ensure the vaccine was ready for clinical trials by at least May. Biden’s proposal does not elaborate on how it would expedite the process any further, apart from stating the NIH “must be responsible for the clinical trial networks and work closely with the FDA on trial approvals.” The similarities between Biden’s proposal and what the current administration is already doing to combat the coronavirus did not escape notice on Thursday. “Joe Biden’s coronavirus remarks today sounded awfully familiar,” Andrew Clark, the Trump campaign’s rapid response director, said in an email to Breitbart News. “Listening to him, we felt a sense of déjà vu.” This is not the first time this election cycle the former vice president has attracted scrutiny for the similarities between his official proposals and other sources. In July 2019, Biden’s campaign released its policy for tackling climate change to much fanfare. Later it emerged, however, that some of the text and ideas presented had actually been borrowed, without attribution, from several high-profile climate change advocacy groups.",Biden’s Coronavirus Proposal Cribs Heavily from Trump Administration,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/12/bidens-coronavirus-proposal-cribs-heavily-from-trump-administration/,Breitbart

"On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” Rep. and former HHS Secretary Donna Shalala (D-FL) stated that President Trump is “undisciplined” and “dangerous to our health.” Shalala said, “Well, this president is dangerous to our health.

"A study under peer review at Princeton University has found that the novel coronavirus can, in fact, survive on its own “up to days” at a time. “Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days,” the abstract says: HCoV-19 (SARS-2) has caused >88,000 reported illnesses with a current case-fatality ratio of ~2%. Here, we investigate the stability of viable HCoV-19 on surfaces and in aerosols in comparison with SARS35 CoV-1. Overall, stability is very similar between HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1. We found that viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 2.7 hours. Both viruses show relatively long viability on stainless steel and polypropylene compared to copper or cardboard: the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 is around 13 hours on steel and around 16 hours on polypropylene. Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. In plain speech, the study, currently being reviewed by Princeton University, has found that the virus can survive floating in the air for up to three hours, and up to three days on both plastics and stainless steel. These findings mean that containment of the global pandemic known as the novel coronavirus, or, officially “COVID-19,” could be far more difficult than previously believed. The World Health Organization has stated that they are “deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction” in response to the contagion. As states across the nation begin to shut down public gatherings and issue health alerts, the federal government is struggling to find adequate measures to test victims and develop a vaccine.

"President Donald Trump suggested on Thursday at the White House that organizers postpone the Olympics for a year rather than cancel them outright because of the coronavirus. “This is just my idea: maybe they postpone it for a year,” Donald Trump theorized. “Maybe they do that if that’s possible.” The president floated the possibility of postponing the games after reporters at the White House asked him about his thoughts about the games during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. The 2020 Summer Olympic Games are scheduled to begin on July 24 in Tokyo, Japan, but it is unclear whether the games will continue as scheduled. Trump acknowledged that organizers probably would not hold the games without people attending. “I just can’t see having no people there,” he said. The president wished Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “good luck” going forward, praising his newly constructed venues for the unique opportunity. “They did such a perfect job. The venues are incredible,” Trump said, noting that he had seen pictures of the Olympic site in Tokyo. “They built it very well … and they’re beautiful facilities.” Estimates show that Japan would lose up to $75 million in revenue if the games are canceled.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden offered his own plan for the federal government’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, and it includes a call for more testing immediately. “The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of leadership, planning and execution. The White House should measure and report each day, each and every day, how many tests have been ordered, how many tests have been completed, and how many have tested positive. By next week the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands,” Biden said at the press conference where he announced his plan. (emphasis added) Biden did not specify how he would deal with the critical problem that has been identified as a barrier to making the tests more widely available: the shortage of key materials necessary to produce the tests combined with high demand for tests in other countries. Biden’s assertion that the number of Coronavirus (COVID-19) tests to be conducted in the United States “should be in the millions . . . by next week” appears to significantly beyond any realistic assessment of what is logistically possible. About 600,000 Coronavirus tests have been conducted in eight countries that have experienced outbreaks since the virus first surfaced in Wuhan, China back in December, Business Insider reports. As of March 8, the breakdown of the number of tests completed by country, according to Business Insider, is: The most recent estimate of the total number of Coronavirus tests conducted in the United States as of Thursday in any venue is about 5,000. Biden’s plan offered no specifics as to how 995,000 additional Coronavirus tests could be administered next week in the United States. Politico reported on Tuesday that the ability to ramp up testing is being hampered by limited availability of key materials. A looming shortage in lab materials is threatening to delay coronavirus test results and cause officials to undercount the number of Americans with the virus. . . CDC Director Robert Redfield told POLITICO on Tuesday that he is not confident that U.S. labs have an adequate stock of the supplies used to extract genetic material from any virus in a patient’s sample — a critical step in coronavirus testing. “The availability of those reagents is obviously being looked at,” he said, referring to the chemicals used for preparing samples. “I’m confident of the actual test that we have, but as people begin to operationalize the test, they realize there’s other things they need to do the test.”   Biden’s plan announced on Thursday does not specify the cost associated with these recommendations. Instead, it states that “Biden believes we must spend whatever it takes, without delay, to meet public health needs and deal with the mounting economic consequences.” “The American people deserve an urgent, robust, and professional response to the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,” the statement announcing his plan begins: That is why Joe Biden is outlining a plan to mount: Biden’s plan focuses on the need for more testing, echoing a theme first advanced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi minutes after President Trump addressed the nation on Wednesday night. His plan identifies five specific recommendations for Coronavirus testing under the heading “Make Corona Testing Widely Available and Free.” In Congressional testimony on Thursday, a key member of the Trump administration conceded that the current testing plan “is failing,’ the Wall Street Journal reported: The federal government’s top infectious-disease doctor said the nation’s system for disease testing has failed during the coronavirus outbreak because people typically need a doctor’s permission to be tested. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified Thursday at a congressional hearing. “That is a failing. It is a failing. Let’s admit it.” . . . In testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Dr. Fauci said the nation’s system is set up for doctors to request tests be done, but not for patients to pursue testing on their own. “You put it out in the public and a physician asks for it and you get it,” Dr. Fauci told lawmakers. “The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.” Fox News reported on Wednesday that Vice President Pence is focused on cutting red tape to get more Coronavirus test kits manufactured and distributed: The COVID-19 test requires three culture swabs: one from the nose, one from the throat and one from the lower lungs. The test requires a person to inhale deeply, cough and spit up saliva and mucus into a sterile collection cup. Pence said that the president’s most important move was bringing in the leaders from the top commercial laboratories in the country, such as Quest and LabCorp, to work with their administration. Pence said that they have already approved a test that is being processed for mass distribution. “We’re clearing the red tape out of the way. That’s going to be the way that in the days ahead we’re going to have a broad-based test available across the country,” he said. The Trump campaign immediately punched back Thursday afternoon at Biden’s Coronavirus plan: In the past, Joe Biden has shown terrible judgment and incompetence in the face of public health issues. The Obama White House had to publicly apologize for and clean up after Biden when his irresponsible remarks caused panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Just weeks ago, he was openly critical of President Trump’s early move to restrict travel from China to the United States in response to the coronavirus – a decision which medical experts agree helped impede the spread of the virus to this country. Yesterday his campaign actually raised the vile conspiracy theory that the President purposely allowed the coronavirus to spread. In times like this, America needs leadership and Biden has shown none. President Trump acted early and decisively and has put the United States on stronger footing than other nations. His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears. While the Trump administration response to date on getting Coronavirus tests out as widely as many health experts believe they should be has been criticized from both sides of the aisle, the Biden plan announced today appears to offer little in the way of practical recommendations to achieve that objective more readily.","Joe Biden Calls for More Coronavirus Testing, Offers No Solution for Shortage of Key Materials",2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/joe-biden-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-offers-no-solution-for-shortage-of-key-materials/,Breitbart
"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has released resources for K-12 teachers and local officials on managing student privacy and ensuring disabled students receive required services during school closures due to the coronavirus outbreak. In addition, since the federal education department issues directives regarding requirements, assessments, and accountability to all local public school districts, the department is considering “flexibilities” during this time of many school closures amid the coronavirus outbreak. Today, we released new resources for educators and local leaders on K-12 flexibilities, student privacy, and educating students with disabilities during the coronavirus outbreak. More info at: https://t.co/y505E6HQS1 Learn more here ⬇️https://t.co/URGhh2EfuN pic.twitter.com/NocKtCKW3h — U.S. Department of Education (@usedgov) March 12, 2020  “We are working closely with our inter-agency partners to provide state and local leaders the information they need to ensure the health and safety of their students and educators,” said DeVos in a press statement. “We will continue to work alongside them and provide them the flexibilities they need in order to best support their communities.” The resources consist of guidance to help education leaders protect student privacy, i.e., managing public health issues related to coronavirus while protecting the privacy of student education records and to ensure students with disabilities continue to receive the services required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Additionally, the education department released information on the “flexibilities” that will be permitted when it comes to accountability standards that are required by the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Specifically, the press statement says that, should a school be closed for an extended period and be unable to meet federal requirements due to absenteeism, the education department would “consider a targeted one-year waiver so that the participation rate or absenteeism metric would not be factored into the school’s Academic Achievement indicator.” The department has posted a “fact sheet” for K-12 schools regarding such “flexibilities.” Regarding federally required state assessments, for example, the department states in the document: [D]ue to the unique circumstances that may arise as a result of COVID-19, such as a school closing during the entire testing window, it may not be feasible for a State to administer some or all of its assessments, in which case the Department would consider a targeted one-year waiver of the assessment requirements for those schools impacted by the extraordinary circumstances. States with schools that must close due to the COVID-19 may also want to consider whether it is possible to adjust or extend the testing window to accommodate as many students as possible, including students in schools that were closed for some period. Similarly, a “Q & A” document has been posted to assist state and local education officials with information regarding IDEA and how to continue services to disabled students during school closures. The IDEA guidance states that, if local education authorities continue to provide education to the general student population during a school closure, then they must also ensure disabled students have equal access to those education opportunities.",Education Department Releases K-12 Guidance amid Coronavirus School Closures,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/ed-dept-guidance-coronavirus-school-closures/,Breitbart
"Princess Cruises and Viking Cruises announced on Wednesday major delays and suspensions in light of the coronavirus pandemic. “It is our intention to reassure our loyal guests, team members and global stakeholders of our commitment to the health, safety and well-being of all who sail with us, as well as those who do business with us, and the countries and communities we visit around the world,” Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, said in the company’s official statement, sent to USA TODAY by spokesperson Negin Kamali. The voluntary 60-day suspension will not go so far as to refund, but tickets will be transferable to a future trip when cruises resume. Princess will also offer “generous future cruise credit” to sweeten the deal. “Princess will honor this offer for those guests who had made final payment and cancelled their booking on or after February 4, 2020,” the cruise line said. “The future cruise credit can be used on any voyage departing through May 1, 2022.” Viking Cruises has made a similar announcement but has gone one step further by making the “difficult decision to temporarily suspend operations” for all cruises, beginning on Thursday and going through at least April 30. “I am writing today because the situation has now become such that operating as a travel company involves significant risks of quarantines or medical detentions, which could diminish the travel experiences for which our guests have been planning,” Viking chairman Torstein Hagen wrote. “As a private company with strong finances, we do not have to worry about quarterly profit expectations – and that flexibility allows us the ability to do what is best for our guests and our employees, as we have always done.” “This is a decision we made with a heavy heart, but with present circumstances what they are, we are unable to deliver the high-quality Viking experience for which we are known,” Hagen said. “We will stand by our guests, employees and partners in these challenging times and hope that they in turn will stand by us.” The coronavirus, officially dubbed “COVID-19” by the World Health Organization, has been officially classified as a global pandemic.

"A judge has ordered the release of former soldier Chelsea Manning because federal officials no longer need Manning’s evidence for the investigation against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The decision came a day after Manning reportedly attempted suicide. Manning was put in detention after the former soldier refused to testify against Assange, who posted secret information that was leaked to him by Manning. In 2013, Manning was convicted of providing classified data to Assange and was sentenced to 35 years in jail by a military court. President Barack Obama subsequently released Manning in 2017. The Washington Post reported: The grand jury investigating the anti-secrecy group is no longer active, federal judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia said. “Ms. Manning’s appearance before the grand jury is no longer needed,” he wrote. “Her detention no longer serves any coercive purpose.” Manning has been detained in the Alexandria Detention Center for 11 months in civil contempt for her refusal to testify. The judge’s order comes a day after the former Army private tried to commit suicide in jail. Authorities said they stepped in before serious harm occurred. After allegedly leaking information to Assange, Manning declared that she was transgender. The declaration was widely applauded by progressives.

"Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) says the “rapid spreading of racism” since the Wuhan, China-originated coronavirus outbreak in the United States is particularly “painful” for immigrants. During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Thursday, Pressley — a member of “The Squad” along with Representatives Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — said calling the virus the “Chinese coronavirus” is hurtful to immigrants living in the U.S. “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen not only the spreading of the virus, but also a rapid spreading of racism and xenophobia,” Pressley said. “We have witnessed at the highest levels, in fact, the Republican Party fanning irresponsibly these flames. One colleague tweeted that ‘Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus.'” “My district is home to nearly 32 percent foreign-born residents with more than a quarter immigrating from Asia,” Pressley continued. “This painful rhetoric has consequences. Restaurants across Boston’s Chinatown have seen up to an 80 percent drop in business, and I believe this has everything to do with the rapid spread of misinformation and paranoia. It is critical that we stand against these inciteful messages… in our communities.” Pressley was making a reference to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who has called the virus the “Chinese coronavirus” while blasting the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda on the global health crisis. Pressley’s remarks echo those of the Chinese government’s media wing, which has claimed that “racism, profiling, hate, and alienation of the Chinese person” amid the coronavirus outbreak is worse than the actual virus.

"Democrats continue to push “globalist” policies amid a worldwide coronavirus outbreak, noted Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Scott Perry (R-PA), highlighting Democrat opposition to travel bans as measures to protect Americans from viral spread. The two congressmen offered their remarks on Wednesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX). “It feels as if this could be a black swan moment for globalism,” said Mansour. “This could also be a moment where we all open our eyes to how dangerously dependent we have been on China.” She asked if the coronavirus outbreak offers an opportunity for bipartisanship in addressing America’s dependence on China for pharmaceutical and medical exports. Biggs replied, “I struggle to see bipartisanship emerging in the current environment. Our folks on the other side of the aisle, they do believe in globalism. They still believe, regardless of risk, in an open southern border. If not for the fact that we’re sitting in a coronavirus issue that’s unprecedented in so many ways, they would be insisting that the president cannot ban travel for either safety or health reasons.” Biggs continued, “They are dyed-in-the-wool globalists and that makes it the idea of working with people who don’t believe ‘America First.’ They still adhere to the Howard Zinn viewpoint of America, which is that we were never good, we were never great, we are an immoral country, and many of them would like to see us become something else.” LISTEN:  Preserving American exceptionalism requires a defeat of Democrats’ political vision, Biggs determined. “I think that we’re going to have to take the House back and maintain the Senate, and get reinforcements in there that understand this country is unique [and] has a unique founding,” Biggs remarked. “It was a divine founding, and [America is] a place that has the light for the whole world. If we ever give that up — if we give it over to the other folks — then I’m not sure that we get that light back in this the world for a very, very long time.” Perry said, “What Andy says [is] absolutely true. They are globalists at heart, and even though I think many of them recognize what China is up to, they simply refuse to really join the Republican Party.” Perry went on, “Case in point, when people refer to it as the virus started in Wuhan, or the Wuhan virus, or anything related to China, immediately our colleagues on the other side of the aisle call us ‘racist.’ These are facts. Facts are facts… It’s not meant to be pejorative. It’s just meant to describe where these maladies have occurred and started from so that we never forget what we learned in the process of trying to fix the situation that we’re in.” Democrats prioritize perceived partisan political advantage over national security, Perry stated. “Instead of getting to the problem at hand, they are so globalist and so disrespectful and just have such disdain for the president that they can’t see their way clear to even face the adversary that we have, even it if it’s in the best interest of their own constituents, their own communities, and their own country,” Perry said.

"Friday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) applauded President Donald Trump’s efforts to rescue the nation from the threats of coronavirus, both on a health level and from an economic standpoint. However, he also criticized his Democrat congressional colleagues for using coronavirus to achieve other policy goals. Gaetz told Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs that Democrats were using coronavirus to alter and expand entitlements in America. “[U]nfortunately, Democrats continue to play politics with the legislation that can facilitate the most effective response by the government,” he said. “It’s pretty simple. Republicans are for testing. We are for the purchasing of medical infrastructure. But Republicans do not believe that in response to the coronavirus, we should realign, reorient and massively expand every entitlement program in the United States.” “For example, we should not permanently change the SNAP program in response to the coronavirus, and I think if the American people saw the way these Democrats try to leverage any possible advantage against the President, they would be disgusted by these tactics, and they would support our Commander-in-Chief as he works to mobilize our government at every level,” Gaetz added. Gaetz pleaded with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to eliminate so-called “poison pills” on legislation tied to coronavirus. “Let’s all get rid of the partisan politics, get rid of the poison pills, and work together on behalf of the American people,” he said. “I don’t think that’s too much to ask.

"Nigel Farage has said that the actions of governments across Europe over coronavirus “show the concept of solidarity, so championed by the EU and their globalist friends, now counts for nothing. We are all nationalists now.” President Donald Trump’s recent decision to bar entry from Europe’s borderless Schengen Area shows that he is prioritising Americans’ health concerns over the economy. European politicians heavily criticised President Trump’s decision as “nationalistic”, opining that “viruses do not recognise borders”, while the European Commission said that the EU “disapproves” of the American leader’s “unilateral” decision made “without consultation” of Brussel’s bureaucrats. The Brexit Party leader pointed out that European governments are themselves acting unilaterally — nationalistically — across the bloc, without the authority of Brussels — threatening the would-be superstate’s central mythology that it alone can guarantee Europeans’ collective safety. “Everybody is looking after Number One. Even if it is understandable for individual nations to focus on their own people, the idea of a bloc such as the EU being willing or able to guarantee the safety and security of all of its members is surely shattered,” Mr Farage wrote in The Telegraph.

Given that it is virtually impossible for anybody to prove good health thanks to testing only taking place when people show physical symptoms of the virus, the question must be asked: what price the Schengen Zone now?” However, Mr Farage also condemned Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, for what he sees as a lack of leadership by failing to take more aggressive measures against coronavirus — and particularly for the apparent failure to screen arrivals from Milan on Sunday after the Italian region of Lombardy had declared a state of emergency.

What they will not forgive is a leader who fails to take proper care of his people. Boris Johnson needs to take heed very quickly. ” He added that even if President Trump’s omission of the United Kingdom from his travel ban “is testament to our new status as an independent country… I suspect it will not be long before Britain is also on the no-fly list.” The Brexiteer further criticised Johnson’s government for its scientific expert claiming that 60 per cent of Britons need to catch the Wuhan virus to develop “herd immunity”, as coronavirus could return annually like the winter flu.

"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has dismissed the case of two Christian midwives who were denied jobs in Sweden for refusing to perform abortions, ruling that the violation of the women’s consciences was “justified”. After losing several court battles in Sweden, the two women — Ellinor Grimmark and Linda Steen — took their plight to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which announced this week it will not take up the case. Swedish law obliges all midwives to perform abortions and makes no allowance for conscientious objection based on religious faith. In dismissing Ms Grimmark’s complaint, ECHR judges recognised there had been “an interference with her freedom of religion under Article Nine” of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) — but insisted that this interference “was proportionate and justified with the view of achieving a legitimate aim.” The interference “had a sufficient basis in Swedish law,” the judges claimed, and “pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the health of women seeking an abortion.” “Sweden provides nationwide abortion services and therefore has a positive obligation to organise its health system in a way as to ensure that the effective exercise of freedom of conscience of health professionals in the professional context does not prevent the provision of such services,” the judges declared. European Court Orders Bosnia to Remove a Serbian Orthodox Church https://t.co/5OkqDjxtNF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 2, 2019  Both women received state funding for their training in Sweden as midwives, but despite Sweden’s acute midwife shortage, they were refused midwifery jobs when they revealed they would be unwilling to carry out abortions. Ms Grimmark applied for a job at the women’s clinic at Värnamo Hospital, which denied her the position but offered her counselling “in order to come to terms with abortions and to change her mind.” The women attempted to redress the wrong through Sweden’s legal system, arguing unsuccessfully that they had suffered discrimination because of their Christian faith and that their freedom of conscience had been violated. The European Court ruling echoed a recent report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which stated that religious liberty must surrender to “human rights” such as the right to an abortion or same-sex marriage. UN official Ahmed Shaheed lamented religiously-informed “laws and policies that restrict sexual and reproductive rights,” including “partial or total bans on access to abortion and contraception.” In his report, Mr Shaheed explicitly condemned the appeal to conscientious objection to avoid having to perform abortions. “One area of particular concern regarding accommodations to national law for religious beliefs is the use of conscientious objection by healthcare providers and institutions unwilling to perform abortions or provide access to contraception on religious grounds,” the Special Rapporteur stated. Shaheed said that the Human Rights Committee “has called on States to ensure that women have access to legal abortion notwithstanding conscientious objection by medical practitioners, which it has referred to as a ‘barrier’ to access.” ‘Death Panel’: European Court Says Terminal Baby Must Die Despite Parents Funding Extra Care https://t.co/3n6nHdP0fA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 29, 2017  Follow @tdwilliamsrome",European Human Rights Court Rules Against Christian Midwives Who Will Not Abort Babies,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/14/european-human-rights-court-rules-against-christian-midwives-who-will-not-abort-babies/,Breitbart
"UNITED NATIONS (AP) – Allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation in UN peacekeeping and political missions rose significantly in 2019, with allegations against civilian personnel nearly doubling, a UN report said Friday. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in the report to the UN General Assembly that while the number of alleged victims and perpetrators decreased last year, the number of allegations increased to 80 from the 56 reported in 2018. More than half of the 2019 allegations — 41 — were related to the UN peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic, while 15 involved the mission in Congo, the report said. The joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur, the UN force in Lebanon, and the former peacekeeping missions in Liberia and Haiti accounted for three-fourths of the remaining 24 cases, it said. The rest involved three special political missions — the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia, and the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea -Bissau. The United Nations has long been in the spotlight over allegations of child rape and other sexual abuses by its peacekeepers, especially those based in Central African Republic and Congo. But the latest figures demonstrate again that sexual misconduct spans the entire UN system. The report said allegations involving UN civilian personnel rose from 13 in 2018 to 25 in 2019, while allegations involving military personnel increased from 39 in 2018 to 49 in 2019. There were 37 allegations associated with paternity claims, it said. As for sexual exploitation and abuse involving staff working for UN agencies, funds and programs, it said 95 allegations were reported in 2019, up from 93 in 2018. UN Study: 90% of All People Hold ‘Deeply Ingrained Bias’ Against Women https://t.co/EoZba5csvE — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  Guterres stressed in the report that the majority of the more than 190,000 uniformed and civilian personnel in more than 30 bodies in the UN system serve “with professionalism and dedication,” but he said “significant challenges” remain in dealing with sexual abuse and exploitation. “The high turnover of personnel, combined with the vulnerable environments in which the United Nations operates, require constant vigilance to ensure that systems are in place to identify and mitigate risk, screen and train our personnel and respond in a victim-centred, timely and robust way to allegations when they are received,” the UN chief said. Guterres has made combating sexual abuse and exploitation a high priority and stressed enforcement of the UN’s “zero-tolerance” policy for sexual misconduct. He initiated a series of reforms to UN peacekeeping to speed up investigations, and appointed a victims’ advocate to help victims of sexual abuse. But Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free World and its Code Blue campaign, which works to fight impunity for sexual exploitation and abuse by UN personnel, said the numbers in the report demonstrate “that the UN is failing, that the secretary-general’s new approach is not succeeding.” She told The Associated Press that “sexual exploitation, at least when tracked year after year after year, is not improving because of the special measures that have been taken.” Donovan also pointed to the report’s finding that 42 per cent of investigations completed since 2010 substantiated allegations, while 58 per cent were unsubstantiated — either for lack of evidence or the alleged perpetrator being fired for misconduct or leaving the United Nations. Asked about the criticism, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that “the report is a very clear picture of the situation.” “The secretary-general has been focused from day one on tackling the scourge of sexual abuse head on,” he said. However, he added, “No one, including the secretary-general can be pleased with the fact that we still have to face these cases and he will continue to focus the work of the organization to tackle it.” UN Flies 'First' EU-funded Planeloads of Somalis, Syrians to Germany, Romania https://t.co/BfeYYMXVQa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 26, 2019 ",Sexual Abuse Allegations Against UN Civilian Staff Double in One Year,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/14/sexual-abuse-allegations-against-un-civilian-staff-double-year/,Breitbart
"The Swedish Public Health Authority has decided to adopt a new strategy in regard to the coronavirus outbreak, stating it will no longer be updating exact numbers of infections. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell spoke at a press conference this week saying that the health authority would be looking at identifying which regions are the most affected by the spread of the coronavirus. “We will no longer discuss whether we have 458 or 562 cases. But instead how large parts of Sweden are affected and how hard they are,” Tegnell said. “These are the kind of questions that will be central to answering. Now it is no longer important to know exactly how many people are infected in Sweden.” Tegnell also said that the health authority expects there is now a high risk of widespread infection of the general public, saying that current infections could be “the tip of an iceberg” and that cases could be more widespread than previously thought, Aftonbladet reports. Swedish authorities have called for limiting gatherings and events to under 500 people to combat the spread of the virus. Aome have cancelled events entirely, while others, such as the Stockholm Royal Dramatic Threatre, have promised to keep events under 450 people including audience and staff. Sweden Not Prepared For Major Coronavirus Outbreak Says Whistle-blower Doctor https://t.co/IvSkpJ9i1U — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 26, 2020  The move to carry on with performances was heavily criticised by Christian Democrat leader Ebba Busch Thor, who wrote on Facebook: “Of course there is no difference between having 499 or 500 people in the audience. The risk lies in the fact that many people gather in the same place.” “In some cases, it is almost inevitable — as in public transport, for example. But theatre visits and other entertainment events can be postponed. It becomes strange that these theatres seem to focus on limiting their losses when the rest of the public sector forces to limit the spread of infection,” she added. Sweden’s ability to handle a major outbreak of the virus has also been called into question by former infection prevention physician Staffan Sylvan, who said there simply is not enough resources to deal with a major outbreak. “At present, our hospitals already have major problems in receiving and caring for urgently ill patients. Why this disinformation about our readiness?” Sweden Govt Says Coronavirus ‘Low Risk’ Will Not Screen Air Travelers https://t.co/WAdmtkoGXa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 26, 2020 ","Sweden to Stop Publishing Coronavirus Numbers, Deems Them ‘Not Important’",2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/14/sweden-to-stop-publishing-coronavirus-numbers-deems-them-not-important/,Breitbart
"Greek authorities have deployed large fans at the Turkish border to blow back against tear gas and other chemicals fired at the Greek border by migrants allegedly armed by Turkey. The large fans were attached to the back of pickup trucks and placed along the border area where Greek authorities have come under repeated attack in recent days by migrants armed with tear gas and with Molotov cocktails. The fans also serve to increase visibility for the Greek authorities, according to a report from Proto Thema, who added that Greek police were also firing blue paint at migrants attempting to cross the border. Civilians have also formed groups to aid authorities, including local hunters and farmers near the border village of Feres, where an estimated 300 or so volunteers are supplying border guards with coffee, water, and food. A video widely circulated on social media also showed a local farmer appearing to be spraying some sort of liquid across the border fence towards roving migrants — later revealed to be simple water, intended to dampen the ground and make it harder for migrants to light fires along the border fence. Proto Thema has released several short videos showing various alleged migrant attacks along the frontier, including a migrant apparently throwing a Molotov cocktail toward Greek border guards.   
  The European Union border agency, Frontex, has announced it will be sending an additional one hundred border guards. Executive Director of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, commented on the measure, saying: “The presence of 100 officers from all around Europe underlines the fact that the protection of the area of the European area of freedom, security and justice is a shared responsibility of all member-states and Frontex.” However, some European governments, such as Finland’s, have said they believe Greece’s decision to suspend asylum applications and push migrants back is “wrong” and against EU law, and the European Commissioner for migration has also suggested that the Mediterranean country must accept migrants who claim to be asylum seekers.

"President Donald Trump announced during his press conference on Friday on the coronavirus outbreak that the United States will be replenishing its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to ensure the nation’s energy security. “Based on the price of oil, I’ve also instructed the Secretary of Energy to purchase at a very good price large quantities of crude oil for storage in the U.S. strategic reserve,” Trump said at the press conference in the White House Rose Garden. “We’re going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry [and furthering] that wonderful goal — which we’ve achieved, which nobody thought was possible — of energy independence,” Trump said. Trump’s announcement follows market turmoil in the international market when Russia and Saudi Arabia’s negotiations recently broke down and the Saudis announced they were increasing production. The industry reacted positively to the president’s announcement, CNBC reported. “It is a fantastic idea,” John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital said in the CNBC report. “The SPR is one of the few levers that the U.S. can pull in times of oil market tumult.” “It has served the country well when supplies get tight or otherwise become unavailable during times of natural disasters or geopolitical turmoil,” Kilduff said. “Releases of supplies have served to short-circuit price rallies in the past, and this filling may well serve to ebb the current sell-off.” “Russia, the world’s second-largest producer, does not appear willing to return to its agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has kept oil in a range around $30 a barrel for much of the last week,” CNBC reported. Saudia Arabia is the de facto leader of OPEC. CNBC reported on Trump’s decision as it relates to the coronavirus: The move to purchase more oil for the U.S. reserve also came as part of the administration’s response of supporting the American economy that’s trying to determine to what extend the novel coronavirus will impact growth. Trump declared a national state of emergency in his Friday speech from the Rose Garden. The Department of Energy describes the importance of the SPR: Established in the aftermath of the 1973-74 oil embargo, the SPR was established to counter a disruption in commercial oil supplies which could threaten the U.S. economy. It is also the critical component for the United States to meet its International Energy Agency obligation to maintain emergency oil stocks. At the press conference, Trump declared a national state of emergency to free up money to help states deal with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) is refusing to listen to the advice of the nation’s leading medical experts, continuing his opposition to travel bans in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. President Donald Trump’s administration has implemented travel bans on China, Iran, and most of Europe to stop the outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S. Leading medical experts said this week that 30 states now have coronavirus cases due to international travel with Europe, from where 70 percent of the world’s new cases are now originating. At least nine leading medical experts said this week that travel bans from highly affected countries are necessary to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Biden, though, has continued his opposition to any travel bans after telling the American public that they must “listen to the experts.” Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said this week the travel bans “have given our country valuable time to prepare, and that is precisely what they were designed to do.” “We knew most of the cases were coming from China and that’s why the President took an unprecedented step of making sure we restricted travel to those areas,” the U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Michael Adams said in a statement. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress this week that without the travel bans, the U.S. would be “worse” off in terms of fighting the coronavirus and confirmed again that, specifically, a travel ban on Europe would stop outbreaks in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield has repeatedly reiterated that travel from Europe is the “real threat” to the U.S. when it comes to containing the coronavirus. Another five leading medical experts agree that travel bans are necessary to stop the spread inside the U.S. of the coronavirus: CDC’s Dr. Stephen Redd: “Within weeks of identifying the outbreak … the restriction of travel from China reduced travel by 90%. I think that was a very helpful move to prevent more cases from China coming into the United States.” [Emphasis added] Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx: “It’s clear that the early work of the president, both with travel restrictions and the ability to quarantine, has bought us the time and space to have this task force be very effective.” [Emphasis added] Professor of Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center Dr. Marc Siegel: “I think [the President] made a very robust response to travel. I definitely agree with Dr. Fauci that [travel bans] decreased the number of cases that we’re seeing here in the United States right now.” [Emphasis added] Chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths Dr. Betsy McCaughey: “The President is doing exactly the right thing by attempting to keep this coronavirus from becoming endemic inside the United States.” [Emphasis added] Medical Director for CityMD Dr. Janette Nesheiwat: “We still need to take precautions … we need to control the incoming cases from around the world, so we know that our President, starting tomorrow, is going to put a temporary ban on travel from Europe, and then we have to focus on containing it in the United States.” [Emphasis added] Regardless, Biden has ignored the advice, denouncing travel bans as a measure that “will not stop” the coronavirus, which directly contradicts at least nine leading medical experts’ opinions. A wall will not stop the coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it. — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) March 13, 2020  This week, Biden released his “combat coronavirus” plan, which does not include a single travel ban — not even for Wuhan, China, where the virus originated — and does not mention the terms “Wuhan” or “China” despite their connections to the issue. If implemented, Biden’s plan would mean that flights directly from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan could continue as regularly scheduled into the interior of the U.S. and every major American city. Biden’s coronavirus plan is similar to that of his 2020 Democrat opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in that both have effectively ruled out protecting American citizens by implementing travel bans. Sanders, this week, explicitly said that he would not close America’s borders even if it stopped the spread of the coronavirus. There have been 2,110 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 48 deaths in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"President Donald Trump on Friday night announced his support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s bill to help Americans impacted financially by the spread of the coronavirus. “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!” Trump said about the bill on Twitter, noting that he fully supported it. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act was the product of heavy negotiations between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after the Speaker released a first draft of the bill on Wednesday night. The president initially stated his opposition to the bill on Thursday, noting that it had too many unrelated “goodies” that Democrats were trying to cram in the bill. Pelosi and Mnuchin continued negotiating throughout Friday as the president announced a state of emergency in the United States to further attack the spread of the coronavirus. The bill includes two weeks of paid sick leave and family medical leave for people affected by the virus, and it strengthens unemployment insurance for people losing their jobs. The bill also includes funding for meal programs for students and seniors. The bill will also make coronavirus tests free for uninsured Americans. But the bill does not include President Trump’s request for a payroll tax cut, something that Democrats viewed as a non-starter. The House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Friday night, and it will likely pass easily with Trump’s support. “I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

"President Donald Trump suggested that he would get tested for the coronavirus at some point, even though he repeatedly said there was no reason to do so as long as he was not showing symptoms. When a reporter asked Donald Trump if he would get tested for the virus after getting photographed next to someone who later tested positive to the virus, he replied, “Most likely, yeah, not for that reason, but because I think I will do that anyway.” When asked when he would get tested, he said that it would happen soon. “Fairly soon, we’re working on that. We’re working out a schedule,” Trump said. The president also received scrutiny after he spent time with CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp, who self-quarantined after having contact with a CPAC attendee who was later found to have the virus. In the past, Trump has repeatedly said he felt no reason to get tested for the virus as long as he was not showing symptoms.

"Dr. Karen Effrem, a pediatrician and education freedom advocate, died on February 12 at the age of 60 after a ten-year battle with breast cancer. Effrem, the president of Education Liberty Watch and co-founder and executive director of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, frequently offered her comments and insights to Breitbart News over the past ten years as parents throughout the nation battled against the Common Core standards in their respective states. The hundreds of articles and insights she shared with parents and lawmakers across the country provided inspiration and sound knowledge and data to help them in their respective fights for parental control of education. With a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University and her pediatric training from the University of Minnesota, Effrem testified before Congress and provided a multitude of writings that analyzed the damage caused by federal control of education, the need for student data privacy, and the fight to maintain parental rights. In addition to her frequent comments to Breitbart News, Effrem was quoted by Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the British Medical Journal, National Journal, Bloomberg News, Politico, CNSNews, and other media outlets. When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced in January 2019 an executive order to eliminate the Common Core standards in his state, Effrem immediately went to work to assist with the rewrite of the Florida math standards. Even in January, only two weeks before her passing, Effrem emailed Breitbart News with her comments on the status of the Florida math standards. “Much stronger and earlier use of the standard algorithm,” she wrote, “with strong emphasis on procedural fluency.” As ill as she was, she continued, “I will be checking about Euclidian geometry and Algebra I by 8th grade.” “Untold numbers of children and their families owe more than they’ll ever know to Karen Effrem,” Jane Robbins, attorney, writer, and frequent co-author with Effrem, told Breitbart News, adding Effrem was a tireless advocate who gave of herself to the very end of her life: She did as much for pro-family education advocacy as anyone in this country. Not only was she brilliant and an encyclopedia of knowledge, but she was utterly tireless. Many times, when I was ready to give up on a particular issue or effort, she talked me into writing just one more piece or having just one more meeting – what do we have to lose? Three weeks before she died, she called to fill me in on the rewrite of the Florida math standards, to which she had contributed so much. She didn’t even mention her health until I asked her how she was doing. As a pediatrician, Karen operated under the guiding principle of protecting innocent children. The threats to kids came from Common Core, and from invasion of their data privacy, and from turning them into guinea pigs for government-sponsored probing of their psyches and personalities. She would fight anything that harmed children. And because so much of what happens in government schools harms children, she never took a break. Upon news of Effrem’s passing, United States Parents Involved in Education retweeted a tribute to her by Georgia Stop Common Core. “We’ve lost a true leader in education activism,” the Georgia parents’ group said. “Dr. Karen Effrem was a brilliant & gentle woman, but a warrior for children.” “Her work in the effort to #StopCommonCore in Florida has left a template for other states to follow,” the group added: She was an amazing woman and warrior for children. She will be dearly missed. RIP Karen🙏🏻💕 https://t.co/EpAxr4Hz8K — USPIE (@StopFedEd) February 14, 2020  Ann Marie Banfield, an education researcher and parental rights advocate in New Hampshire, also shared with Breitbart News that Effrem was “an invaluable resource for parents who fought for parental rights and quality public schools.” Banfield, who also fought against the Common Core standards in New Hampshire, said, “Karen’s detailed research helped all of us fight for our children.” “Fortunately, we still have access to her research so that her legacy will continue,” she added. “We are all grateful for her commitment to parents and children across the country.” Effrem is survived by her husband, Paul; her parents, Gerald and Ruth Swedeen; her children, Maria, Tim and Chris; her grandchildren Gerald and Joseph; her sisters Pam and Paula and their families; and many family and friends. “Despite the enormous battles to be fought, Karen was ever optimistic,” Robbins reflected. “She knew Who was in charge – she loved the Lord and had unshakable faith. What a privilege to have worked with her.”","In Memoriam: Dr. Karen Effrem, Advocate for Education Freedom and Parental Rights",2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/in-memoriam-dr-karen-effrem-advocate-for-education-freedom-and-parental-rights/,Breitbart

"Frank Gaffney, executive chairman and founder of the Center for Security Policy, called for the Trump administration to stop a federally administered retirement fund from investing in Chinese equities, warning of China gaining further leverage over America through the one-party state’s growing control of U.S. finances. On Wednesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight, Gaffney joined host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) to explain how the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), a federal government agency managing the pension funds of federal employees and military personnel, is moving towards greater investment in Chinese securities. Gohmert said of FRTIB, “Some Obama appointees are moving very, very quickly to invest tens of billions of dollars in China and, significantly, in countries that do not meet the requirements of the law with transparency and other requirements. And yet, they’re rushing headlong into putting our retirement accounts in Chinese companies, some of whom make weapons that kill our soldiers.” Increasing interconnectedness between Chinese and American capital markets will soon be “inflicted upon” federal government employees if FRTIB’s intentions are allowed to proceed, warned Gaffney. FRTIB’s plans are “to have [federal employees’] retirement funds — at least those that are being invested in a diversified international portfolio — compulsorily invested in Chinese companies,” explained Gaffney, “some of which are engaged in building South China Sea islands and proliferating various weapon systems for which they’ve been sanctioned; or oppressing Uighurs and other minorities in China with the so-called social credit system; or building weapon systems to be used against Americans.” LISTEN:  Gaffney continued, “Now, think about that for a minute. American military veterans and active personnel are being put in the position [where] they will shortly be compelled to invest their money — their retirement funds — in the companies that are trying to help the Chinese Communist Party being positioned to kill them. It’s obscene.” Gaffney added, “We have already transferred, by some estimates, three trillion dollars from our capital markets to China, and this has enabled all of the bad things that the Chinese are doing. It is the petty cash war that has underwritten so [many] of the threats that we’re now facing from them.” “They aspire to get another three to five trillion dollars out of [U.S.] capital markets in the near future,” said Gaffney of China, “and people in Wall Street are still determined to do that.”  China’s growing control of America’s retirement funds afford the one-party state leverage over the U.S., warned Gaffney.  He remarked, “When 160 — maybe — million Americans have their retirement funds — and other college funds for their kids, and who knows what else — [and] their investment dollars tied up in China, not because they want them there but because that’s what Wall Street has done through these passively managed indexes, you will have created the largest China lobby in the history of the world, and it will be vastly more difficult for us to make the kind of sovereign and security decisions that are vital to our future freedoms under the circumstances,” Gaffney stated. Expanding influence over American financial instruments may enable China to halt future national security measures such as a the coronavirus-related travel ban, Gohmert speculated. FRTIB is run by a five-person board appointed by the executive branch, Gaffney noted. “It’s a five-member board that no one ever heard of,” he said. “It is a partisan operation. It’s still populated by four Democratic representatives members that were appointed during the Obama years, and there’s a fifth who is a Republican, perhaps in name only.” Gaddney went on, “About three years ago, they made a decision that they would begin in 2020 to mirror one of these indexes. It’s called the Morgan Stanley National Index, and it’s the all-country world index ex-U.S., which is a real mouthful, but it’s basically an index that incorporates some six — and increasingly, I think, it will be seven — percent of its holdings in Chinese companies, including some that are directly tied into the People’s Liberation Army as well as the Chinese Communist Party doing malevolent things.” China games globalized capital flows, including U.S. foreign investment via retirement pension funds, to fund its geopolitical ambitions, explained retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, to Breitbart News in September 2019. Increasing U.S. investment in China-based companies places American investors at risk given China’s weaker transparency regulations relative to America, explained Gaffney. “This is imprudent from a financial point of view,” Gaffney estimated. “Look at what’s happening to these Chinese companies. One of them, it was announced last year, lost 4.4 billion dollars. It just went missing. How many more of these companies are in similar financial circumstances is anybody’s guess because we don’t require these Chinese companies in our capital markets to meet our requirements under our laws for transparency, for accountability, for governance, [or] for risk disclosure for heaven’s sakes. They’re given a pass.” Gaffney continued, “I think this was a result of President Obama’s direction, but the SEC — the Securities and Exchange Commission — is continuing this practice, so we don’t really know whether these companies are financially viable, let alone exposing our investors to the reality that they are investing in companies and business and entities that are absolutely inimical to our vital interests, our security interests, among others, our human rights values and the like. This is just insane.” “This mustn’t be allowed to metastasize further into the $500-or-so billion-dollar Federal Thrift Savings Plan, so we need people on the net to be letting the president know this should not happen,” advised Gaffney.
 Mansour asked what can be done to halt China’s growing control of U.S. retirement funds. Gaffney advised the implementation of an “America First” ethos beyond manufacturing to include federal regulation and policy regarding retirement funds, beginning with FRTIB. “My best answer is this is an opportunity to invest in an America First program,” Gaffney recommended. “There is an enormous amount that needs to be done. We’ve been talking about infrastructure for years. There’s innovation. There’s research and development — among other things — for our military. But not least, there’s also the simple capitalization of the lead institution of an American industrial sector, so we can manufacture medicines in this country again, and gloves, and masks, and all kinds of other medical gear, and all of the other things that we foolishly allowed to be shipped off by people whose only interest was maximizing their quarterly profits, and the devil take the hindmost with respect to the national interest, especially the national security interest. So I’d like to say we have an opportunity.” Gaffney added, “I think if the American people get behind this idea that patriotic investing is the alternative — not continuing to invest in our enemies.” Gaffney invited listeners to visit the committee on the Present Danger: CHINA, an organization of which he is vice president.

Trump urged every state to set up emergency operations centers. “You’re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world,” he said, as top executives from health care companies and medical labs stood with the president. The president focused primarily on increasing the number of testing kits available for sick patients who needed to be diagnosed for the virus. Executives from Walmart, CVS, Target, and Walgreens promised to work with the president to increase testing levels and care for individuals. “The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,” he said. Doug McMillon from Walmart said that the company was “eager” to assist the president. “Given what we’re facing, that’s certainly important to do,” he said. “We should all be doing that.” Brian Cornell of Target acknowledged that the CEOs present were typically competitors in the medical and supply industry. “Normally, you’d view us as competitors, but today we’re focused on a common competitor, and that’s defeating the spread of the coronavirus,” he said. The president highlighted efforts from companies Roche and Thermo Risher, as well as LabCorp and Quest, to speedily produce tests and promised that the government would quickly approve them for production. Trump also thanked Google for using its resources and 1,700 engineers to create a website that would help sick Americans locate a testing site. “It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” Trump said. The president also spoke about using his authority to clear the red tape of regulations that might hinder hospitals, doctors, and nursing homes to allow them to properly treat patients infected with the virus. “We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to,” he said. “No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever.” During his press conference, he ceded his powerful podium to government medical professionals including Dr. Deborah Birx, who is helping the vice president lead the task force and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Birx said that the team had accomplished a great deal behind the scenes in the past weeks, acknowledging that it was “invisible” to the press. “[T]his intense effort has not only resulted in innovative solutions but an automated high-throughput system, bringing the availability of these quality coronaviral testing to the American people at unprecedented speed,” she said. Fauci praised Trump’s declaration for allowing everyone to act as quickly and efficiently as possible to fight the virus. “We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases, but we’ll take care of that,” he said. “And ultimately, as the President said, this will end.”",The Whole of America Approach: Donald Trump Assembles Government and Private Industry to Fight Coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/the-whole-of-america-approach-donald-trump-assembles-government-and-private-industry-to-fight-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Populist conservative author and columnist Pat Buchanan is noting that if 2020 Democrats like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were in charge today, American taxpayers would be forced to provide free healthcare to all illegal aliens and border-crossers amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. In a column this week, Buchanan argues the coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan, China, has exposed the agenda of a borderless world with interconnected economies, free trade, and cheaply-made foreign imports — a worldview that has dominated the opinions of big business, the ruling class, Wall Street, and the donor class for the past 30 years. Buchanan writes: It may one day be said that the coronavirus delivered the deathblow to the New World Order, to a half-century of globalization, and to the era of inter-dependence of the world’s great nations. [Emphasis added] … As for the “open borders” crowd, do Democrats still believe that breaking into our country should no longer be a crime, and immigrants arriving illegally should be given free health care, a proposition to which all the Democratic debaters raised their hands? [Emphasis added] … In retrospect, was it wise to have relied on China to produce essential parts for the supply chains of goods vital to our national security? Does it appear wise to have moved the production of pharmaceuticals and lifesaving drugs for heart disease, strokes and diabetes to China? Does it appear wise to have allowed China to develop a virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals crucial to the development of weapons for our defense? [Emphasis added] Biden and Sanders have both repeatedly said that if elected president, they will provide all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the U.S. with free healthcare that American taxpayers would be forced to pay for. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), running for president on an anti-war platform, has been one of the only 2020 Democrats who has consistently opposed free benefits like healthcare and free college tuition for illegal aliens. Already, due to loopholes, American taxpayers are spending nearly $20 billion every year to provide illegal aliens with subsidized healthcare, emergency room visits, and other health services. Under the 2020 Democrats’ plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens living in the U.S., Americans would be billed potentially $660 billion every decade just to cover the costs. Other research has found that the plan would cost Americans at least $23 billion every year. As Breitbart News has reported, experts have said that giving taxpayer-funded healthcare to effectively all foreign nationals who can make it to America’s borders would drive “strong incentives for people with serious health problems to enter the country or remain longer than their visas allow in order to get government-funded care.” There have been 2,110 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 48 deaths in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"President Donald Trump did not take responsibility for shutting down a global health security team, in response to a PBS White House correspondent. During his coronavirus press conference on Friday, Trump took questions from the press. PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asked the POTUS whether he would “take responsibility” for his administration’s lagging response to the novel coronavirus pandemic: You said that you “don’t take responsibility,” but you did disband the White House Pandemic Office, and the officials that were working in that office left this administration abruptly. So what responsibility do you take for that? The officials in that office said that the White House lost valuable time because that office was disbanded. What do you make of that?  Trump shook his head as the question was being asked. “Well, I just think it’s a nasty question,” he said once Alcindor had finished speaking, “because what we’ve done is — and Tony had said numerous times — that we’ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.” “And when you say “me,” I didn’t do it,” Trump continued. “We have a group of people, I could ask, perhaps, my administration. I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it,” he said, turning and gesturing toward Dr. Tony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “You said we did that, I don’t know anything about it.” “You don’t know about the reorganization that happened at the National Security Council?” Alcindor pressed in a dubious tone. Trump spoke over much of the question, but the phrasing was disjointed. “It’s the administration, perhaps they do that, people — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. Things like that happen.” “But this–” Alcindor started, but Trump ended their exchange by signaling to cut her microphone. “We’re doing a great job, let me tell you,” he said.",Trump Shuns ‘Nasty Question’ from PBS White House Correspondent,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/trump-shuns-nasty-question-from-pbs-white-house-correspondent/,Breitbart
"During a press conference on Friday, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) criticized the federal government’s response to the coronavirus and the “inconsistent” messaging from the federal government. She called on President Trump “to step back and appoint one of our public health officials to be the spokesman” and suggested Dr. Anthony Fauci serve as the spokesperson and give daily briefings on the virus. Collins said, “We are making progress at the federal level, but I am not satisfied with the response. I think that the messaging at the federal level has been inconsistent. And when you’re dealing with a novel virus like this, it’s very important that health professionals be out front, and that there be a consistent message. We also, in some parts of the country, are experiencing shortages of tests.” She added, “I would like the president to step back and appoint one of our public health officials to be the spokesman as we go through dealing with this novel virus. My suggestion would be that Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been around for decades, is such a well-regarded infectious disease specialist, has dealt with everything from AIDS to the Zika virus and H1N1 flu be the public face for the federal government. I believe he should give a briefing at the same time each day to update the American people and to also make sure that the messaging is consistent.” (h/t Portland Press Herald) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",GOP Sen.

"The United States’ borders have been flooded with thousands of foreign nationals arriving from countries affected by the Wuhan, China-originated coronavirus. While the U.S. tries to contain the spread of the coronavirus — with leading medical experts blaming international travel and migration for much of the outbreak — nearly 151,000 border crossers and illegal aliens have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border since October 2019 from 72 affected countries, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data reveals. Since October, for example, 1,657 Chinese nationals have been apprehended at the southern border. About 341 of these Chinese nationals sought to enter the U.S. illegally just within the last few months. DHS data finds that Chinese nationals are continuing to arrive at the southern border, with about six being apprehended within the last couple of days. There are now close to 81,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China and 3,180 deaths. “We have a unique public health threat posed by individuals arriving unlawfully at the border, where migrants, law enforcement officials, frontline personnel, and the American public are put at risk,” a senior DHS official told Breitbart News. “All it would take is a single infected individual to impact the detained migrant community within DHS facilities,” the official said. “Without proper precautions, which can only happen through orderly, lawful migration, the virus threatens to spread rapidly. Any halting of [Remain in Mexico] would exacerbate this threat.” Brazil, where 151 cases of the coronavirus are confirmed, has had about 6,400 of their nationals arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border since October. Similarly, eight Iranian nationals, 12 Italian nationals, 346 Russian nationals, 160 Romanian nationals, 204 Vietnamese, 827 Indian nationals, and 1,045 nationals from Cameroon — countries that have a combined coronavirus-infected population of nearly 30,000 and 1,781 deaths. To the south of the U.S., Mexico now has 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and since October, nearly 110,000 Mexican nationals have inundated the southern border. Every confirmed coronavirus case in Mexico involves a person who recently traveled abroad or has been in close contact with a person who recently traveled abroad. Likewise, close to 21,000 Honduran nationals have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past five months as two cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the country. The countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have yet to have any confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but their nationals have traveled through coronavirus-affected Mexico to make their way, illegally, to the U.S. Since October, about 44,370 nationals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have arrived at the southern border by first traveling through coronavirus-affected Mexico. A DHS official told Breitbart News that the volume of migrants, especially from countries with confirmed coronavirus infections, along with crowded federal detention facilities and the straining of public healthcare resources pose a risk in terms of trying to prevent more spread of the virus. Despite the risk, Trump said last week that his administration was not particularly reviewing any plans to close the nation’s most porous border. Already, Trump has implemented travel bans on China, Iran, and most of Europe at the direction of medical experts who say European countries helped spread the coronavirus to about 30 U.S. states. There are now 1,875 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. and 41 deaths. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Appearing Friday on MSNBC’s Deadline White House, Dr. Irwin Redlener, a member of former Vice President Joe Biden’s advisory panel on the coronavirus, called President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly illness an “international embarrassment.” ""It's so late in the process, it's like an international embarrassment of how much we have messed up this entire process of testing that is so critical to our understanding of the disease… It's inexplicable"" – Dr. Irwin Redlener w/ @NicolleDWallace pic.twitter.com/u9jvf8r9CC — Deadline White House (@DeadlineWH) March 13, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows: NICOLLE WALLACE: What did you make of the two big headlines about testing? It went on for so long, about an hour and ten minutes ago we heard from the CEOs of the nation’s chain drugstores. We heard from the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Walgreens, and CVS. What did you make of the information dispensed by them? DR. IRWIN REDLENER: The information was fine — only two months late. I remember about eight weeks ago thinking “what is going on here?” Then, we had a couple hundred tests being done by the CDC and then they distributed the test material around the country about 97 percent of those defective and they pulled it back. I thought It was a one shot, horrible mistake by the federal government and the public health system, but, it’s continuing. It’s still a problem. I spoke to ER doctors this morning who can’t get results. I think it’s going to improve. Governor Cuomo, for example, is starting these drive-through testing facilities. That’s all great and I’m glad that the private sector is getting involved, but it’s so late in the process.

"Roche Diagnostics began shipping 400,000 to 500,000 Coronavirus test kits from the company’s manufacturing facilities in New Jersey on Friday via “the fastest means available” to laboratories around the country. A spokesman for the company, an American subsidiary of Switzerland-based Roche, told Breitbart News on Friday that the SARS-CoV-2 test kits that detect the virus that causes Coronavirus (COVID-19), approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, are being sent to 32 laboratory sites around the country where the company’s cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 molecular testing machines are currently used to run a variety of other medical tests. The spokesman told Breitbart News that 32 out of the 110 laboratory sites in the United States that currently use the cobas 6800/cobas 8800 testing machines were selected as recipients of the first batch of SARS-CoV-2 test kits because they are national reference laboratories or hospitals near areas that have been identified as hot zones of Coronavirus outbreaks. “We want to make tests available to patients where they are needed most. So we worked with the CDC to develop a strategy that prioritizes labs with the broadest geographic reach and highest patient impact. These labs also have the ability to implement high-volume testing immediately,” Roche Diagnostics said in fact sheet emailed to Breitbart News on Friday. The SARS-CoV-2 test is an additional test these laboratories will now be capable of running as early as Monday. Given the current Coronavirus health threats, it is anticipated that many of these laboratories will focus their cobas 6800/cobas 8800 usage on running the SARS-CoV-2 tests. According to the fact sheet emailed to Breitbart News by the company on Friday: The test detects the genetic signature (RNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a simple test performed by a healthcare provider using swab samples from the back of the patient’s throat or nose. . . Healthcare providers can send patient samples to hospital and reference laboratories across the U.S. to run the test. . . After the lab starts the test, results are available in about 3.5 hours. The instruments can process up to 384 results (cobas 6800 System) and 960 results (cobas 8800 System) in an 8-hour shift. Test kits will be shipped throughout the weekend, and all 32 laboratory sites are expected to be ready to run the SARS-CoV-2 tests by Tuesday. The Roche Diagnostics spokesperson told Breitbart News that after the first batch of 400,000 to 500,000 test kits are shipped out this weekend, the company anticipates that it will be able to produce and ship out an additional 400,000 to 500,000 Coronavirus test kits each subsequent week, with an expected monthly test kit production capacity of about 1.5 million. Friday afternoon, President Trump declared a national emergency to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic in the United States. At the press conference announcing the national emergency, “Trump said he expected the U.S. to have 1.4 million coronavirus test kits available within a week, and a total of five million kits within the next month,” CNBC reported. Roche Diagnostics CEO Matt Sause was among several business executives who joined the president at the press conference, as Business Insider reported: CEOs of laboratory, research, and medical device companies also joined Trump, who said that he has called on the labs to expedite efforts to increase the availability of tests for COVID-19. Companies like Roche Diagnostics, whose CEO Matt Sause attended the press conference, recently gained expedited approval for coronavirus testing. The Trump administration has come under criticism for the slow pace at which Coronavirus test kits have been made available in the country. As of earlier this week, only an estimated 5,000 Coronavirus tests had been completed in the United States, a marked contrast to the estimated 320,000 that have been conducted in Guandong Province, China and the 189,000 that have been conducted in South Korea. With weekly shipments of 400,000 to 500,000 SARS-CoV-2 test kits to 32 laboratories, each capable of running Coronavirus tests on a minimum of 384 to a maximum of 2,880 patient samples per day, these laboratories as a group have the capacity to complete anywhere from 12,000 to 92,000 tests per day. Over the next month, that means effective Monday, the United States is expected to have the capacity to complete between 360,000 to 2.7 million Coronavirus tests using the Roche Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 test kits alone. The constraint then becomes Roche Diagnostics’current monthly  production capacity of 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2 test kits. Politico reported on Tuesday that one of the problems with getting Coronavirus test kits distributed in the United States has been a shortage of key materials, specifically, reagents. According to Ann Marie Helminstine, Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences: A reagent is a compound or mixture added to a system to cause a chemical reaction or test if a reaction occurs. A reagent may be used to find out whether or not a specific chemical substance is present by causing a reaction to occur with it. Reagents may be compounds or mixtures. In organic chemistry, most are small organic molecules or inorganic compounds. A shortage of reagents has apparently not been a problem for Roche Diagnostics as it begins production of SARS-CoV-2 test kits, nor does the company expect it to be a problem in the near future. “Everything necessary to carry out the test is in the kit,” the Roche Diagnostics spokesman told Breitbart News.","Roche Diagnostics Ships 400,000 Coronavirus Test Kits to Labs Around the Country for Immediate Use",2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/roche-diagnostics-ships-400000-coronavirus-test-kits-to-labs-around-the-country-for-immediate-use/,Breitbart

"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis on Friday that found that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden’s (D-OR) drug pricing bill would cut spending by $95 billion, reduce out-of-pocket spending, and reduce premiums. The CBO found that Grassley and Wyden’s Drug Pricing Reduction Act would save taxpayers $95 billion, reduce out-of-pocket spending by $72 billion, and reduce premiums by $1 billion. Grassley said in a statement on Friday: “The bill would basically reform a lot of federal spending on health care, particularly through Medicare, Medicaid,” the Iowa senator said. Grassley explained how the bill would reduce government spending, telling Boyle: We would reduce subsidies from Medicare to the pharmaceuticals. We would put a year-over-year cap on price increases at the rate of inflation. We would put a big cap on the amount of money that one consumer would have to spend out-of-pocket. It would save the taxpayers about 80 billion dollars. It would take some of the secrecy out of the pricing of drugs. It would take some of the secrecy out of the middle man that we call a pharmaceutical benefits managers (PBMs), because all that secrecy keeps the marketplace from working, and more transparency would enhance competition. And with the more transparency you get more accountability, and we don’t have that accountability today. It would do away with the donut hole that I won’t explain, but it’s been a controversial part of Part D since it was established in 2003. But the main thing is it would cause the marketplace to work. It would stop subsidies to Big Pharma. Well, not stop subsidies, but it would limit the subsidies, because presently there’s no limit on how much they can increase drug prices – this year five to ten percent – and it ought to be limited to the inflation rate. So that’s a broad summary. It does a lot more than what I just told you. During Trump’s State of the Union address, the president promised to sign a bipartisan drug pricing bill. Trump said: And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. “Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay,” he added.

"CLAIM: President Donald Trump “fired the entire White House pandemic team.” VERDICT: Partly false. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton “dissolved” the pandemic office but staff remained to deal with the issue. Last month, Democrats tried a new way of blaming Trump for the coronavirus outbreak. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg claimed during the Democrat debate in South Carolina that Trump “fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, so there’s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. [Applause] And he’s defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC so we don’t have the organization we need.” Breitbart News rated that “Mostly False.” We noted: In reality, the pandemic expert — Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer — left the National Security Council (NSC) voluntarily after then-National Security Advisor John Bolton was appointed. Bolton disbanded the unit that Ziemer was supervising as part of an effort to downsize the bloated NSC staff… The Trump administration has indeed proposed cuts to the CDC, but they have not been passed by Congress. Moreover, some of the experts who had been part of the office remained on staff at the National Security Council. Earlier this week, Democrats asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the president’s coronavirus team who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, about the decision to cut the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense. He was asked whether it had been a “mistake.” Fauci said no, but added that it would also have been “nice” to have it around. “I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there,” he said. Media are leaving out the first sentence. ""I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there."" https://t.co/CNs5O35vzX — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) March 14, 2020  The media largely ignored the first sentence and focused on the second. On Friday, the former head of the pandemic office, Beth Cameron, wrote a lengthy op-ed in the Washington Post complaining about the decision to “dissolve” her unit. She admitted she did not know “whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House’s interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff.” But she argued the decision created “unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.” Still, she did not claim all the experts had been fired. Also on Friday, a journalist at President Donald Trump’s press conference on coronavirus in the Rose Garden at the White House asked the president about the decision to cut the office. Trump said he did not know about it — which he may not have, since it was a decision made by Bolton. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) took to Twitter to accuse the president of lying, and added that Trump had “fired the entire White House pandemic team.” Not true, @realDonaldTrump. I wrote to you more than 600 days ago demanding answers after you fired the entire White House pandemic team. https://t.co/ICbHOkyeyY pic.twitter.com/71OF9gKA3N — Sherrod Brown (@SenSherrodBrown) March 13, 2020  After his tweet was retweeted by a New York Times reporter, several former NSC officials began to push back. Former senior NSC official Tim Morrison — who testified in the impeachment hearings — called Sen. Brown’s claim “total garbage”: Total garbage.  I ran this team for a year and we worked on NSPM 14 (https://t.co/47ZCsvlSoL) and flu(https://t.co/bUVdE3IdgQ) and Ebola (https://t.co/8QsAV5bEyY). https://t.co/vkFb9Dkygg — Tim_Morrison (@Tim_Morrison) March 13, 2020  Former NCS official Richard Goldberg noted that the staff in question were still at the White House: Weird. A year later I was inside the NSC working with talented global health/biodefense professionals who coordinated an incredibly effective response to Ebola. They’re still there. Working hard. On #Covid_19. https://t.co/XSoBtXtAC5 — Richard Goldberg (@rich_goldberg) March 13, 2020  Ultimately, the argument is about whether the office should have been kept as a separate unit, or whether its functions could be done just as well by employees working in other parts of the organizational structure. Fauci, who is a rare case of an expert whose opinion is valued by both sides, said it was not a “mistake” to cut the office but that it would be “nice” if it were still there. He may agree with the criticism — but only up to a point. At some point it is worth questioning whether now is the best time for Democrats to be looking for a way to blame the president, or a way to help him — after wasting weeks on impeachment while he was tackling coronavirus.

"Actor James Woods warned that the Democrat Party and CNN will continue to exploit the coronavirus pandemic to their own ends, but said that America and its economy will soon “roar back” under the direction of President Donald Trump. The stock market had a torrid start to the week amid fears of the coronavirus pandemic, while the White House today declared an official national state of emergency over the crisis. Markets have since made a partial recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1985 points during Trump’s presser.

For example, some Democratic politicians including failed presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg have released ads attacking Trump’s response to the pandemic, while one New York Times columnist even referred to it as the “Trumpvirus.” However, Woods took to Twitter to confirm that he would increase his holdings in the stock market because of his trust in the American nation and the roaring economy that President Trump has helped create: I am buying more stock, because I believe in America, in this robust economy, and in President Trump. While the doom peddlers at #CNN gleefully cheer the demise of this President AT ANY COST to our proud nation, I’m sticking with the plan. #BuyAmerica #Trump2020 I bought stock heavily this week because a) I want to support this nation and this President, and b) I know that #CNN and the Democrats will exploit this crisis purely out of their hatred for @realDonaldTrump. So the market will wobble and then will eventually roar back. #WinWin. https://twitter.com/realjameswoods/status/1238579653574406145?s=21 Woods is known for his Twitter throwdowns in defense of the President and against the Democrat establishment. Last week, the veteran actor ripped Sen. Chuck Schumer over his threats against Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, declaring that America’s Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment as a safeguard against “violent haters” like the New York Senator. “When the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court must take the extraordinary step of admonishing a United States Senator from targeting the lives of named Justices, we are in civil war territory,” Woods said. “The Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment for violent haters like  Chuck Schumer.” When the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court must take the extraordinary step of admonishing a United States Senator from targeting the lives of named Justices, we are in civil war territory.

"“Hot takes” in politics are a little like armpit noises. Anybody can make them and nobody wants to hear somebody else’s. But there is one political “hot take” emerging this week that really must be considered. It is a little like taking a bite out of something that tastes terrible and then turning to someone you love and saying: “Hey, try this. It tastes terrible.” “Joe Biden proved he is a real fighter,” said some of the most revered political experts in the land this week. After the former vice president mopped the floor with Sen. Bernie Sanders in South Carolina and then cleaned up again this week in states like Michigan and Missouri. Yeah, a real fighter, that Joe Biden. A dog-faced-pony-soldier kind of fighter. He really knows how to plot a political rebirth and rise from the ashes like an ancient white phoenix. Actually, no. He is the same rotting corpse of a candidate he was three weeks ago. It’s just that Democrats have decided that they would be better off with the dead guy than with Mr. Sanders. In other words, the Democrat National Committee won. They killed Mr. Sanders in the crib — for the second straight primary in a row. It’s like “Weekend at Bernie’s,” only it stars anyone but Bernie himself. Either way, Mr. Biden is still a corpse. His electoral revival has nothing to do with Mr. Biden being a fighter, except of course when he is attacking defenseless voters. Then he’s a real tough guy. Calls young women “dog-faced,” cusses out gun owners, calls people liars or accuses them of being “fat.” President Trump is a real fighter. He took on the Republican establishment — and won. He gets into epic fights with people who buy ink by the barrel and newsprint by the freight carload. And then — scandal of all scandals — he took on Washington, delivering his First Inaugural that vowed to keep all the promises that had gotten him elected. (These people still haven’t forgiven him for that one.) Even amid the present crisis over coronavirus, Mr. Trump immediately shut borders at the earliest sign of trouble despite desperate accusations he was being alarmist and “xenophobic.” No. Mr. Biden is anything but a fighter. He would never do anything to upset his minders and masters along the Potomac, be they in the Democratic Party or in the press. Mr. Biden is nothing if not obedient and pliable. A Potomac pushover, bobbing for approval. There is another lesson to learn from these past few Democratic primary contests, as well. Despite all the Twitter hysteria and spinelessness among Democrat leaders in Washington, it turns out that regular voters even in the Democratic Party are not actually ready to turn to socialism. That’s a good sign. Quite possibly you have something more in common with your loony sister-in-law after all. Or maybe not. This, of course, should have been obvious to any adult from the beginning. Can you imagine if Democrats had, instead of washed-up Joe Biden, fielded a reasonable, likable and sane candidate last summer who crashed every early debate by demanding what in the hell happened to the Democratic Party? A candidate who refused to raise her hand when asked if she was in favor of giving free health care to illegal immigrants? A candidate who proudly embraced the legacy of former President Barack Obama? Forget the so-called “moderate” lane. Just run in the “adult” lane. Democrats could have fielded a much better candidate who was an actual fighter. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com or @charleshurt on Twitter.",Charles Hurt — The Obedient Mr. Biden: Pliable Joe a Model Beltway Candidate,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/charles-hurt-the-obedient-mr-biden-pliable-joe-a-model-beltway-candidate/,Breitbart
"Job Creators Network president and CEO Alfredo Ortiz urged Congress on Friday to send a relief package to President Donald Trump’s desk with short term loans and payroll tax cuts that will help small businesses thrive in the wake of the coronavirus. “Based on what we are hearing and on news reports, the current House bill being negotiated will be a poison bill for small businesses, leaving small business stranded in the midst of a crisis,” Ortiz said in a statement on Friday. “Cash flow is the name of the game for small business owners right now. What is needed are short term loans and payroll tax cuts that are key to helping small businesses weather this storm, avoid furloughs and keep their doors open. The federal government needs to provide expedited federal unemployment insurance to employees as a safety net for those affected,” Ortiz continued. On Friday, President Trump addressed the nation in the Rose Garden and declared a national emergency that would free up $50 billion to fight the spread of coronavirus. President Trump also announced a plan to waive student interest payments on federal loans and other economic incentives. “A tax credit for paid leave in twelve months isn’t going to help with cash flow now if revenues aren’t coming in the door,” Ortiz said. “Any bill that doesn’t include these short term measures will be nothing more than window dressing and an attempt to exploit a crisis for check the box political gain.” On Friday, Job Creators Network ran a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal USA Today, and, the New York Post with the message, “Small Business is Too Big to Fail.”  Jerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know. Order your copy today.

"Friday on “TMZ Live,” former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said the Democratic Party has to unify behind former Vice President Joe Biden because defeating President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election is a matter of “life or death” in light of his administration’s coronavirus response. Host Harvey Levin asked, “Are you worried that Bernie Sanders supporters are not going to support Joe Biden?” Buttigieg said, “That why it is so important to remember what is at stake here. Saying you are not going to vote for Joe Biden is saying you are not going to vote for higher minimum wage. It’s saying you are not going to vote for an expansion of health care in this country. It’s saying you are not going to vote for real action on climate change. Look, I get that we each are passionately committed to our candidate. I was passionately committed to me being the nominee until I saw it was time to step aside.” “But the distance between us between even the most different of the Democratic contenders and the president we have right now —who by the way right now is responsible for keeping the American people safe and it’s not happening,” he continued. “This is literally life and death.

"President Trump announced Friday that he has enlisted the help of some of America’s biggest companies to contain the spread of coronavirus in the United States, in an “all-of-America” approach. The corporations include Walmart, Walgreens, Target, CVS, and other major companies. Trump introduced and thanked the companies’ leaders individually during a press conference in the White House Rose Garden. “They are simply celebrities in their own right. They’re the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world,” he said. Doug McMillon from Walmart said the White House has asked them to make portions of their parking lots available in select locations so that people can do drive-through testing for coronavirus. “When we got the call yesterday from the White House, we were eager to do our part to help serve the country. And given what we are facing, that’s certainly important to do. We should all be doing that,” McMillon said. Richard Ashworth from Walgreens is ready to engage and help. He said: We are happy to stand in here and help in communities all across America because a lot of times when we have natural disasters, our stores are a beacon in the community and the situation is no differen. So we look forward to partnering with the CDC, the administration, HHS and the task force and specifically to the Vice President doing such a fantastic job. Brian Cornell from Target said the company is committed to keeping its stores open to serve American consumers who are stocking up on household essentials and key food and beverage items. He said: Along with our colleagues from Walmart and Walgreens and our partners at CVS, normally the you’d view us as competitors, but today, we’re focused on a common competitor, and that’s defeating the spread of the coronavirus. We look forward to working with the administration to do our fair share to alleviate this growing threat. Tom Polen from Becton Dickinson, one of the leading providers of medical devices as well as collection products for testing of coronavirus, said the company is ramping up its manufacturing capacity to “ensure that the right collection devices and testing equipment are ready to address this issue.” Stephen Rusckowski from Quest Diagnostics said the company is working with other companies, the FDA, and the CDC, and is “up and running” with testing in a number of facilities. He said: As the President mentioned we now have capabilities from Roche Diagnostics that we will bring into our facilities this weekend and I know myself, my colleagues at LabCorp will be doing the same so the capacity of available to the American public to support this action with consumers will be considerably increased in the next few weeks. Matt Sause from Roche Diagnostics thanked the FDA for their rapid approval of their coronavirus test. He said: We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible because it is critical for us to make that available to help patients in need and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future which will bring hundreds of thousands of test available to patients in need in the United States. David Pierre from Signify Health, the largest house care provider in the U.S., it would go to the homes of the most vulnerable elderly and through its network “stand ready to help and provide our clinicians to be where they are needed whether they are in retail clinics or in the home and we are here to assist.” Adam Schechter from LabCorp said the company is “working every second of every day” to increase the number of tests that can be run. He said: We are working with academic medical centers with our colleagues at Qwest with other hospital and other laboratories to ensure that we do everything we can to increase the testing as we move forward and I can tell you we understand how important the testing is and we are committed to doing everything possible. Thomas Moriarty from CVS said the company is “committed to working with the administration and local public health officials to make this work as well.” Bruce Greenstein from the LHC Group said the company would work to test Americans who cannot get to a test site in their homes. He said: We are very proud to be part of the equation for testing in their own home. For Americans that can’t get to a test site or live in rural areas far away from a retail establishment we are here to help and to partner with our hospitals and physicians as well as the people we have here today that will be doing testing around the country. Vice President Mike Pence also hailed these companies for stepping up and working on combating the coronavirus: These are companies that are synonymous with communities large and small where people come together and now they are going to come together to meet the needs of the American public. These commercial laboratories, LabCorp and Quest and Roche have just done an incredible job stepping forward and they are going to literally make — literally make hundreds of thousands of test available and being processed with results to patients in the very near future. “Every American should be proud of this incredible public-private partnership that is going to be speeding the access of testing to millions of Americans in the weeks ahead,” he said. “Together we will get through this, together we will put the health of America first.”",Trump Enlists Help of American Companies to Stop Coronavirus Spread: ‘All of America’ Approach,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/trump-enlists-help-of-american-companies-to-stop-coronavirus-spread-all-of-america-appproach/,Breitbart
"Hollywood stars hurled insults at President Donald Trump and spread false claims during his latest coronavirus press conference at the White House Rose Garden, where the president declared a national emergency and announced measures that sent the major stock indices soaring late Friday. Celebrities called President Trump an “asshole” and a “moron” on social media as he announced his administration’s plan to free up $50 billion to fight the spread of coronavirus. The president also put forth economic incentives, including waiving student interest payments on federal loans. The Hollywood elite also used their influencer roles to spread fake news to their millions of social media followers about the conference and the president’s response to the global outbreak. Author Stephen King falsely claimed that the president’s coronavirus team is “all male, all old, and all white.” But at Friday’s press conference, at least two women spoke to the media, and one was a woman of color — Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who is part of the White House’s coronavirus response team. Note that Trump’s coronavirus team is all male, all old, and all white. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 13, 2020  Actress Bette Midler continued to spread the false claim that President Trump called the coronavirus a “hoax.” The president used the word “hoax” at a recent campaign rally to describe the Democrats’ attempts to politicize the illness and hurt his administration.

"Saturday during an interview with MSNBC’s Al Sharpton, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), a member of the liberal congressional foursome known as “The Squad,” argued now may be the time to commute sentences of some federal prisoners given their vulnerability to coronavirus. Pressley said she and other congressional Democrats were lobbying the Bureau of Prisons for “compassionate” releases. “[W]hen we are talking about our most vulnerable, our low-income residents and those experiencing homelessness, our seniors and that we are also including the incarcerated men and women, who are amongst one of the most vulnerable populations and given the crowding and overpopulating in our prisons for a confluence of other reasons we won’t get into in this interview, Rev., buy you are certainly well aware of, are an ecosystem and a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic, which is why I partnered with my colleagues, Representatives [Nydia] Velázquez, [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez and [Rashida] Tlaib, to lobby the Bureau of Prisons to use their full power to communicate guidance for how we will contain and mitigate this epidemic behind the wall.” “Specifically, do they have access to testing? Secondly, has anyone tested positive, and what are the quarantine measures? Again given the overpopulating and the fact that many of these facilities are already subpar and that incarcerated men and women do not have access to soap, to alcohol-based hand sanitizers — and to regular showers, what is the guidance for those incarcerated and for staff? And that the B.O.P. Use their full powers, I think now would be the time to commute some sentences, to exact clemency and to take care of our most our vulnerable. Ten percent of those incarcerated are over the age of 60 and already have an underlying condition.

"The Pentagon has halted all domestic travel for troops, Defense Department civilians, and their families assigned to bases and other facilities within the U.S. and its territories, beginning March 16 through May 11, in order to halt the potential spread of the coronavirus, the department announced Friday. That domestic travel includes permanent change of station (PCS) — or moving to a new assignment, and temporary duty (TDY) — temporary assignments in different locations, the Pentagon said in a statement on Friday. Troops will be authorized local leave only. The restriction will also pause civilian hiring at Defense Department installations and components for persons who did not reside within the hiring entities’ local commuting area. Exceptions may be granted for compelling cases where the travel is mission-essential, for humanitarian reasons, or warranted due to extreme hardship, the Pentagon said. Approval would have to come from a combatant commander, a service secretary, the Pentagon’s chief management officer, or the director of the Joint Staff, but could be delegated. Also beginning Friday, the Pentagon building located in Arlington, Virginia, raised its health protection condition from low to moderate, or “Bravo,” and began implementing additional protective measures that would dramatically cut the number of visitors to the building as well as its supporting facilities. The measures apply to those who do not have swipe-access cards to the building already. The Pentagon is also implementing minimal staffing, by having personnel telework or rotate beginning on Monday. A senior defense official told reporters on Saturday during a conference call: Over the last few weeks we’ve been testing our ability to move our personnel on to telework and starting Monday, many offices will voluntarily go to minimal staffing. This may involve additional telework as well as rotating staffing — red and blue teams to limit cross interaction. Officials said individual offices are making decisions about what functions can be performed via telework and what must be performed at the workplace. Those who need to access classified materials for mission-essential functions will still come into the workplace, they said. In addition, visitors without access — including international partners and visitors — are also restricted. The Pentagon has also canceled all public Pentagon tours, major events, retirement ceremonies, promotion ceremonies, and swearing-in ceremonies. The Pentagon’s gym is also closed, as well as some of the Defense Department’s other gymnasiums. Access to the Pentagon’s retirement homes is also restricted, due to the coronavirus’s heightened risk to the elderly population. Access has also been restricted for Pentagon employees — government civilians or contractors — who have been overseas recently, particularly in one of the Level 2 or 3 countries as defined by the Center for Disease Control. Those employees should self-isolate for 14 days. Currently, ten service members have tested positive for coronavirus world-wide, but there is no information indicating that any of them had come into the Pentagon.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.","Pentagon Orders 60-Day Domestic Travel Restrictions for Troops, Employees, Families",2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/pentagon-orders-60-day-domestic-travel-restrictions-for-troops-employees-families/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House announced on Saturday evening. “Last night after an in-depth discussion with the President regarding COVID-19 testing, he elected to proceed. This evening I received confirmation that the test is negative,” White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a statement released via White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. “One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free. I have been in daily contact with the CDC and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation.” The announcement comes hours after President Trump revealed at a press briefing addressing his administration’s latest measures to combat the coronavirus that he underwent testing for the deadly illness and that the results were pending. “I also took the test last night, and I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking, ‘Did I take the test?’” he told reporters. Vice President Mike Pence announced at the briefing that the United States to expanding its European travel ban to include the United Kingdom and Ireland and that it will take effect at midnight on Monday. “Americans in the U.K. or Ireland can come home. Legal residents can come home. But as the secretary will detail, they will be funneled through specific airports and process,” he explained. President Trump took the test after dining at Mar-a-Lago last weekend with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, who tested positive for the coronavirus. On Friday, Bolsonaro tested negative for the disease that originated in Wuhan, China. Earlier Saturday, the White House began conducting temperature checks for reporters “in close contact” with President Trump or Vice President Pence. “Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere confirmed in a statement. McClatchy White House correspondent Francesca Chambers reported that “around 11:30 am a man in a suit with a no contact thermometer came through the White House press briefing room and workspaces, taking the temperature of reporters in the building.” As of Saturday, 2,400 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus and 50 people have died from the illness, reports the New York Times.",White House: Donald Trump Tests Negative for Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/white-house-donald-trump-tests-negative-for-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Republicans face a political “extinction event” if they are viewed as blocking economic relief to Americans financially harmed by the coronavirus outbreak, warned economist Alan Tonelson, founder of the economics and public policy website RealityChek, during a Friday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin. Mansour asked what policy measures could assist contractors and others in the “gig economy.” “I think [emergency relief packages] will help and in this regard — I think that Congress’s Republicans are simply going to have to hold their noses and vote for a bill that contains a great many programs that in normal times they understandably wouldn’t like, because these aren’t normal times.” Tonelson added, “It seems very clear to me that Republicans and conservatives faced a genuine extinction event back in 2007 and 2008, when not only didn’t they anticipate a truly menacing housing and credit bubble that was building up that various others were warning about, but when those bubbles burst they seemed paralyzed because of this extreme anti-government ideology that had swept over the entire party and nearly the entire conservative movement.” LISTEN:  Tonelson continued, “It’s almost like the way that Republicans failed to react to the Great Depression back in 1929, ’30, ’31, when they also faced something of an extinction event because they simply couldn’t get off that ideological diet.” “There’s no doubt that this House Democratic bill is also full of a lot of items that have nothing to do with the virus,” Tonelson cautioned, “but if the Republicans don’t want to be branded as public enemy number one, again, they’ve got to swallow their pride, they’ve got a swallow their ideology, and get with this program.” Asked about a payroll tax holiday’s utility to contract employees who are unemployed due to the coronavirus’s economic fallout, Tonelson estimated, “[A payroll tax holiday] might help them in one sense. It might help them in that their employers might be able to carry them on their payrolls, even though, again, I realize that that these are part-time contracting jobs, but they might be able to to come to some arrangements with them to keep money flowing to them without going bust themselves.” Tonelson continued, “But I do think that because these jobs are so irregular, some kind of direct government income support is going to be needed. Maybe it would be some kind of tax holiday for individuals. It could take any number of forms, and I don’t think it’s especially important what exact form it takes. What’s important is that Washington moves now and gets that money flowing.” Mansour asked about a temporary “universal basic income” measure to provide financial relief to Americans economically damaged by the coronavirus’s impact. “Certainly conservatives and small government types are not crazy [about this],” replied Tonelson, “[they] fear that these kinds of temporary programs could too easily become permanent programs, but frankly, that’s a problem for down the road. We have to get past this, what I think will be a short- or medium-term crisis, and conservatives and Republicans cannot afford to be depicted, rightly, as standing in the way, even if they don’t have the votes in the House, which they clearly don’t.  American workers are not to blame for the coronavirus outbreak, Tonelson stated. “The value of individual responsibility — which conservatives rightly prize and which everybody else should prize more — it just doesn’t apply now,” determined Tonelson. “This is not these workers’ fault. They’re not in this predicament because of some personal failing, [or] because they themselves didn’t uniquely didn’t anticipate this virus.

"After failing to verify the account of Republican congressional candidate Anna Paulina Luna, despite a pledge to proactively verify all congressional candidates, Twitter went even further by temporarily restricting her account earlier this week. The restriction occurred shortly after she retweeted a post from Diego E. Arria, a critic of Venezuelan socialism who was formerly the country’s permanent representative to the UN, and president of the UN Security Council. The tweet featured a picture of Luna, a U.S. air force veteran, wearing her military uniform along with a rifle and a sidearm. The tweet is currently flagged as “sensitive content” by Twitter.

Twitter is aware that Luna is a congressional candidate. The platform has said it will verify all primary candidates in U.S election races this year, provided they have a Ballotpedia page — which Luna does. Despite being notified numerous times by Luna’s campaign, Twitter still has not verified her account — and is now being locked out of it for reasons Twitter won’t publicly explain. Twitter has not commented on why Luna’s account has not been verified, or why Arria’s tweets were labeled “sensitive.” In a comment to Breitbart News, Luna alleged that Twitter was tacitly assisting the socialist regime of Venezuela by censoring Arria, one of its most prominent critics. “Twitter has activity chosen to promote socialist politicians and censor those who believe the best form of government is a constitutional republic. Maduro is a dictator who has hurt many people and destroyed Venezuela.” “By Twitter censoring myself & the former UN Security Council President simply because he was promoting my campaign as a Republican to the people of Venezuela is alarming. I lost many three friends during my time in the military.

"CNN and other media outlets are accusing President Trump of lying when he said that Google is developing an app to help those who have potentially contracted the Wuhan Coronavirus get tested. “Google is going to develop a website — it’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past — to determine if a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” President Trump said at a press conference yesterday. “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They have made tremendous progress.” CNN is now implying that the President’s comments are fake news. “Google will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference,” claimed CNN. “Instead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients.” It is true that the triage app is being launched by an Alphabet subsidiary, Verily, but many people still use “Alphabet” and “Google” interchangeably. YouTube, for example, is still widely described as a “Google-owned company,” despite the fact that it is now technically owned by Alphabet, which was set up by Google executives in 2015 as part of the tech giant’s corporate restructuring. In a tweet, Google confirmed that Verily is working on a triage app that will first be trialed in California. “We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing,” said the statement. “Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time. We appreciate the support of government officials and industry partners and thank the Google engineers who have volunteered to be part of this effort.” Google’s statement that it hopes to expand the tool more broadly over time is not as optimistic as Trump’s claim that it will be “very quickly done.” But in all other regards, it confirms Trump’s statement — the tech giant is working on a screening tool, it is being supported by government officials in its efforts, Google engineers have volunteered to work on it (it’s unclear if the number is 1,700) and it does hope to make the tool broadly available. In a statement to CNN, the White House reiterated that it is working with Google on the screening tool. “The Trump administration is working with Google to develop a website Americans can go to determine whether a test is needed and, if so, facilitate testing at a nearby location. We expect to have more details in the days ahead.” Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.",Media Accuses Trump of Fake News over Google Screening Tool Claim,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/03/14/media-accuses-trump-of-fake-news-over-google-screening-tool-claim/,Breitbart
"National pro-life leaders praised President Donald Trump and his administration for rejecting proposals to the coronavirus supplemental bill that would force American taxpayers to fund abortion. .@realDonaldTrump thank you for not allowing the abortion industry to use #Coronavirus relief to push for taxpayer-funding of abortion! — Kristan Hawkins (@KristanHawkins) March 14, 2020  On Friday night, Trump announced his support for the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to assist Americans affected financially by the spread of the coronavirus. Trump had initially expressed his opposition to the bill, stating it had too many unrelated “goodies” that Democrats were trying to stuff in the bill. On Thursday, the Daily Caller reported that White House officials indicated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to ensure a Hyde Amendment loophole was included in the economic stimulus bill. The Hyde Amendment is a longstanding provision applied to spending bills that states taxpayer monies will not be used to fund abortions. According to the report, a White House official said Pelosi tried to lobby for a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which would not have the Hyde Amendment protections applied. The official reportedly stated A new mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented. Under the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion—which is not only backwards, but goes against historical norms. Planned Parenthood attacked the concern that taxpayer funds would be used for abortions as a result of the coronavirus spending bill. The abortion giant complained: Using this very real public health emergency to attack abortion coverage shows a despicable lack of concern about the severity of this crisis.

"The federal government is directing nursing homes to bar visitors amid the coronavirus epidemic, President Donald Trump said in his March 13 press conference. A key tactic is “breaking chains of transmission between people,” Trump said in his Rose Garden speech amid a bevy of business leaders in the retail and medical sectors. “We’ve issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places but in particular nursing homes,” he said, adding: The risks to young and healthy Americans remain very low. So we’ve learned a lot about this over the last two weeks. Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions, and those who are most at risk. They have not done very well. … Especially if they have a health problem, they have not done well. We must take all precautions and be responsible. “As you get older, your immune system is not as potent as it is when you were young,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the press event. He continued: When you talk about even influenza — which we have extraordinary experience with over decades and decades — the people who are very vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlying conditions. The same thing holds true for a variety of other disease: Why cancer is more prevalent mostly in older individuals [is] because the immune system that screens for it is less robust. So it really is something that is kind of well-known over a lot of studies. Data from China reportedly shows very low death rates from people younger than 50. But the death rates among people older than 70 hit 9.8 percent, while the people older than 80 suffered an 18 percent death rate, or almost one-in-five. Roughly 30 million Americans are older than 70. Business Insider reported March 11: Before the coronavirus hit the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, 120 seniors lived there. Now there are fewer than 50. The long-term care facility, about 20 minutes north of Seattle, has been battling a coronavirus outbreak for weeks.

"During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) laid out policy priorities for combatting the coronavirus, such as allowing people to obtain testing without cost, guaranteeing two weeks of paid sick leave to all employees, and providing protective gear to healthcare workers. Transcript as Follows: “Hi, I’m Senator Patty Murray from Washington state. Right now I know families in my state and across the country are alarmed by the continued spread of the novel coronavirus. Like so many of the families I’m hearing from, I have been incredibly frustrated and concerned by the Trump Administration’s missteps and slow response to this crisis so far. People need the facts. They need a plan. They need transparency. And they need it now. So I’m working to make sure we not only hold the Trump Administration accountable for the delays and missed opportunities so far, but that we also do everything in our power to immediately take the steps we need to do to start to finally get ahead of this crisis. I know so many people are asking what they should be doing to help keep their family and community safe. The most important thing we can do right now is make sure each and every one of us is taking steps to slow the spread of this virus so we can protect the people who are most vulnerable and prevent a spike in cases from overwhelming our health care workers on the frontlines. Public health experts have made clear this is something everyone can, and must, play a role in. There are several simple, straightforward steps you can take starting right now to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases: avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth and avoid close contact with people who are sick; clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, and throw that tissue in the trash; wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; and if you are sick—stay home. We should also all be taking steps to improve social distancing to protect ourselves and others in our communities. Now these steps may seem small—but make no mistake, they are a critical part of this fight. The other critical part of this effort is ensuring we’ve got a coordinated, comprehensive government response that puts the needs of families, workers, and communities on the frontline of this crisis first. Here are the next steps Democrats believe are necessary. First, we need to make sure that no matter how you are insured, or whether you are insured—you can get testing at absolutely no cost. We need to ensure all employees have access to fourteen paid sick days immediately, so they can afford to follow the CDC’s advice and stay home if they are sick. Our health care workers need protective gear to keep them safe as they care for those who are sick. And we need to make sure our schools have plans for everyone who will be impacted by the difficult decisions they may have to make. Children who rely on school for nutritious meals, college students who get their housing, medical care, and meals on campus will need our support. We also have to support our communities in addressing the needs of people experiencing homelessness and those experiencing food insecurity. And, as coronavirus continues to impact our small businesses, we will absolutely need to put policies in place that help local economies recover. There is much more we need to do as well—but steps like these will go a long way toward saving lives and reducing the impact of coronavirus—and we need to take them as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we’re going to keep pushing to get done. Let me also say that I know this is a frightening time, and there are lots of unknowns. But here are two things you can count on: First, you can make a huge difference for yourself and others by following public health experts’ guidance on ways to slow the spread of this virus. Small steps truly do save lives in this moment. And secondly, Democrats understand the urgency of this moment in no uncertain terms—and we are going to work to do everything we can, as fast as we can, to protect you, your loved ones, and all our communities. We are in this together, and we will get through it together.

"Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton is walking back her claim, made last week, that the state has 100,000 people who have the coronavirus. Screenshot/Johns Hopkins coronavirus website According to medical experts tracking the virus, there are currently 153,523 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide.  Confirmed cases in Ohio total 14, with no deaths reported. “I am not saying there are absolutely for certain 100,000 people, I’m saying I’m guesstimating,” Acton said at a news conference on Friday, according to the Hill. Acton drew swift reaction on Thursday when she said at a press conference with Gov. Mike DeWine that she estimated there were 100,000 people in Ohio with coronavirus, based on the fact that the virus is spreading in the community. Acton said at the time: We know now, just the fact of community spread, says that at least 1 percent, at the very least, 1 percent of our population is carrying this virus in Ohio today. We have 11.7 million people. So the math is over 100,000. So that just gives you a sense of how this virus spreads and is spreading quickly. The Hill reported on the controversy: Tara Smith, a professor of public health at Kent State University, said Friday she thinks Acton’s number is “too high,” but said that there could be 1,000 undetected cases in Ohio right now. On Friday at the press conference, Acton said once there is better data, modelers would go back and see if she was right. “As modelers far smarter than I am put that together, we’ll look back at this and we’ll see where we were,” Acton said.

"MADRID (AP) – Spain´s government is set to announce Saturday that it is placing tight restrictions on movements and closing restaurants and other establishments in the nation of 46 million people as part of a two-week state of emergency to fight the sharp rise in coronavirus infections. The Associated Press has access to the draft of the battery of measures that Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will announce in a nationally televised address. According to the draft of the government order, people will only be allowed to leave their homes to buy food and medicine, commute to work, go to medical centers and banks, or take trips related to the care for the young and the elderly. Those limitations will take hold at Monday at 8:00 a.m. Effectively immediately, Spain is also closing all restaurants, bars, hotels, education centers nationwide, and other non-essential retail outlets, a move some of the hardest-hit communities have already carried out. The government said that the official measures to be taken are open to last-minute changes before the prime minister details them in his address. Health authorities in Spain said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people, half of them in the capital, Madrid. That represents a national increase of over 1,500 in 24 hours. Lancet Editor-in-Chief: Boris #Coronavirus Strategy 'A Grave Error' https://t.co/BXLJefIIb0 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Sánchez acknowledged on Friday that the number of infections could reach 10,000 in the coming days. Spain has followed Italy´s path in implementing a similar lockdown after both European countries failed to contain the virus in regional hotspots. Italy extended the strict restriction on movement from the north to the entire country on March 9 when it registered over 9,000 infections. It then went further on March 11 and closed all retail outlets except some supermarkets and pharmacies. Already in Spain, residents in Madrid and northeast Catalonia awoke Saturday to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities the day before. The decision by prime minister Sánchez comes after some regions of Spain with viral clusters had taken steps to close restaurants and other non-essential establishments. The regional leaders of Madrid and Catalonia had also asked for the central government to help tighten the screws on transport and restrict the circulation of people. The normally bustling streets of Spain´s two biggest cities were noticeably quieter as the message sinks in that social distancing is the only way to stop the global pandemic after its eruption in China. “We had to close and remain shut for 15 days,” restaurant owner Rachel Paparardo said in Barcelona, Catalonia’s largest city. “But this is nothing, it is just so more people don´t get infected and we can recover from this.” Spooked shoppers packed some supermarkets early in the morning despite calls for calm from authorities and supermarket owners. In the capital, however, the town hall was forced to close parks after many people continued their Saturday morning jogs and other outdoor pastimes. “I live in the city center and I like to see it empty,” said Madrid resident Carmen Melon. “I like to see that I think people are being responsible and the people who have to stay at home are doing it. Today I have to work, just one hour, but later I will stay home too.” Authorities and public health care workers, as well as television and radio news anchors, are making pleas for people to stay at home in order to reduce the spiking contagion curve. Authorities in parts of southern Spain have also blocked access to coastal areas in an attempt to stop people who had taken advantage of the closing of schools this week and “work from home” options to take impromptu beach trips. A state of emergency allows the central government to limit free movement, legally confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals. It’s only the second time that the government has evoked it since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

"An Obama-appointed federal judge blocked a Trump administration rule that would have tightened work requirements for food stamps, citing the coronavirus pandemic as the reason she made her decision. D.C. District Court Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell granted a preliminary injunction blocking the recent Trump administration rule on food stamps, which the USDA estimates would have reduced federal spending by $7.9 billion over five years and gradually weaned 755,000 people off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program in charge of food stamps. “Especially now, as a global pandemic poses widespread health risks, guaranteeing that government officials at both the federal and state levels have flexibility to address the nutritional needs of residents and ensure their well-being through programs like SNAP, is essential,” Howell wrote in her ruling, according to HuffPost. A 14-state coalition, two major cities, and the Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia have all sued the Trump administration over its rule to stop states from providing food stamps to long-term unemployed residents. Under the “able-bodied” provision in the rule, Americans who are not caring for a dependent younger than six years old would only be eligible for food stamps if they are employed or enrolled in a workforce training program. “The waivers that the Rule curtails are critical to ensuring access to food for low-income people who live in areas with limited employment opportunities,” read the complaint filed by the 14 states and New York City and Washington, DC. “If implemented, the Rule will have a drastic impact on Plaintiffs and their residents by depriving between 688,000 and 850,000 vulnerable Americans of much-needed nutritional assistance.” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said last year that this rule laid “the groundwork for the expectation that able-bodied Americans re-enter the workforce where there are currently more job openings than people to fill them.” However, while the Trump administration’s initial rule meant to cut the number of food stamp recipients, President Donald Trump struck a deal with House Democrats that included paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing, and money for food stamps, the Washington Post reported.

And very accurate, I think.” Overall, the president stressed the “overriding goal” of stopping the spread of the virus and helping “all Americans impacted by this.” Sanders, meanwhile, has been delivering near-daily updates on the coronavirus and using the opportunities to plug his vision for a universal health care system. “Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,” Sanders said on Thursday, making similar remarks on Friday. “Poll after poll already shows us that the American people understand that we must do what every other major country on earth does, and that is to guarantee health care to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege,” he said on Friday. “As we begin to see the failures and vulnerabilities of the current health care system, my guess is that those numbers, and the demand for universal health care, will only go up,” he added:",Bernie Sanders Calls for Construction of ‘Emergency Housing’ over Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/bernie-sanders-calls-for-construction-of-emergency-housing-over-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"The coronavirus is an economic emergency. But it does not have to become an economic catastrophe. It is very likely to push us into a recession, if it has not already. The signs of economic contraction are plain enough to see: major sports and cultural events have been canceled, airlines have curtailed their flights and been swamped with cancellations, Apple stores are closing, schools and museums are shuttered, movie productions are halted, the stock market has had its worst two weeks since the financial crisis, and you have very likely already canceled that trip you had planned for spring break. Nothing else needs to happen for the economy to slip into recession. That’s why I say we may already be in one. To some, it will seem extraordinary that the economic impact could be so severe even though we only have a few thousand confirmed cases of coronavirus. But the social distancing we are undertaking to limit the toll of the virus on human lives entails a huge downturn in our economic activity. On a society-wide basis, we’re suddenly buying less and working less. Demand and supply are falling. It has been thrilling to watch the people of our shining Republic rise up in a largely spontaneous and voluntary social movement to contain the virus. Businesses have voluntarily told workers to stay home, sports leagues have sacrificed profits for public health, landlords in New York are promising to forego foreclosures, colleges have taken instruction online, churches are taking measures to avoid becoming vectors of infection, and families have adopted infection-fighting hygiene regimes. All without orders from governmental authorities. America has always been a rugged nation of people determined to improve our lot. And one thing that has been clear these past two weeks is this: we still got it. Right now we stand at the economic crossroads. It’s a time for choosing. Down one path, we allow the economic emergency to become an acute crisis. People who lose their jobs–and that’s inevitable given what has already happened–will stop spending on all but the necessities, struggle to live off all-too-meager savings and pragmatically skinflint jobless benefits meant to spur them back to work at the earliest opportunity. That will ripple through the economy, triggering more layoffs, more businesses closing, and even less economic activity. Think of this as stage one of the economic infection. To take just one quick and obvious example: all the weddings planned for the next two months are being canceled. Couples are putting off one of the biggest days of their lives because of the virus. This has a potentially enormous impact on them and also on our economy. The florists, caterers, and people running event spaces are losing their incomes and jobs. Travel arrangements are canceled, so are hotel reservations, dinner reservations, honeymoon plans–and that will cost many hardworking Americans their jobs. And just as the rational response to the virus means that behavioral changes go much broader than infection, the rational responses to the coronavirus economic emergency will be much broader than the frontline cost to the economy. People who are still working will pull back on spending to save their income for the bad times ahead, investment funds will flee risk assets for safe assets, and new business plans will be put on hold until we recover. Since every dollar spent into the U.S. economy is someone’s income, lower spending means lower incomes.  This path of rational fear threatens to push us into severe recession territory. Stage two of the economic infection gets very bad, very quickly. We panic save ourselves into poverty. Remember when Disney shuts down its productions, the guys holding the boom mics lose their jobs and their incomes. When Broadway’s theaters close, the guys with hammers and nails who build sets are out of work. Contractors lose jobs because people drop home improvement plans. Waitresses can’t collect tips from empty diners. Factories get fewer orders for appliances, machinery, cars, and workers get hours cut. Some lose their jobs. College kids get job offers rescinded because companies need to rein in their spending when sales decline. Though no fault of their own, and without much warning, American families get thrown into crisis. This is not something that is going to happen to strangers. It’s going to happen to your friends, your neighbors, your coworkers, and the people in your church’s pews. It’s going to happen to you if we choose to go down the path of coronavirus catastrophe. Fortunately, there’s another path. For all the surprise and shock that many of us are experiencing at the idea that our economy and society can be derailed by disease–it feels like we’ve been thrown back into the pre-modern Dark Ages–the coronavirus gives us economic policy advantages we rarely have: we know exactly what the problem is, we can see it happening right in front of us, and it is not due to excesses that need to be wrung out of the system through liquidations and rearrangements of the economy. This isn’t a dot com bubble, it’s not the mortgage bubble, it isn’t some inflationary spiral we need to stem. In other words, we know what’s happening. Even better: we know what to do about it. We need to put cash into the hands of the American people as quickly as possible. I propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending. This will not stop all the job losses but it will make them less painful. More importantly, it will make it far less likely that we go from stage one to stage two. It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects. We could accomplish much of this through a payroll tax cut but that becomes less likely to be effective every day because it only helps the working. A week ago, I told the Trump administration that this would be a crucial and effective measure. But now the cost of social distancing has become even clearer and I am convinced this would not be adequate. You can’t cut the payroll tax of someone who gets cut from the payroll. And, in any case, the House Democrats we need to pass any emergency measures have rejected the sort of payroll tax cut they fought for when Obama was president. What we need to do now is just start cutting checks for everyone. We need to go deep and broad. The checks go out to hardworking American families who have jobs, workers who lose their jobs, stay at home moms and dads, young people, and old. And, yes, even some of the deadbeats who do not really deserve them. But that latter category is pretty damn small and paying off a few undeserving people is a small price to pay for stopping the economic ruin threatened by coronavirus. There will be some who would prefer to see the government attempt to raise demand in the economy by engaging in big public works projects such as repairing our ailing infrastructure. We do not have time for that. Nothing is shovel ready. And it would fail to get the cash where it needs to be: in the hands of American households all over the country. Others will worry about the precedent set by a huge program of government “handouts.” But the usual objections to such things do not apply here. There’s no moral hazard risk, no rewarding people for bad behavior, or socializing the costs of risks undertaken for private gain. This isn’t the launch of a big government spending program or a new welfare system. It’s just a temporary series of cash payments that the private sector will be free to use as it chooses. Instead of big government, American families will decide what to do with the cash. If it helps, think of this as a refund on the taxes we’ve paid all these years that have helped build our government into one of the few institutions in the world that can undertake this kind of spending in an economic emergency. Can we afford it? The financial markets have already delivered the answer and it is an emphatic “yes.” Interest rates are incredibly low. Long-term rates are the lowest they have been in the history of our country. We have plenty of “fiscal space” to borrow right now. There’s no reason to fear deficit spending now. Just as it makes sense to refinance your mortgage and withdraw some equity if cash is tight and rates are low, it makes sense to borrow now to support the economy. This is something like a cash-out refinancing of the American economy. It’s rare that an economic emergency comes with so much warning and with such an obvious remedy. We know what needs to be done and we know it needs to be done now. History will look back on us as the generation that took a stand against the coronavirus or the generation that let it bring us down. I say we take our stand.",Carney: How To Respond to the Coronavirus Economic Emergency,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/14/carney-how-to-respond-to-the-coronavirus-economic-emergency/,Breitbart

"A law firm that employs Joe Biden’s brother as a top adviser is demanding billions from China in a class action suit over coronavirus. The Berman Law Group, which employs Francis, or Frank, Biden as a “senior adviser,” on Friday “filed a federal class action lawsuit against the People’s Republic of China, Hubei Province, the City of Wuhan, and several Chinese government ministries, on behalf of residents and businesses in the United States and the State of Florida,” according to a news release from the firm. The lawsuit, which was filed in Florida, “seeks billions of dollars in compensatory damages for those who have suffered personal injuries, wrongful deaths, property damage and other damages due to China’s failure to contain the COVID-19 virus, despite their ability to have stopped the spread of the virus in its early stages.” It is not clear how the firm calculated the amount of damages demanded from the communist regime. “This is an ambitious complaint against a world super-power,” Russell Berman, co-founder of the firm, said in the news release. “But, as we have alleged, China has unleashed a pandemic upon the world, and the harm is now exponentially multiplying every day here in the U.S. and Florida — our firm isn’t afraid to take them on and get the justice that is deserved. It is the Chinese government that should be paying damages for economic stimulus to the United States not the American People.” A staffer for the presidential campaign of Frank’s brother recently said President Trump “decided” to let coronavirus get “out of hand” in the U.S. It is not clear if that allegation will weigh against the accusations made by the Berman Law Group. The firm hired Frank Biden in 2018, according to an announcement on its website. Berman said Biden was “highly regarded in the business and government sectors.” He is featured with three other stern-faced fellows on the front page of the firm’s website. In seeking victims to represent in the suit against China, the firm states, “The Berman Law Group looks forward to fighting for the rights of people and businesses across Florida and the rest of the country, who are now becoming sick or caring for loved ones, dealing with financial calamity, and navigating this new world of panic and social distancing and isolation.” Peter Schweizer, Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute president, details in his latest investigative work, Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, Frank Biden’s history of shady business dealings. As Breitbart News reported: Frank Biden first set his sights on the region in 2009, as the Obama administration began to repair the U.S. relationship with Costa Rica. Tensions between the two countries flared under President George W. Bush, most notably on how to deal with drug trafficking. When President Barack Obama entered the White House, he set out to mend fences in the region in hopes of inaugurating a new era of global cooperation. Leading the charge on that front was Joe Biden, who had long standing ties to the region from his tenure leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Shortly after the new administration took office, Frank Biden began scouting real estate opportunities in Costa Rica. A lawyer by training, Frank was undeterred by his lack of background in international development and decades old legal troubles at home. As Schweizer notes, despite the professional and personal handicaps, business opportunities were plentiful for Frank, especially after his brother paid a visit to the country. “Costa Rica News announced a new multilateral partnership ‘to reform Real Estate in Latin America’ between Frank Biden, a developer named Craig Williamson, and the Guanacaste Country Club, a newly planned resort,” Schweizer wrote. “In real terms, Frank’s dream was to build in the jungles of Costa Rica thousands of homes, a world-class golf course, casinos, and an anti-aging center.” According to Schweizer, Frank Biden also capitalized on the school choice movement by building charter schools. An educational option, incidentally, Joe Biden recently said he would eliminate. “He realizes is that there’s not much money to be made in running charter schools. The money is to be made in the real estate of charter schools. So basically he gets involved with investors, they buy properties, and then they lease these to charter schools. And charter schools, using taxpayer money, are essentially paying off their leases,” Schweizer told Breitbart News Daily. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) is experiencing a double-digit lead in Ohio just days before the state’s March 17 primary, an Emerson College/Nexstar Poll released on Friday showed. The survey, taken March 11-12, 2020, among 464 “very” likely Democrat primary voters, showed Biden taking a comfortable lead in the Buckeye State, with 57 percent support to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 35 percent support — a 22 point advantage. While the majority of respondents, 78 percent, indicated that they will “definitely” vote for who they chose, over one-fifth of voters said they made their decision within the last week. Per Emerson: Forty-one percent (41%) of voters say they made up their mind about who to support in the primary over a month ago, 28% say they had decided in the last month, 21% decided sometime in the last week, 7% in the last three days, and 4% say they had decided just today. Voters who made their decision in the last week have split 67% for Biden, and 23% for Sanders. Voters who made up their minds in the last month are leaning towards Biden at 58% to Sanders at 39%, and voters who made up their minds before that are for Biden at 46% and for Sanders at 47%. The margin of error is +/- 4.5 percent. Ohio, which offers 136 delegates, is one of four states holding elections on Tuesday.

"Grandpa Joe Biden wants to run the country and save us from coronavirus when he can’t even run a livestream and has no idea what year it is. On Friday, Grandpa Joe held what his campaign billed as a “virtual town hall” in Illinois. In my colleague Kyle Olson’s must-read reporting on the event, you will discover the whole thing was a fiasco, like something out of a sitcom. Guests appeared and then disappeared. The sound was garbled. People were introduced, followed by an awkward pause when they didn’t appear. Babies cried… “Biden seemed to be reading from a teleprompter, but the broadcast suffered from severe tech issues, as Biden’s words were caught in a feedback loop, muddying the whole presentation and making the candidate nearly indecipherable,” Olson reported. After starting two hours late, the fiasco lasted about 45 minutes. For my money, this clip from The Honeymooners, where Ralph and Ed attempt to do a live television commercial, is the funniest thing ever captured on film. Sounds like Grandpa Joe just took that crown. Technical difficulties, however, are technical difficulties. That doesn’t mean those technical difficulties are not newsworthy. After all, we are talking about a major presidential campaign, about the competency, or lack thereof, of the people hand-picked by Biden to run his campaign. So it is a bit disconcerting that Joe and his staffers were unable to put on the equivalent of a video podcast, something millions of everyday Americans are able to do every day in their basements without a hitch. But what about Joe’s performance? How did the 985-yead-old Democrat frontrunner do? The media tell us that any criticism of Grandpa Joe’s mental acuity is a hoax, is fake news, is a desperate and desperately unfair personal attack… And then this happens: In a bizarre, meandering livestream put on by Joe Biden's campaign today, he forgets what year it is and when, if he doesn't lose, he would be in office. At another point, he seemingly forgets he's on a live stream and walks out of frame.

The date of the livestream was March 13, 2020. The presidential election will take place in November of  2020. The next president will be sworn in in January of 2021… Did you get that? Would you like me to type it again slower? “Even I can’t do that for another two years.” No. There are only ten months between now and the next inauguration. “…another year, between now and November.” No. There are only eight months between now and November. “…or actually January.” Why don’t we warm you up some oatmeal and see who’s guest-starring on Matlock with that nice Andy Griffith today? And then Joe shuffles off to watch Matlock while rambling on about estuaries and international species. Watch the full virtual town hall here:

"The Sanders campaign is beefing up its presence in Pennsylvania despite the widespread belief that his political revolution is losing steam. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign on Friday announced the opening of five offices in the Keystone State ahead of its April 28 primary. However “the campaign quickly warned they may not stay open for long, given a shift to more digital organizing prompted by the coronavirus pandemic,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “Pennsylvania voters have the power to move this movement forward, and we’re fighting for every vote over the next six weeks,” Sanders’ Pennsylvania state coordinator Brooke Adams said, according to the paper. Sanders, once considered the Democrat frontrunner, began to lose momentum after losing ten states to Joe Biden (D) on Super Tuesday — a happening that unfolded in the 72 hours between South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday as establishment Democrats made their moves. Sanders suffered another batch of losses during the March 10 primaries, including Michigan, the biggest prize of the night. He lost to Biden by over 16 percentage points but told supporters the following day that he would remain in the race and looked forward to debating his “friend” one-on-one on Sunday. “Today I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country, and you must speak to the issues of concern to them,” he said in his address, touting his popularity with younger generations. “You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older,” he added. The Vermont lawmaker admitted in an address on Friday that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is affecting his campaign’s ability to interact with voters in a traditional way. He said his staff is “by and large” working from home but added that it is utilizing its Internet capabilities to reach voters. He also said it is “absolutely appropriate” for local officials to follow the guidance of public health experts and postpone elections if it is in the best interest of the public health. He said: So all I would say is I think that the governors and the officials in the states that are — that have elections scheduled for Tuesday — have to balance things. Again. Rescheduling elections is not something we do lightly or should do lightly. On the other hand, at this particular moment, it’s absolutely appropriate that public officials, governors, etc. listen to public health officials. And your point is also important, to make sure that everybody that wants to vote has the right to vote and that may be the case today. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin confirmed on Friday that the state will postpone its April 4 elections for roughly two months amid coronavirus fears. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania State Rep. Kevin Boyle (D) is introducing a bill requiring officials to mail every eligible voter a mail-in ballot: PA needs to be realistic about the Apr 28 election. We don’t know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens & election workers alike. With this in mind I’m introducing a bill today to require all voters to be mailed a ballot. — Rep. Kevin J. Boyle (@RepKevinBoyle) March 12, 2020  “I think this is, unfortunately, a once-in-a-lifetime crisis that we’re facing,” he said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “If that were to unfold, you’re talking about a situation where I think it would be unrealistic to have in-person voting on April 28,” he added. He believes the legislature must move on the bill quickly and warned that, if it does not pass, “it becomes a realistic option that we don’t have a primary on April 28.”",Bernie Sanders Beefs Up Staffers in Pennsylvania as Movement Spirals,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/bernie-sanders-beefs-up-staffers-in-pennsylvania-as-movement-spirals/,Breitbart

"The editor-in-chief of The Lancet has labelled Boris Johnson’s coronavirus strategy “a grave error” and published an open letter asking for the models informing his policy to be made publicly available, along with a number of other prominent medical figures. Besides delaying local and mayor elections scheduled for this year until 2021, Johnson’s government had implemented few policies to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus as of March 13th, instead simply advising citizens to regularly wash their hands. Instead, it appears the Government wants large numbers of people to become infected with the virus, in hopes most will recover and confer “herd immunity” on the population before the coming winter, when they expect it to be more dangerous. This stands in stark contrast to policies adopted by countries such as Mongolia and Russia, which began restricting travel from China and other infected countries early — on and consequently have few cases at the present time — or the likes of South Korea and Italy, where the virus has become prevalent and the authorities are attempting to slow its spread through the imposition of strict quarantine and “social distancing” measures, in hopes this will stop their health services from being overwhelmed by too many people becoming ill all at once. Boris Johnson’s government did not suspend travel from any country stricken by the coronavirus, has not imposed mandatory testing and self-isolation for travellers, and has not banned mass gatherings, with government minister Whatley telling the BBC: “As the Chief Medical Officer said, and I have been advised, the evidence tells us that stopping mass gatherings doesn’t have a huge impact on the spread of the virus”. This approach has caused considerable disquiet — the Government has now indicated it may ban mass gatherings from next week after all — and has now come under fire from Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet — arguably the world’s most prestigious medical journal. What troubles me about the UK govt’s response to COVID-19 is its strategic objective. The goal seems to have been herd immunity, delaying urgent action to allow an epidemic to infect large numbers of people. Instead, the goal should have been to save lives. A grave error. — richard horton (@richardhorton1) March 14, 2020  “What troubles me about the UK govt’s response to COVID-19 is its strategic objective,” Dr Horton wrote on social media. “The goal seems to have been herd immunity, delaying urgent action to allow an epidemic to infect large numbers of people.

A grave error.” He also said it was a “myth” that “the public will tire of restrictions to their freedoms” — a supposition which is said to have strongly informed the models the Government is using to time its implementation of containment measures. “In fact, the public acted to socially distance, avoid mass gatherings, and work remotely ahead of govt advice,” Horton observed. “The govt has underestimated the public’s capacity to understand and act.” He has also written an open letter, published by The Times, urging the Government to make its modelling publicly available, given its strategy is “demonstrably different from most countries’ responses globally and in Europe.” “[I]t is imperative to delay and ‘flatten’ the epidemic curve to ensure the NHS can cope,” Horton’s group wrote. “This is particularly essential for the UK, which (according to OECD data) has 2.5 hospital beds per 1,000 population, behind Italy (3.2), France (6.0), and the U.S. (2.8)… [W]e request that the Government urgently and openly share the scientific evidence, data, and models it is using to inform its decisions on the [coronavirus]”, they urged. Dr Nisreen Alwan, associate professor in public health at the University of Southampton, Dr Miriam Orcutt, senior research fellow at University College London’s Institute for Global Health, Dr Anne Wilson, lecturer in epidemiology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Dr Peter Tennant, university academic fellow in health at the University of Leeds, and Devi Shridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, signed the letter alongside Dr Horton. Please read and support our letter in The Times today calling on the UK government to share the evidence, data, and models on which it is basing its policies.

"Pennsylvania state lawmaker Rep. Kevin Boyle (D) is urging his colleagues to consider his bill requiring the state to mail a ballot to every eligible voter as key businesses and industries across the United States continue to take drastic, proactive measures to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. While Pennsylvania’s primary elections are over a month away (April 28), Boyle is thinking ahead and believes the state needs to prepare for the possibility of the virus having an impact on the state’s elections. His solution is a bill that would require the state to send every eligible voter a mail-in ballot. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, his bill would “set aside $40 million for ballots to be sent in ‘postage prepaid, pre-addressed return envelopes,’” serving as a safeguard to the possibility of the cancellation of the in-person election. “PA needs to be realistic about the Apr 28 election,” he said on Thursday. “We don’t know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens & election workers alike”: PA needs to be realistic about the Apr 28 election. We don’t know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens & election workers alike.

Boyle (@RepKevinBoyle) March 12, 2020  It is extremely hard to fathom PA having in person voting on April 28. We are either going to have to go exclusively to vote by mail or push our primary date back. https://t.co/SCREu75HFS — Rep. Kevin J. Boyle (@RepKevinBoyle) March 13, 2020  Boyle called the pandemic a “once-in-a-lifetime crisis that we’re facing,” adding, “If that were to unfold, you’re talking about a situation where I think it would be unrealistic to have in-person voting on April 28.” “I think legislatively we have to move on this next week or the week after to have a primary in late April,” he told the paper. “If this bill doesn’t pass, it becomes a realistic option that we don’t have a primary on April 28.” More via the Inquirer: Pennsylvania is also having “comprehensive discussions” about the primary, including the Department of Health, the governor’s office, the General Assembly, and county officials, according to Wanda Murren, a spokesperson for the Department of State, which oversees elections. “Our focus is on best ways to protect the integrity of the election while safeguarding public health,” said Murren, pointing voters to the state’s new mail-in ballot option, which does not require an excuse for not showing up at a polling place. The news comes as the state officials consider the potential impacts the virus could have on upcoming primary elections. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin confirmed on Friday that the state is postponing its April 4 primary elections. He said in part: The health and safety of Louisiana residents is critical, and we want to do our part to prevent the spread of this highly infectious disease. One key stakeholder in our decision is our election day polling commissioners. Over half of Louisiana’s polling commissioners are over the age of 65, and the CDC warns that the older adults; people who have serious chronic medical conditions such as: heart disease, diabetes or lung disease are the people most at risk for serious illness from COVID-19. “We have requested postponing the April 4 Presidential Preference Primary and Municipal Primary until June 20 and postponing the May 9 General election until July 25,” Ardoin announced.",Pennsylvania Lawmaker Promotes Vote by Mail for Primary: Coronavirus Could Make In-Person Voting ‘Unrealistic’,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/pennsylvania-lawmaker-promotes-vote-by-mail-for-primary-coronavirus-could-make-in-person-voting-unrealistic/,Breitbart
"Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists, increasingly overshadowed by the coronavirus, have been discussing new and ever more desperate ways to grab attention for their next big publicity stunt. Mooted tactics include: committing suicide in public (perhaps at the UN’s next climate summit in Glasgow later this year); hunger strike to the death; painting parliament green; spraying traffic lights black; blocking every station, airport, and motorway in Britain; and “scare the fuck out of people”. These are among the actions proposed on a leaked XR discussion document titled ‘Vital Additions to Action Strategy.’ They appear in a list under the heading ‘Top Ideas from the Sessions.’ The radical ideas seem to be a response to concerns within XR that the public have grown slightly bored with or even irritated by their antics. For example, the protests in October last year when XR activists were filmed being pelted with missiles and dragged off a tube train in London by angry commuters trying to get to work, is described in XR discussion documents as “arguably problematic for the movement” and “alienating”. This, the document explains, is because “at the present time, we simply do not have the numbers needed to achieve our goals through mass civil disobedience.” Extinction Rebellion has been conducting interviews with journalists to find out which of their stunts play well with the media and which don’t. Their conclusion:  Unpopular actions were seen to alienate the public and the press. Positive, “funny” actions were overwhelmingly preferred to “doom and despair”. A major impression from the interviews was that occupying London again will generate less media interest, unless it is a) substantially bigger or b) cleverer – “sitting in the road is not enough now”. Clear targeting and creativity are seen as essential for driving us forward. There is no evidence of any XR member having actually volunteered to commit suicide or go on hunger strike in order to save the planet. And the document concedes that “highly sacrificial actions” have been vetoed up until now because of “strong pushback from the movement”. What’s clear, though, is that there are elements within Extinction Rebellion who think that suicide and similar “highly sacrificial actions” are just what the cause needs. In addition, as the Climate and Ecological Emergency becomes more dangerous every day, we must encourage more extreme actions to achieve meaningful change. This movement must not become ineffectual and forget its rebellious heart as it grows. Extreme self sacrificial actions can act as a vanguard for the movement, inspiring people in their rebellious journey and focusing the world’s attention. However, these highly sacrificial actions have suffered so far due to their lack of organisation / cohesion of message and because of strong pushback from the movement. For such high-risk actions, action design must be slick and highly considered. It also seems necessary for the movement to clearly outline in any strategy going forward, the intention to encourage more extreme action in response to genuine growing crisis so as not to face pushback from the movement as a whole every time a highly sacrificial action takes place. One of the problems XR may face, however, in their desperate attempts to ramp up the green scare narrative is the stiff competition they now face from the coronavirus pandemic.
 As more and more real people suffer and die as a result of the very clear and present danger posed by the actual virus, the public may rather lose patience with the fake news scare of man-made climate change.  he public might also begin to wonder why they ever viewed these unwashed middle-class hippies with third-rate degrees in environmentalism and poi studies with such indulgence.  ",Delingpole: Kamikaze Greenies – Extinction Rebellion Plots Suicide Stunt,2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/15/kamikaze-greenies-extinction-rebellion-plots-suicide-stunt/,Breitbart
"(AFP) — Passengers on the Golden Princess cruise liner were barred from disembarking at a New Zealand port on Sunday because of a suspected coronavirus case on board, health officials said. There were 2,600 passengers and 1,100 crew on the boat docked at Akaroa near the South Island city of Christchurch, according to the port’s cruise ship schedule. New Zealand’s director-general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said three passengers have been quarantined by the ship’s doctor. One of them has developed COVID-19 symptoms and is being treated as a suspected case. “All on board are not being allowed off the ship until results are known,” Bloomfield said. The health scare arose just three days after Princess Cruises announced it was suspending voyages worldwide for two months in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The company is allowing cruises within the last five days of their journey to complete the trip, but said cruises ongoing as of March 17 would end early at the most convenient location. Princess Cruises has already seen two of its vessels hit by the virus and quarantined: the Diamond Princess, which docked in Japan, and the Grand Princess, which docked in California. Bloomfield would not be drawn on what would happen to the Golden Princess until results of tests on the three passengers were known on Monday. The Golden Princess was already in New Zealand waters before Wellington on Saturday banned all future cruise ship arrivals until June 30 under strict new coronavirus related regulations. A New Zealand public health specialist, Brian Cox from the University of Otago, said if coronavirus was confirmed on the Golden Princess then the remaining passengers should not remain on board. Coronavirus: Cruise Ship Carrying 3,700 Quarantined After Infection Outbreak Aboard https://t.co/t4xwFLCU4q — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2020  The decision to quarantine 3,700 passengers and crew on board the Diamond Princess in Japan was heavily criticised after more than 700 people eventually tested positive for the virus. “The Japanese experience was a sad lesson that keeping people aboard such a ship just spreads the infection through a large number of people, and the boat becomes, basically, an incubator for spread of the disease,” Cox said. Removing passengers from the ship and placing them in self-isolation for two weeks was the safest option, he added, and it would be “inhumane to just turn it around and send it back”. On Saturday, New Zealand said international travellers would have to self-isolate on arrival for 14 days, with similar measures also announced by Australia on Sunday.

"Schools are being shut down. Workers are being sent home from offices. Universities are telling their students not to return to campus. Political rallies are being called off. People are staying indoors. All of these moves represent a boon for the Masters of the Universe in Silicon Valley. In the year of the pandemic, connection to the internet and to online services has never been more useful. While work-from-home arrangements, online classes, and online political activity have all enjoyed significant growth over the past decade, the Wuhan coronavirus is switching those trends into overdrive. Over the next few months, many will discover the convenience of working from home. Students will wonder why they need to fly out of their hometowns to faraway colleges when they can do everything they need from a laptop. Politicians will realize that they can reach far more people, with much less effort, by holding a virtual townhall in lieu of a rally. Unless you fail as badly as Joe Biden, this will be a plus for a candidate’s campaign. And what about elections? In Britain, local and mayoral elections have been postponed by a year because of the Wuhan Virus. That’s a nice free year in office for left-wing London mayor Sadiq Khan, but if elections being pushed back becomes the new norm, voters of all parties will start to wonder — why can’t we vote from our laptops and smartphones? There’s nothing inherently wrong with a rapid shift into the digital sphere. It may well make our lives more efficient and convenient. There’s just one problem — the technologies you’ll be using will be controlled by Silicon Valley. Voting from home may sound prudent during a global pandemic. But what if the voting software is controlled by Microsoft? Do you trust Microsoft? This is a company whose former board member, Reid Hoffman (also co-founder of LinkedIn) funded a Russian-style digital election interference campaign in the 2017 Alabama senate runoff. Virtual townhalls are great if you’re a Democrat candidate, but not so great if you’re a Republican. Then you can expect to be covertly “shadowbanned,” denied verification, have your campaign ads banned on YouTube and Facebook, and in the case of candidates like Tommy Robinson and Laura Loomer, banned from social media platforms altogether. Big Tech platforms already had a huge and growing influence on politics. With rallies and political events getting canceled, that will only increase — putting banned candidates like Loomer at a colossal disadvantage. Her campaign has already canceled a drive to collect signatures for ballot registration due to the coronavirus pandemic, opting to pay a registration fee instead. What happens when a political candidate can’t do physical campaigning or digital campaigning? Ordinary citizens who are banned from major platforms will also run into trouble. If politicians start holding townhalls using platforms like Facebook Live and Periscope, how will citizens who are banned from those platforms ask them a question? Worse, if elected officials use the big tech platforms to broadcast important information about the coronavirus or other crises — as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis did during Hurricane Dorian last year — how are citizens who’ve been banned from those platforms supposed to find out about it? If you’re staying indoors to escape a pandemic, chances are you’ll be making more online purchases than normal. If you’re self-employed, you might want to start selling your products and services online. But that becomes significantly harder if you’ve been banned from PayPal or Stripe or even denied a bank account for political reasons. With governments warning you to stay inside, you might alleviate your boredom by playing online video games. Unless XBox Live or other gaming platforms have banned you for using mean words, that is. Missing your social life? Well, at least you can use Facebook and Twitter to talk to your friends. Oh wait — unless you’re banned. Dating? Don’t worry, there are apps for that. Unless you get too political — then you’ll be banned there too. Afraid to go to the grocery store? You can order food on Uber Eats — unless Uber’s banned you for “hate speech.” Is your lecturer holding his seminars on Facebook live? Sorry, you can’t participate, Facebook’s banned you! All of this assumes, of course, that people are being banned for concrete reasons, and not due to faulty algorithms, which happens all the time. Facebook and other social media platforms sometimes correct those mistakes. Sometimes. They don’t, after all, have a massive incentive to do so — losing one user isn’t much of a financial blow, and thanks to the legal immunities of Section 230, no user has yet been able to successfully sue a platform for wrongful termination of their account. The Wuhan coronavirus could have Americans staying indoors for weeks, maybe even months. It could force us to move large parts of our everyday lives online, accelerating pre-existing trends. Except that some people, because of arbitrary and politically biased censorship from the tech giants, won’t be able to. With government turning to the private sector, including tech giants, for help tackling the crisis, perhaps the nation’s leaders will finally be forced to seriously confront the fact that for many Americans, access to digital platforms is fast becoming not merely a luxury, but an essential need. Big Tech can no longer be allowed to take it away on a whim.

"On Sunday, March 15, 2020, Breitbart News spoke with Jerry Wayne, the auto worker Joe Biden cursed as “full of shit.” Wayne told Breitbart News that after Biden cursed at him, he knew more blunders would follow, saying “I was going to let him dig that hole.” Jerry Wayne told Breitbart News he wants to hold Biden accountable for the words he says, as they related to prohibiting firearms, and he wants to do so in such a way to make it “political suicide to even mention taking one of our rights away.” On March 10, 2020, Breitbart News reported the exchange between Biden and Wayne, an interaction that began with Wayne expressing his concern that Biden planned to take guns away from Americans. Biden responded to Wayne’s concern by saying, “You’re full of shit.” But the exchange continued, with Wayne continuing to stand his ground and Biden resorting to asking Wayne if he wanted to go outside to referencing “AR-14s.” Wayne told Breitbart News that he was not shocked when Biden cursed at him. Rather, he said what shocked him was that Biden stopped to engage with him in the first place. Wayne said that once Biden cursed he know bigger blunders would follow, so he said, “I was going to let him dig that hole.” Wayne said, “As soon as he said I was full shit, I knew he was going to go back on what he said in his earlier videos. So I just wanted to let him talk, because I knew he was going to dig that hole. He did this to himself.” Later on March 10, 2020, Breitbart News reported one of the Biden videos Wayne is referencing. The video is from an August 2019 CNN interview, the Real Clear Politics transcription of which shows that Anderson Cooper asked, “So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they’re going to come for guns?” Biden responded, “Bingo. You’re right, if you have an ‘assault weapon.’ The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.” While speaking to Breitbart News, Wayne added, “I am not Democrat or Republican, I’m an American.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union” that the United States “only hope”  to stop the coronavirus outbreak is if the federal government “realizes we’re in a war and takes over the situation. Host Brianna Keilar asked, “The president made several claims on Friday that the White House later had to clarify. Are you getting clear information from the White House, from the Trump Administration?” De Blasio said, “No, Brianna, we haven’t for so long. On January 24, I held a press conference at the emergency management office, calling for the federal government to support us with localized testing. We didn’t get the ability to do localized testing until just about two weeks ago. We’re playing a huge game of catch-up in this country. Let me say it very bluntly. The federal government, at least in the last few days, has started to come alive and do something, but we are so far behind. We need massive testing all over the country, particularly in the affected areas. We need the federal government to take over the supply chain right now. Right now we have to make sure that the places in this country that need more ventilators, that need surgical masks, that need hand sanitizer, that that is a federalized dynamic where those factories that produce those goods are put on 24/7 shifts and those goods are distributed where they’re needed most as in wartime.” “Right behind that is the question of food and basic supplies,” he continued. “If the federal government r this is the equivalent of a war already, there is no way the states and localities can make all the adjustments we need to. I agree with Governor DeWine. I’ll reach across the aisle are we’re all on our own in so many ways, and I think mayors and governors are doing their best to quickly improvise, mobilize the cities, cancel elective surgeries. We cannot control the supply chain. We cannot control the foundation of where our medical supplies and equipment come from.

You do have schools close there can in Ohio for three weeks. I wonder if there’s a possibility that Ohio schools will be closed actually for the remainder of the school year. Is that possible?” DeWine said, “Absolutely. Absolutely. One, the projections—and again, this is all projections, I’m just going by what medical experts are telling us. You know, this may not peak until, you know, the latter part of April or May. We’ve informed the superintendents, while we’ve closed schools for three weeks, that the odds are this is going to go on a lot longer, and it would not surprise me at all if schools did not open again this year.” He added, “When we closed the schools, we wanted to make sure kids continue to get food so the department of agriculture gave us a waiver within 24 hours so we could take food out to kids and distribute it in different areas, and some school districts in Ohio will take that out, put it on a bus and travel around and distributing it.

"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said on Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union” that the United States could see hundreds of thousands of fatalities if we do not stop the community spread in the coronavirus outbreak. Anchor Brianna Keilar asked, “There have been estimates of hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. who could die or, in the worst-case scenario, millions. Can you tell the American people that that is possible?” Fauci said, “You know, it’s possible because when you do a model, you have a worst-case scenario, the best-case scenario, and the reality is how you react to that will depend where you’re going to be on that curve. So obviously we are clearly going to have more infections. There’s going to be more problems with regard to morbidity and mortality. The challenge we have right now is how do we blunt that. I’ve said many times if you just leave it alone and let the virus to its own devices, it will go way up and come down naturally over a period of several weeks. Unfortunately for our colleagues in Italy and France and certainly in China, that’s what happened. Our challenge right now is to do two things, is to prevent the new influx of cases, hence the travel restrictions, and for what we’re dealing with right now, is to know that we’re going to get more infections but blunt it so that we don’t have that sharp peak, so we have a smaller hump. Even with that, we’ll have people getting infected, but we need to try to get there as opposed to there.” Keilar asked, “Are you thinking that hundreds of thousands of Americans could die from this?” Fauci said, “I say that, and it sometimes gets taken out of context. We have to be realistic and honest. Yes, it is possible. Our job, our challenge, is to try and make that not happen. But to think, if we go about our daily lives and not worry about anything, that it’s not going to happen, it could happen, and it could be worse. To me, that’s a real impetus to take very seriously the kind of things. I might make a point that people sometimes think that you’re overreacting.

"A new poll by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News finds that approval of President Donald Trump remains unchanged since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, though only 48% have confidence in him to manage it. The Journal reported Sunday morning: The survey of 900 registered voters found little sign that a crisis with potential to define the 2020 election has altered the political standing of President Trump. Some 51% disapprove of how he is handling the virus outbreak, while 45% approve. That is nearly identical to his overall job-approval rating, which is essentially unchanged from last month and from much of his tenure as president. Republicans and Democrats hold nearly inverse views on his emergency response, with 81% of GOP voters saying he has done well and 84% of Democrats saying the opposite. Among independents, 43% approve and 52% disapprove. … Fewer people in the survey said they had confidence in Mr. Trump to handle the crisis than they did in various levels of government. Less than half—48%—said they had a fair amount or great deal of confidence in the president. By comparison, 62% had confidence in the federal government, 72% in local government and 75% in their state government. The outbreak has taken governments around the world by surprise, and even those that have responded aggressively have been forced to re-adjust over time. On Saturday night, for example, Israel announced a ban on gatherings larger than ten people (ten is the minimum required for a prayer quorum in the Jewish faith). The Israeli government will also follow South Korea’s example in using private cellphone data to track those exposed to the virus. Joel B.

"PARIS (AP) – France is holding nationwide elections Sunday to choose all of its mayors and other local leaders despite a crackdown on public gatherings because of the new virus. Voting stations opened just as a drastic new order came into effect shutting down all of France’s restaurants, museums, and most stores to stem the spreading coronavirus. The country has some 4,500 cases, including 91 people who have died. President Emmanuel Macron decided against delaying the elections amid concerns that would be undemocratic. But the virus is expected to sharply reduce turnout. The government ordered unprecedented sanitary measures at polling stations. Organizers are under orders to allow a one-meter (about three-foot) gap between people in lines, and to provide soap or hydro-alcoholic gel and disinfectant wipes for voting machines. Voters were told to bring their own pens to sign the voting register. Associated Press reporters observed uneven application of the rules in different polling stations. Coronavirus: France Shuts Down Cafes, Restaurants, Cinemas, Non-Essential Retail https://t.co/zW1HZyJKFY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Sunday’s elections are the first round of a two-round election for leadership of all 35,000 French communes, some of only a few dozen inhabitants. Voters will choose among lists of candidates running for mayor and town council seats. If no list gets the absolute majority in the first round, all lists that receive more than 10% of votes will qualify for the second round, currently scheduled for March 22. While most voters cast ballots based on local considerations, the elections are an important gauge of public sentiment before the 2022 presidential election. Sunday’s voting is a tough challenge for Macron’s 3-year-old centrist party, which is competing for the first time in municipal elections and still lacks local roots across France. His government is also unpopular after months of protests from the yellow vest movement against perceived social injustice, and several weeks of strikes and demonstrations against a planned pension overhaul. The conservative Republicans party, the greens party, the populist National Rally, and the struggling Socialists are also vying for key mayoral seats and to strengthen or save their nationwide political bases. The main battleground is Paris, whose mayor is an influential figure in French politics and will oversee the 2024 Olympics.

"Elderly Britons may be told to self-isolate for four months under the government’s “wartime-style” effort to combat the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. The government of the United Kingdom is expected to impose a swathe of new measures to fight the further spread of the virus and to prevent the National Health Service (NHS) from “falling over” during the peak of the epidemic. Within the next 20 days, those over the age of 70 will be told to self-quarantine in their homes or care homes for up to four months, a Government source told ITV. Boris Johnson’s government is concerned that the quarantine will lead to the death of elderly people from neglect, and will call on friends, neighbours, and relatives to help older people during their isolation. Dominic Cummings, the chief advisor to the Prime Minister, has reportedly been reaching out to Deliveroo and Uber to help bring food to the elderly, as well. “We are looking for a huge community effort,” the source said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed that the imposition of self-isolation for the elderly is in the “action plan” — but added that the Government will not enact the plan until “it is the right time to do so”. “We absolutely appreciate that it is a very big ask of the elderly and the vulnerable and it’s for their own self-protection,” he told Sky News. AP Sources: U.S. #Coronavirus Travel Ban Extended to United Kingdom, Ireland https://t.co/Jzxo3rVHHn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Aside from the quarantine of the elderly, the Government is planning to enact temporary closures of public spaces such as pubs, bars, and restaurants, as well as banning mass gatherings. The Government is also planning to requisition private hospitals, hotels, and other buildings to aid its efforts against the virus. The measures are intended to prevent the nation’s socialised healthcare system from becoming overburdened, which could lead to rationing of care  — particularly for those over the age of 65, as has already begun in Italy, the epicentre of the European outbreak of the coronavirus. “Everything is aimed at making sure the NHS is not overwhelmed, to save lives and to prevent hideous choices having to be made,” a source said. The death toll from the virus reached 21 on Saturday, and over 1,140 people have been confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, according to the BBC. Lancet Editor-in-Chief: Boris #Coronavirus Strategy 'A Grave Error' https://t.co/BXLJefIIb0 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Next week the Government will introduce emergency legislation to combat the spread of the virus, giving the state the power to detain “any vehicle, train, vessel or aircraft” and the ability to close ports if there are “insufficient resources” in the event border security officials become sick, The Times reports. The emergency legislation will also empower the police to arrest and forcibly quarantine those who are sick but fail to self-isolate. “We are going to take the powers to make sure that we can quarantine people if they are a risk to public health, yes, and that’s important,” Mr Hancock said.

"CNN and other media outlets are accusing President Trump of lying when he said that Google is developing an app to help those who have potentially contracted the Wuhan Coronavirus get tested. “Google is going to develop a website — it’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past — to determine if a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” President Trump said at a press conference yesterday. “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They have made tremendous progress.” CNN is now implying that the President’s comments are fake news. “Google will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference,” claimed CNN. “Instead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients.” It is true that the triage app is being launched by an Alphabet subsidiary, Verily, but many people still use “Alphabet” and “Google” interchangeably. YouTube, for example, is still widely described as a “Google-owned company,” despite the fact that it is now technically owned by Alphabet, which was set up by Google executives in 2015 as part of the tech giant’s corporate restructuring. In a tweet, Google confirmed that Verily is working on a triage app that will first be trialed in California. “We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing,” said the statement. “Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time. We appreciate the support of government officials and industry partners and thank the Google engineers who have volunteered to be part of this effort.” Google later made their statement ever clearer: “Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information. (2/6) — Google Communications (@Google_Comms) March 15, 2020  Google’s statement that it hopes to expand the tool more broadly over time is not as optimistic as Trump’s claim that it will be “very quickly done.” But in all other regards, it confirms Trump’s statement — the tech giant is working on a screening tool, it is being supported by government officials in its efforts, Google engineers have volunteered to work on it (it’s unclear if the number is 1,700) and it does hope to make the tool broadly available. In a statement to CNN, the White House reiterated that it is working with Google on the screening tool. “The Trump administration is working with Google to develop a website Americans can go to determine whether a test is needed and, if so, facilitate testing at a nearby location. We expect to have more details in the days ahead.” Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.",Media Accuses Trump of Fake News over Google Screening Tool Claim,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/03/14/media-accuses-trump-of-fake-news-over-google-screening-tool-claim/,Breitbart
"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Govs. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) both said they are considering closing down bars and restaurants to help slow down the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Host Chuck Todd asked, “Are you thinking about shutting down bars and restaurants?” DeWine said, “We’re certainly looking at that. We started off last week closing the schools. We reduced the number of people gathered together to 100. You know, we restricted access to our nursing homes, to our prisons. So we’re taking tough steps.” He added, “I  have been consulting from Dr. Amy Acton who is doing a great job as my health director, but to national experts, they say look, every day counts so much. You cannot wait. You’ve got to move very, very quickly. And look, these are tough decisions. We’re inconveniencing people, making lives change, but we have to save lives.” Pritzker said, “What I’m telling you is we have been on the trajectory now and planning for each of these steps, because it’s not easy. You can imagine each one of these decisions has consequences to them that are not just about the pandemic, they’re also about people’s livelihoods. We’re actually looking hard at that decision making today. We obviously saw what happened in Europe.

"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D-IL) said President Donald Trump’s administration had “fallen down” on the response to the coronavirus outbreak. After international U.S. airports were crowded with returning Americans, Pritzker tweeted at President Donald Trump, “since this is the only communication medium you pay attention to—you need to do something NOW.” Host Chuck Todd asked, “Let me start with what happened at O’hare. You weren’t the only airport, but every international airport seemed to have a similar situation. Dr. Fauci seemed to say that is what is going to happen when you come back into this country. What do you believe should have been done that wasn’t done.” Pritzker said, “That’s not right. I have enormous respect for Dr. Fauci, but that’s just incorrect. We knew when the president gave the orders that European travel back to the United States was going to be cut off, that there would be an influx of people, Americans and others, that would come before the final cutoff. So what should have happened? They should have increased the customs and border patrol numbers. And they should have increased the number of CDC personnel on the ground doing those checks. They did neither of those. Last night, as people were flooding into O’hare airport, they were stuck in a small area. Hundreds and hundreds of people. And that’s exactly what you don’t want in this pandemic. So we had that problem. And then today, it’s going to be even worse. There are a larger number of flights with more people coming. And they seem completely unprepared.” Todd asked, “You have not gotten any reassurance from customs officials that they’re going to have more folks on hand today?” Pritzker said, “Well, here’s what I got. I got a call at about 11:00 last night after that tweet from a White House staffer who yelled at me about the tweet. That is what I got. Now, we have been talking to customs and border patrol officials directly on the ground at O’hare. I have been working with the mayor and our senators to make sure we’re getting the federal government to pay attention to this problem because we can’t have it happen all day today.” He added, “We had to provide the leadership because the federal government has fallen down on this. They didn’t advise us to shut down events. They’re not the ones who advised us to close down schools. We made those decisions on our own. We’re on our own. I wish we had leadership from Washington.

Respirators are the health care equipment health care workers need to treat folks and ventilators because if it gets really – this is one of the things with breathing issues for those that are elderly. What are your concerns? Has the federal government stepped up enough on this front?” Slavin said, “My concern is I think we need to think about this in almost a war-like stance. My concern is that we have millions of health care workers around this country who are prepared to do battle against this virus. But I’m concerned there are at least a couple areas of supplies they need in order to fight that virus as effectively as possible. One is the testing we need, and Dr. Fauci commented on that, and I hope indeed that private labs are going to ramp up testing. We started at mass general to increase our testing as of yesterday.” He added, “The FDA relaxed its regulations so we could begin testing immediately. My other big concern is personal testing equipment. Even before the most significant battles lie ahead, our supplies are low. I heard from hospitals around our region and our country that their supplies are low. And we need the federal government to engage in a Manhattan project, to get industry to create surgical masks, eye protection devices, gowns, sore our health care workers can engage in this battle.

"Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer Rubin argued there would be fewer Democrat coronavirus deaths because they are adhering to suggestions offered by experts and the media. In contrast, she argued Republicans are skeptical and more susceptible to death from the coronavirus.
“[T]here is a particular cruelty, irony that it is their core viewers, the Republican older viewers, who are the most at risk,” she said. “And when you think about it, which party immediately canceled all of their rallies? Which party immediately started having their political figures really portray and use their lives as an example? It was the Democrats. So typically, there will be less Democrat deaths because there will be less mass gatherings. There will be less opportunities for people to congregate and share this horrible disease. So it is really a very short-sided strategy. But I think now the name of the game is how do they get back on planet earth. And part of the way that I think that they are doing it is down the memory hole. He jumped right on this right away because of all this planning that we’re doing so well, which is head-spinning for the rest of us who watched him for weeks say this is a hoax. But this is how they do it at Fox News. “And so they will contort themselves to get in line and get in sync. And, you know, we’re always saying but, but, but, pointing to the past. And they don’t. They simply move with the flow. Every day is a new day. Every day is a new storyline, and they will stick with it. I think the problem will be what happens unfortunately if we start to follow that Italian model where we have mass casualties, and our lives are not disrupted for a week or two, but we’re talking months. And that is going to be some serious stuff. And I don’t know if their brainwashing is so strong as to carry on and make excuses for Trump during that.

"An El Cerrito, California, husband shot and killed an alleged intruder Saturday as his wife and daughter hid together in the bedroom for safety. The husband said the suspect “appeared to be trying to enter the home,” El Cerrito Police Capt. Robert De La Campa told the East Bay Times. “The male resident shouted at the intruder, who did not leave. The resident felt threatened that the intruder was going to enter the home and he felt he was acting in defense of himself and his family, so he shot at the intruder,” De La Campa added. The suspect, who was in his late 20s, fled the scene after the husband shot at him. He soon collapsed and police found his body in the street. KPIX5 reported that the mother and daughter were in the house at the time of the incident, and they “huddled together” in the bedroom while the husband went to investigate the noises. Police indicated the preliminary investigation supports the claim that the suspect was “in the process of committing a burglary.” They believe this same suspect may be tied to other burglaries in the area.

"Actor Bradley Whitford says the “cultish insanity” of President Donald Trump and Republicans who support him “might very well kill us all” as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across America. The White House has stepped up its efforts against the pandemic in recent days. On Friday evening, President Trump announced a ban on all travel from Europe, pledging additional funding, and launching a new federal coordinator to oversee testing. However, many figures across the political spectrum have been critical of the administration’s response to the pandemic. One loud Hollywood leftist most unimpressed was Whitford, who accused Trump of getting every decision wrong. “In our most harrowing moment, [Donald Trump] has gotten everything wrong,” the West Wing star said. In our most harrowing moment, @realDonaldTrump has gotten everything wrong. — Bradley Whitford (@BradleyWhitford) March 15, 2020  Whitford went on to say that Trump and his supporters are merely “racist science deniers” whose actions could get the whole country killed. “This is a moment to reflect upon the fact that [Donald Trump and his enabling GOP are racist science deniers whose cultish insanity might very well kill us all,” Whitford said.

In January, he responded to an escalation of tensions with Iran by suggesting that the children of Republican politicians replace U.S. military forces and be placed into combat. Last October, Whitford also declared Trump to be a “charlatan racist sexual assaulting useful idiot of Vladimir Putin,” despite the Mueller report effectively exonerating him of collusion with Russia.

"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” New York Times columnist David Brooks criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak by claiming that he does not “feel the emotions of other people,” which he said leads him to misread the country. Host Chuck Todd asked, “David Brooks, this was after the Wednesday address, Noah Rothman wrote, ‘There’s no excuse for the kind of carelessness in a prepared address to the nation. The cumulative effect of these errors and compromise measures was to leave the nation less confident than before the president spoke.’ The president might have been better off keeping quiet, but the point is it does seem as if that lack of confidence, and you start to see it, it’s spreading with different people on how to deal with this crisis.” Brooks said, “We see it with every fall official. None can get in front of President Trump, so they all have to hang back. I had a friend, somebody I care about deeply, call me last night and say he had a fever. I had no idea what to tell him. It was very unnerving. The next instinct is, I’m going to drive up and see him, but we can’t do that either. This goes against human nature that we can’t care for our loved ones. We have a president who doesn’t feel the emotions of other people. Therefore, he can’t read the country. Six months ago, he can’t say people are really hurting. They’re afraid out there. I have to act. He lacks that sense. He’s not really seeing the country. He’s reading what people think about him, which is all he sees.

"This follow-up to my March 12 coronavirus piece comes with the same important caveats, important enough that I’m stating them up front: I’m not here to alarm anyone, and I am not here to scoff. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I do know what our experts are saying, and this is me reporting what the experts are saying. Andrew Slavitt, Barack Obama’s former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is quoting experts who say more than one million Americans are already doomed because the “virus was not contained.” “Currently experts expect over 1 million deaths in the U.S. since the virus was not contained & we cannot even test for it,” Slavitt tweeted Thursday. “The original sin is Trump’s months long denial and his dismantling of public health and response infrastructure.” Let’s be very clear about what Slavitt is saying… AT THE VERY LEAST, ONE MILLION AMERICANS WILL DIE NO MATTER WHAT WE DO NEXT In no uncertain terms, using these experts, Slavitt is saying that it is already too late to save a million Americans, and that more than one million Americans will be dead in the next 12 to 18 months. He is saying that no matter what we do to contain and mitigate, no matter what we do going forward, it is fait accompli that more than one million Americans will die and that this is all President Trump’s fault. Let’s be just as clear about who Slavitt is… He is not some crank on Twitter. He is not some paranoid in a desert mobile home screaming from ham radio. Slavitt was appointed by the president of the United States to run CMS, and he did so for nearly two years. Slavitt’s name and reputation is such that his opinion on this matter rates mentions in the Guardian, Washington Post, and New York Times. Again, as I did in a previous piece laying out these terrifying estimates from America’s experts — the experts driving media coverage and by extension the government and corporate response that effectively shut down our economy last week — I want to make clear that I’m only here to report. Slavitt also quoted experts who said that American hospitals will be overrun by March 23. “By March 23 many of our largest cities & hospitals are on course to be overrun with cases,” he wrote. SLAVITT’S SOURCE IS EVEN MORE DIRE Slavitt is quoting a report (I noted in that earlier piece) that came from an “expert panel” (those are not scare quotes, that’s what the panel is called) that released a report highlighting the following…  [emphasis is original]: … Again, I want to be precise and clear… The report amplified by Slavitt declaratively says — and I am quoting here: “Our containment efforts won’t reduce the number who get infected in the US … 40-70% of the US population will be infected over the next 12-18 months. … [T]hat’s 160M people infected. With 1% mortality rate that’s 1.6M Americans die over the next 12-18 months.” In other words, we are already past the point of no return and 1.6 million Americans are simply going to die — nothing we do now will stop 1.6 million Americans from dying. That is the best case scenario, not the worst case scenario. THE MATH AVERAGES OUT TO 3,333 AMERICAN DEATHS PER DAY  As I did with my previous piece, I want to respect these numbers, but at the same time, I want to — within the world of these numbers — be as reasonable as possible. Slavitt says the best case scenario is “over one million” dead in the next 12 to 18 months. The report says the best case scenario is 1.6 million over the next 12 to 18 months. So I am going to do the math using 1.2 million over the next 14 months. Viruses ravage a population through exponential increases — which means more and more deaths over time. There is no way for me to predict that number and it would be irresponsible of me to try. So, in order to help us wrap our minds around that number, I’m going to break the math down into a daily average. Give or take a day or three, fourteen months is 420 days. That means 1.4 million deaths works out to an average of 3,333 deaths per day. To make that number clearer, between now and June of next year, according to these experts, an average of 3,333 Americans will have died every day. CONTEXT  Again, I am not here to alarm anyone, and I am not here to scoff… But context is important, so here is some context… Worldwide, since this outbreak began about three months ago, there have been (as of this writing), 160,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths. In the United States, since the CDC began tracking these numbers in mid-January, there have been 1,629 reported cases and 41 deaths. Now go wash your hands….   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Monday discussed his recent op-ed calling on action to be taken to fight the coronavirus after seeing the pandemic hit Italy. Gingrich praised Italy’s “strong response” to shut down schools, restaurants and churches after initially responding poorly in fighting the virus. “We really need to get in the habit of telling people we want you to be physically separate but stay in touch with each other, keep your morale up, remain social — in an electronic sense, not personally,” Gingrich outlined. I think two things happened here. One is they didn’t move as fast as they should have, and this is what President Trump’s trying to react to, I think. When the first wave hit the villages, I don’t think anybody thought they would spread as fast as they did. So, that was a challenge, the government’s now reacted very strongly.” He continued, “I would say Italians are more disciplined today than I’ve ever read about since the Roman Empire. It’s remarkable. You stand outside a store at a physical distance from each other, waiting for your turn to go in the store. And by the way, their stores are not empty. They are fully loaded, they have none of these problems of empty shelves. They’ve done a very disciplined, good job of that.” Gingrich also warned the United States could look like Italy if it does not take the right precautions, saying he hopes to see the country end up being more like South Korea with how it has combatted the spread of the disease. “This is a perfect moment for preventive care,” he emphasized. “If we get ahead of this, if we take the right precautions … if you’re careful about who you’re with I think that we have every chance to be closer to South Korea and to have learned a painful lesson from Italy.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Gingrich Hopes U.S. Learns ‘Painful Lesson from Italy’ — ‘We Have Every Chance to Be Closer to South Korea’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/gingrich-hopes-u-s-learns-painful-lesson-from-italy-we-have-every-chance-to-be-closer-to-south-korea/,Breitbart
"Google’s sister company Verily recently launched a website that invites adults in northern California to answer questions about their recent health and travel that could help them to receive a free coronavirus test.

President Donald Trump previously thanked Google on Friday for developing a website to help the public determine if they needed to take a coronavirus test.

The website states that Verily is working “with the California governor’s office to direct high-risk individuals to newly-launched testing centers in San Mateo and Santa Clara” counties. Individuals showing symptoms of the virus are urged to seek medical care rather than rely on Verily’s testing system, the firm stated. Verily did not respond to requests for comment on how many users had utilized the website in its first few hours. Verily stated that people’s survey responses would be kept in an encrypted Google database, access to this database is heavily restricted and monitored according to Verily. Verily stated that the data would be shared with healthcare authorities but would never be “joined with your data stored in Google products without your explicit permission.” Verily also stated that user-submitted data would be used for research purposes only with permission but it may ask for that permission in the future. The company did face criticism for requiring users to log in with a Google account, which does open the door to data privacy concerns. The coronavirus testing website by Verily can be found here.

"President Donald Trump condemned the press for spreading “fake news” about Google’s planned Wuhan coronavirus screening tool in a press conference Sunday. The President thanked google for confirming his announcement of the tech giant’s planned screening tool on Friday, and said that the leader of Google had called him to apologize. “I want to thank the people at Google and Google communications, because as you know they substantiated what I said on Friday.” “The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, called us and he apologized.” “I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace.” The President then held up a printed copy of Google’s press release. “As you know this is from Google, they put out a release, and you guys can figure it out yourselves,” said Trump, before casually flicking the press release towards the gathered reporters. “I’m sure you’ll apologize. It would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so wonderful.”  On Friday, President Trump announced that Google is developing a screening website to help Americans determine if they’ve been infected by the Wuhan coronavirus. However, CNN then put out a report saying that Trump’s comments were inaccurate. As Breitbart News reported: CNN is now implying that the President’s comments are fake news. “Google will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference,” claimed CNN. “Instead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients.” However, Google’s press release stated that after a trial in the San Francisco Bay Area, the company is aiming to roll out the tool more broadly. “Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information. (2/6) — Google Communications (@Google_Comms) March 15, 2020  The fact that Trump referred to “Google” rather than “Alphabet” does not make his comments inaccurate, as the two corporate names — the latter referring to Google’s parent company, established during a company restructuring — are frequently used interchangeably. YouTube is still frequently described as a “Google-owned company” even though it is now technically owned by Alphabet.

"In his ongoing effort to differentiate between himself and Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden is touting background checks but ignoring the fact they do not stop mass public attackers. On Sunday night Biden tweeted: Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times.  We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures. — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) March 16, 2020  While Politifact reports Sanders “did vote against the Brady bill, including a shifting mix of background check provisions, five times,” Biden is not addressing the fact checks have proven to be no hindrance to determined, mass public attackers. In fact, nearly every mass public attackers of recent memory–going back some 12 or 13 years–acquired his guns via a background check. Here is a short list of attackers who acquired their guns via background checks: The handful of mass public attackers who did not acquire their guns via background checks–attackers like the one who struck Sandy Hook Elementary School—got their guns via thievery, so no amount of point-of-sale gun control would have stopped them. This is important at a time when Democrats in the House and Senate, and the presidential primary race, are all pushing an expansion of background checks as crucial for American safety. On February 18, 2020, Breitbart News reported a John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study showing that expanded backgrounds do not reduce the mass shooting rate. Thus, whereas Democrats are fond of pushing even more background checks as a way of stopping future attacks, Johns Hopkins study found that expanded background checks are not “associated with lower rates of fatal mass shootings.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tested negative for the novel coronavirus, he announced in a statement on Sunday evening. “I was just informed by Dr. Moynihan, the head of the House Physicians Office, that my coronavirus test was NEGATIVE,” Graham announced on social media. “I’m very grateful and like everyone else will follow the best practices to stay negative.” “I look forward to getting back to work with my Senate colleagues and President Trump to contain this virus and stabilize our economy,” he continued, thanking people for prayers and well wishes: I look forward to getting back to work with my Senate colleagues and President Trump to contain this virus and stabilize our economy.

"A southern China community neighbourhood management office offered cash rewards to citizens for slaughtering “stray” or “unleashed” dogs during the coronavirus epidemic, according to an online news report. The gruesome incentive was included in a notice issued to residents of the Wanjiang Community in Dongguan, Guangdong province, in response to complaints about irresponsible dog owners, Kankanews.com reported. While the document dealt mostly with issues such as the need for owners to have a licence for their pets and to show consideration for other residents by keeping their animals on a lead in public areas and cleaning up after them, it also included a warning. That stated any dog seen within the grounds of the compound and not on a lead would be classed as a stray. And anyone who killed a stray was entitled to claim a reward of 200 yuan (U.S.$28) – once the death had been verified by a security guard. According to the South China Morning Post, the response to the proposal has been one of utter outrage and many who saw the notice were horrified. “It’s such a barbaric rule. It’s not what a civilised society should do,” a woman was quoted as saying. “If children see this, they won’t believe that they should love animals,” another said. Widespread fears of pets being able to spread the coronavirus disease began in January after a Chinese health expert claimed animals needed to be quarantined during the outbreak to stop the spread of the disease. However, the World Health Organization dismissed the claims suggesting there is no evidence to show the virus being transmitted to pets. The notice is now being re-drafted because “its content was inappropriate”, a spokesperson from the Wanjiang community, known by his surname Long, told Kankan News. “We wanted to regulate keeping pets. We are not encouraging killing dogs,” Long added. China’s relationship with “man’s best friend” has always been one of complexity with it being both a pet and something to be eaten. As Breitbart News reported,  the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen last month wanted local restaurants to take dogs and cats off their menus as the country clamped down on the wildlife trade scientists suspect led to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Reuters reports a new city regulation stated only nine meats that are permitted for consumption, including pork, chicken, beef and rabbit, as well as fish and seafood. “Banning the consumption of wild animals is a common practice in developed countries and is a universal requirement of modern civilization,” the notice said. Apart from dogs, the new Shenzhen act bars snake, frog and turtle meat from the dinner table.","Shoot Stray Dogs, Win Cash Prizes: How Chinese Officials Slaughtered Canines",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/16/shoot-stray-dogs-win-cash-prizes-how-chinese-officials-slaughtered-canines/,Breitbart

"The economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic was on clear display in the New York Fed’s Empire State Manufacturing Survey released Monday. This is the first piece of economic data to reflect the pandemic and it indicates a very heavy drag. General business conditions in the state have fallen to the lowest level since 2009. From the New York Fed: Business activity declined in New York State, according to firms responding to the March 2020 Empire State Manufacturing Survey. The headline general business conditions index fell thirty-four points to -21.5, its lowest level since 2009. The new orders index dropped to -9.3, pointing to a decline in orders, and the shipments index fell to -1.7. Delivery times lengthened slightly, and inventories increased. Employment levelled off, and the average workweek declined. Input price increases were little changed, while selling prices increased at a slower pace than last month. Optimism about the six-month outlook fell sharply, with firms less optimistic than they have been since 2009. The grey area on the chart indicates a recession.

"During a Monday interview on “Fox & Friends,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams discussed the approach to combating the coronavirus as it spreads across the country. Adams emphasized the importance of social distancing and properly washing hands, but said testing for the disease has now “reached a turning point,” which means more people are being tested at a local level. “[W]e’ve reached a turning point,” Adams said of coronavirus testing. “Important for people to know that the CDC stood up a test in less than one week for a new virus, so that was a record, but the CDC was never designed to provide hundreds of millions of tests. It was designed to respond to outbreaks. So, we went from CDC testing, which was slow by almost design, and then we actually stood up 83 different state labs, and you saw testing increase there. But the turning point was last Thursday when the FDA approved a new rapid throughput test, which will exponentially increase the amount of new tests that can be run. … You’re starting to see more testing at the local level.” He added, “Again, we’ve reached a turning point, and it’s because of the private industry.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Surgeon General on Coronavirus Testing: ‘We’ve Reached a Turning Point’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/surgeon-general-on-coronavirus-testing-weve-reached-a-turning-point/,Breitbart

Cotton told Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade the aim was to get government aid to people directly impacted by the virus. “I don’t think the House bill is going to pass the Senate as it’s written for one basic problem,” he said. “It doesn’t go far enough, and it doesn’t go fast enough. There are too many gaps in coverage for the smallest businesses and for medium-sized businesses. And I and a lot of other senators who I’ve spoken to over the weekend are worried that we’re not doing enough to get cash into the hands of affected workers and families quickly. So we’re going to be focused this week on how to do just that.” “If you’ve got the virus, if you’ve been quarantined because you’ve been exposed to the virus, if your business is shut down, or even if you have to stay home to care for a child whose school is closed, you should not worry about buying the groceries, making the car payments, paying your rent,” Cotton continued. “We’re going to do everything we can to get cash into the hands of affected workers and families as quickly as possible so we can all get through this epidemic — this pandemic together.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",Cotton: ‘We’re Going to Do Everything We Can to Get Cash into the Hands of Affected Workers’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/cotton-were-going-to-do-everything-we-can-to-get-cash-into-the-hands-of-affected-workers/,Breitbart
"On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) called for the nationalization of certain parts of the supply chain, and stated that “we’re getting close to a reality where the government has to ensure that the food supply, that it is not only available, but that it’s equitably distributed.” De Blasio said, “We’re going to need the supply chain nationalized in some form. Right now, there’s no effort to make sure that ventilators, surgical masks, even down to hand sanitizer, all these products should be put on a 24/7 production cycle. Whatever factories anywhere can make them should be cranking them out. They should be distributed according to federal priority, as you would in a war.” He later stated, “We’re providing meals all week at the schools, pick-up meals, breakfast and lunch. We’re going to have to create feeding stations of some kind going forward, of different types. We’re doing home deliveries for seniors. We’re closing down senior center programming, but we’re doing — using senior centers as kitchens in effect, dispensaries to get meals out to seniors at their home.

"The European Union refused to fund border fencing between Greece and Turkey prior to both the current border crisis and the 2015-16 border crisis, denouncing it as “pointless”. “We are against building walls,” declared the then-European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs, and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, in 2018 — a time when many European Union figures and EU member-state politicians, outside of pro-borders Central European countries such as Poland and Hungary, were at pains to signal their opposition to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. “The EU will never be a fortress. Migration will stay not only in Europe and the world for the decades to come,” insisted Avramopoulos — who, perhaps surprisingly, is himself a Greek politician from the right-leaning New Democracy party, then in opposition but now in office and attempting to hold the line against illegal immigration fairly vigorously. The eurocrat — as the EU’s unelected officials are colloquially known — was also a strong backer of the UN Global Compact for Migration, an EU resettlement programme importing tens of thousands of migrants direct from Africa, and the EU-Turkey deal which saw the bloc transfer billions of euros to Ankara in order to persuade it to stem the flow of illegal migrants across the Graeco-Turkish frontier. His assurances that the deal “delivers” and “is beneficial for the European Union and Turkey as well” have unravelled now that the Islamist president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has cancelled it unilaterally, announcing that the gates to Europe through his country are now open and actively transporting migrants to the border in large numbers.

The EU is not and will not co-finance this fence… It is pointless,” a spokesman for the then-European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, told the press in 2012.

"Sunday’s Democrat debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was only the second to mention coronavirus directly, though the issue had emerged weeks before it was first discussed by the candidates. President Donald Trump first mentioned coronavirus on Jan. 22, after it was brought up in a press conference. Vice President Mike Pence discussed it more extensively on Jan. 27. The president imposed a China travel ban Jan. 31. On Feb. 4, President Trump mentioned coronavirus in his State of the Union address, which was torn up by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Congress was still in the midst of the impeachment trial until Feb. 5. Democrats did not mention the coronavirus much at all, and it did not come up in the presidential primary debate in Iowa (Jan. 14). Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg referred to it indirectly in the New Hampshire debate (Feb. 7): “The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we’re seeing coming out of China.” It did not come up in Nevada (Feb. 19). It was first discussed somewhat extensively by the candidates in the South Carolina debate (Feb. 25), which is also when a moderator finally asked candidates about it. While watching tonight's Democratic debate, consider the number of times moderators asked any questions involving coronavirus at the past four Democratic debates: CBS News – February 26: 1 (83rd minute) NBC News – February 19: 0 ABC News – February 7: 0 CNN – January 14: 0 — Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) March 15, 2020  Coronavirus was first brought up by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who accused the president (inaccurately) of firing the pandemic specialists and cutting funding to the Centers for Disease Control. It was mentioned next by Buttigieg, in the context of national security. The moderator then asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) whether she would close the borders to “prevent an outbreak” in the United States. She did not answer the question directly, but said she would have coordinated her response better through the presidency than Trump had. Biden was asked about it and mentioned his experience during the fight against Ebola in 2014. Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer said the president’s “America First” foreign policy was inadequate for coronavirus. He reiterated his criticism of the president’s response to coronavirus in the spin room after the debate, saying that Trump was incompetent. If it could be said that the U.S. government could have done more, and earlier, to fight the coronavirus outbreak, it could also be said that the opposition and the media largely ignored the issue until more than a month after the Trump administration had begun to talk about it. Few anticipated how great a challenge coronavirus would be. Joel B.

"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon went into lockdown and Iraqis prepared for a curfew Monday as part of regional efforts to contain the new coronavirus even as businesses remained open in Iran, which is battling the worst outbreak in the Middle East and where another senior official has died from the virus. The divergent approaches adopted by local authorities reflect continued uncertainty over how to slow the spread of a virus that has infected around 170,000 people worldwide and caused more than 6,500 deaths. Most people experience only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and recover within weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by people with no visible symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Panic broke out in Iraq after authorities announced a weeklong curfew late on Sunday. People raced to supermarkets and swiftly emptied shelves, while others stocked up on kerosene and cooking gas. The curfew, which is set to begin late Tuesday, includes the suspension of all flights from Baghdad’s international airport. Iraq’s Health Ministry has reported 124 cases of coronavirus and nine deaths. In Lebanon, where the government ordered a lockdown starting Sunday night, traffic was thin and in some cases streets were completely empty on Monday, the start of the working week. Restaurants, cafes and bars have been closed since last week and most private businesses were also shuttered Monday. In some areas, police were going around and asking shop owners to close in line with the government orders. Few people could be seen at Lebanon’s seaside corniche, and police were asking them to leave. Pharmacies, bakeries and other businesses related to making or selling food were allowed to stay open. The small country has reported 99 cases and three deaths from the new coronavirus. Hamra Street, the Lebanese capital’s most famous shopping street and a residential district, was eerily quiet as shops, restaurants and cafes along the usually bustling thoroughfare were closed. Both Iraq and Lebanon have been largely in disarray since anti-government protests broke out last year, and Lebanon was mired in its worst financial crisis in years even before the pandemic began. One of the worst outbreaks in the world has unfolded in Iran, which has close ties to both Iraq and Lebanon. Authorities there have reported 14,000 confirmed cases and more than 700 deaths, with the toll rising by more than 100 in the last 24 hours. The real numbers may be even higher, as some have questioned the government’s reporting. Authorities have not ordered businesses to close, however, and many Iranians have dismissed fears about the virus and advice from public health officials to avoid social contact. Restaurants and cafes have remained open, though business has diminished. A member of the Assembly of Experts, which has the power to appoint or dismiss the country’s supreme leader, died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus, the semi-official Fars and Tasnim news agencies reported Monday. Ayatollah Hashem Bathaei, 78, is the latest of several senior Iranian officials to have died from the virus. Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials have caught the virus, compounding fears about Iran’s response to the global pandemic. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is 80 years old and has been in power since 1989, wore disposable gloves at a recent public event, apparently as a precaution. The official leading Iran’s response to the virus on Sunday expressed concerns that health facilities could be overwhelmed if the rate of new cases continues to climb. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency. Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed. Elsewhere in the region, the number of infections has continued to climb even as authorities have imposed strict travel and quarantine measures. Mideast stock markets also tumbled Monday, with the Dubai Financial Market closing down 6.14% and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange down 7.83%. Both have closed their trading floors over fears about the virus. Israel on Monday said its total number of infections had climbed to 250, more than double what it was just a few days ago. Authorities have closed all malls, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and day care centers, and have urged anyone who can work from home to do so. Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial announced Monday that its annual Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony would be held this year without an audience. The ceremony typically draws the country’s top leadership, foreign dignitaries and elderly Holocaust survivors. This year’s ceremony was scheduled to take place on April 20. Later on Monday, Israel will swear in its new Knesset, or parliament, after elections earlier this month. The 120 members will take the oath of office in groups of three, in keeping with bans on large gatherings. Pakistan reported a surge of 41 new cases in its Sindh province, which borders Iran. That brought its total number of infections to 94. Authorities there have closed schools and universities, and postponed an annual military parade planned for March 23. In Dubai, a major global business and travel hub, authorities announced all bars and pubs would be closed through the end of the month. Community pools across Dubai were locked on Monday, closed by developers for the same period. The Persian Gulf island nation of Bahrain, meanwhile, reported its first death from the virus. It has reported 221 confirmed cases.",Lebanon on Coronavirus Lockdown as Iraqis Prepare for Curfew,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/16/lebanon-on-coronavirus-lockdown-as-iraqis-prepare-for-curfew/,Breitbart
"Iran warned Monday the coronavirus pandemic could overwhelm local health facilities as the death toll topped 700 and another senior lawmaker died from the disease. Ayatollah Bathaee, representative of Tehran in the Assembly of Experts, died age 78 on Monday morning, according to the semi-official Tasnim newsagency. The cleric, who had been infected with coronavirus died at a hospital in Qom, the city where the first cases of coronavirus in Iran were detected.

Iran has closed schools and universities, suspended major cultural and sporting events and reduced working hours across the country to slow the contagion, which has spread to all of its 31 provinces. Such has been the devastation caused in Iran, local authorities are digging burial trenches so large they can be seen from space, as Breitbart News reported. The massive pits are being dug at the Behesht-e Masoumeh complex in Qom, about 80 miles south of Tehran. Within a month of its beginning, the two 100-yard trenches were visible by satellite. These trenches will supplement existing efforts to inter the rising death toll in Qom. According to official reports, more than 10,000 Iranians suffer from the coronavirus, although devout Iranian Muslims are releasing online videos showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they have no fear of infection and are willing to die for their faith.

That brings the country’s total death toll to 724, with nearly 14,000 confirmed cases, one of the worst outbreaks outside China. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency.",Another Iran Lawmaker Dies from Coronavirus as Death Toll Soars,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/16/another-iran-lawmaker-dies-from-coronavirus-as-death-toll-soars/,Breitbart
"The first sailor assigned to a U.S. warship has tested “presumptive positive” for the coronavirus, but authorities said Sunday the result needed to be confirmed by military health specialists. The diagnosis came a week after another U.S. Navy sailor stationed in southern Italy contracted the virus, which has killed more than 3,700 people worldwide including nearly 70 in the United States. “A Sailor assigned to the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer (LHD 4) tested ‘presumptive positive’ for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), marking the first case for a sailor aboard a Navy ship,” the Navy said in a statement. The sailor was in quarantine at home, it said, adding that “personnel that the individual immediately identified having close contact with have been notified and are in self-isolation at their residences.” USS Boxer (LHD-4) is alongside at Naval Station San Diego, Calif. and the sailor was first tested on Friday. Results came back on Saturday that indicated the sailor likely had the virus. The Navy said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would need to confirm the positive result as preparations continue to ensure the ongoing health of the fleet. <span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> Other Boxer crew that have come in contact with the presumed-to-be infected sailor have been notified are now in a 14-day quarantine in their quarters and in contact with Navy medical professionals, USNI News reports.

"Claim: Joe Biden claimed Sunday night the United States is a “nation of immigrants.” “Look, we are a nation of immigrants,” Biden said during his CNN debate against Bernie Sanders. He continued: Our future rests upon the Latino community being fully integrated. Twenty-four out of every 100 children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a Latino … We should be embracing, bringing them in, just like what happened with the Irish immigrants after the famine, just what happened with the Italians, et cetera. We have been through this before. Xenophobia is a disease. Verdict: False. Roughly 86 percent of people in the United States are native-born citizens and their native-born children. That 86 percent share means that six out of seven residents in the United States are native-born Americans. Only one in seven people in the United States are either legal immigrants or illegal migrants. The United States’ population is roughly 329.4 million. “Drawing on the most authoritative, current data available about the 44.7 million immigrants residing in the United States as of 2018,” said a February 2020 report by the pro-migration Migration Policy Institute. “Today, more than 40 million people living in the U.S. were born in another country,” said a June 2019 report by the Pew Research Center. In 2017, the U.S. population included 278.8 million native-born citizens, 20.7 million “naturalized citizens,” 13.1 million resident aliens or “legal noncitizens,” and 11.3 million “unauthorized immigrants,” according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The United States is a “Nation of Immigrants” claim was promoted in the late 1950s by then-Sen. John Kennedy. In October 2018, Breitbart reported Rep. Joe Kenndy’s description of the claim: Few felt it as deeply as President John F. Kennedy. In his 1964 book A Nation of Immigrants, recently re-released, my great-uncle outlines the compelling case for immigration, in economic, moral, and global terms. “The abundant resources of this land provided the foundation for a great nation,” he writes. “But only people could make the opportunity a reality. Immigration provided the human resources.” A February 2018 report in the New York Times said that claim is only a “phrase”: “Immigrant advocates today invoke the phrase to remind the country that most Americans have an ancestor who was once a newcomer to the United States.” The article said: Published posthumously, Kennedy’s “A Nation of Immigrants” highlighted the contribution of immigrants when the country was engulfed in a debate over the direction of its immigration policy. The phrase appears at least as far back as 1874, in an editorial published in The Daily State Journal of Alexandria, which praised a bill passed by the Virginia Senate appropriating $15,000 to encourage European immigration. “We are a nation of immigrants and immigrants’ children,” it said. But the “Nation of Immigrants” claim is commonplace, even though it implies that immigrants’ are more American than their native-born descendants. “I’m proud to be among the first to greet you as ‘My fellow Americans’… We can never say it often or loudly enough: Immigrants and refugees revitalize and renew America,” former President Barack Obama claimed at December 2015 naturalization ceremony, while standing under a giant mural of the nation’s Founding Fathers. “We will make America more American by passing – protecting our patriotic, courageous Dreamers!” said Rep. Nancy Pelosi said as she regained the speakership of the House in January 2019. A progressive columnist at the New York Times declared in June 2017: So-called real Americans are screwing up America. Maybe they should leave, so that we can replace them with new and better ones: newcomers who are more appreciative of what the United States has to offer, more ambitious for themselves and their children, and more willing to sacrifice for the future. In other words, just the kind of people we used to be — when “we” had just come off the boat… I’m the child of immigrants and grew up abroad, I have always thought of the United States as a country that belongs first to its newcomers — the people who strain hardest to become a part of it because they realize that it’s precious; and who do the most to remake it so that our ideas, and our appeal, may stay fresh. “The U.S. is back to being a nation of immigrants,” said an August 2018 report at Axios.com: The share of the U.S. population made up by immigrants has returned to the levels at the turn of the 20th century — although the makeup of today’s immigrant population looks very different. Why it matters: As we saw a century ago, and are witnessing again now, immigration brings needed labor and economic benefits, but is often met with backlash from those who fear the America they know is slipping away.    ",Fact Check: Joe Biden Claimed the U.S. Is a ‘Nation of Immigrants’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/fact-check-joe-biden-says-the-u-s-is-a-nation-of-immigrants/,Breitbart
"The European Union has said that the Greek government must allow migrants to apply for asylum, despite its rhetorical support for their efforts to prevent the Turkish government from facilitating a wave of illegal migration into Greece. Ylva Johansson, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, insisted: “Individuals in the European Union have the right to apply for asylum. This is in the treaty, this is in international law. This we can’t suspend.” After Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s Islamist president, announced the migrants would be free to pass through his country into Europe, Greece suspended migrants’ automatic right to claim and asylum, to allow border forces to turn illegal migrants back and prevent a 2015-style deluge. The EU does not typically allow its member-states to take such decisions on their own, but Greek prime minister Kyriákos Mitsotákis claimed he had invoked a little-known emergency clause in the EU treaties to permit the move — a claim which has been disputed by anti-borders actors and now the EU itself. “We are going to discuss actually what they are doing, but they have to let people apply for asylum,” said Commissioner Johansson — a Swede from the Scandinavian country’s Social Democrat party — in comments reported by the Guardian. WATCH: EU-funded Turkish Armoured Vehicle Rips Down Greek Border Fence https://t.co/4sL0uEHlsY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 10, 2020  The left-wing newspaper suggested that the emergency clause Prime Minister Mitsotákis invoked cannot be used unless the European Union proposes it and all member-states agree — and Commissioner Johansson was clear that the bloc had no plans to suspend the right to claim asylum. Indeed, the Swede favours “a mandatory solidarity mechanism” to tackle the Greek border crisis — i.e. a revival of the compulsory migrant redistribution quotas the EU tried to impose on its member-states following the 2015-16 influx. These quotas, while partially implemented, foundered in the face of pro-borders, right-leaning governments in Poland, Hungary, and the rest of Central Europe. These countries resented efforts to force them to absorb a share of the migration influx which, unlike the German and other Western European governments which voted for the quotas in the European Council, they had always opposed. “We believe that a high number of Muslims necessarily leads to parallel societies,” said Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán in 2018. “Multiculturalism is just an illusion. We do not want that. And we will not have anything forced on us.” While the Hungarian leader’s stance is now depicted as extreme by large sections of the media, it in fact closely resembles the position of Germany’s Angela Merkel in 2010, when she said that multiculturalism had “failed, utterly failed”.

Approximately 10,000 pilgrims returned from Saudi Arabia on Saturday night, youth and sports minister Mehmet Kasapoglu was quoted as saying by the official Anadolu news agency. Koca said the number of confirmed cases in Turkey reached six after one of the pilgrims who returned from visiting the holy sites in Saudi Arabia over the last one week tested positive. “Those found suspicious are hospitalised as soon as they return and tested,” he said. Turkey’s religious affairs authority, Diyanet, said the travels for pilgrimage have been halted from February 27. As part of its bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, Turkey has applied travel restrictions on a total of 15 countries including France, Italy and Germany.

"Sunday on MSNBC’s “Kasie DC,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) slammed President Donald Trump and his administration for putting the United States “weeks and weeks behind” on combating the coronavirus threat. According to Ryan, the United States was so far behind in testing because Trump thought the coronavirus was a “hoax” and was in “denial” about the legitimacy of the uproar. “I think the University of Cincinnati is starting to produce their own tests because the federal government — it was a [woeful] attempt to try to get where we want to be as far as testing,” the Ohio Democrat outlined. “We are, you know, weeks and weeks behind because the president said it was a hoax and we were in denial, so, of course, we’re going to be behind on these things. So, we are lucky to have them. They’re not at a level we want, and we don’t have enough tests that we need here in Ohio. … We think there may be over 100,000 people who would test positive, but we don’t have the tests.” Ryan stressed, “[H]aving the tests available at the level we need to be able to stop this is really, really important.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Ryan: U.S. ‘Weeks Behind’ on Coronavirus Because Trump Thought It Was a Hoax,2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/15/ryan-u-s-weeks-behind-on-coronavirus-because-trump-thought-it-was-a-hoax/,Breitbart
"Democrat frontrunner Joe Biden said Sunday he will restart the catch and release of southern migrants into Americans’ workplaces, neighborhoods, and K-12 schools. “No one, no one would be put in jail while waiting for their [asylum] hearing,” Biden told the audience during CNN’s Democrat debate. President Donald Trump has largely blocked the huge 2019 inflow of Latin American migrants into blue-collar jobs by ending catch and release policies, which allow migrants to get the U.S jobs they need to pay off their smuggling debts to the cartel-affiliates coyotes. By ending catch and release, Trump created an economic deterrent to further migration, causing an immediate crash in migrant numbers. In May 2019, for example, 140,000 migrants paid thousands of dollars to be smuggled across the U.S. border. In January, only 30,000 people migrated to the border because many would-be migrants understood they would not be released to get a U.S. job. The shutdown of catch and release also pressured U.S. employers to raise Americans’ wages — and to keep jobs open for sidelined Americans. In 2019, wages for blue-collar Americans rose roughly five percent, while wages for white-collar Americans rose by less than four percent. Released migrants can also hide from enforcement authorities and use their U.S. paychecks to hire coyotes for their spouses. The jobs can also fund the coyotes who bring their children up to the border’s “Unaccompanied Alien Children” loophole and then into the K-12 schools needed by Americans’. In May 2019, roughly 80,000 migrants were allowed into the United States because the rush of 140,000 migrants overwhelmed the border defenses. In February 2002, 95 percent of migrants were denied release and were instead redirected home or to wait in Mexico until an asylum court can hear their plea, border officials told Breitbart News. However, the officials also said they released 2,000 people into the United States. They were released for reasons of health and to serve as witnesses in court cases, officials said.",Joe Biden Promises to Restart ‘Catch and Release’ of Migrants,2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/15/joe-biden-promises-to-restart-catch-and-release-of-migrants/,Breitbart
"Governors and mayors across the nation are issuing orders limiting the size of public gatherings and closing non-essential entertainment venues to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. California, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington state, and New York City are among the places that ordered bars to close and restaurants to stop dine-in service. Takeout and delivery will still be allowed. In New Orleans and Chicago, people clad in green for St. Patrick’s Day packed bars and spilled onto crowded sidewalks Saturday, even after the cities canceled their parades. “I’m not about to put my life on hold because this is going around,” Kyle Thomas told the Chicago Sun-Times. Thomas, a nurse from Colorado, said he had flown to Chicago to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with friends and thought people might be ”overreacting.” In New Orleans, Syd Knight, 86, celebrated despite the public health warnings and the higher risk she faced because of her age. “The Lord will take care of us all,” Knight told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate. Oklahoma’s governor tweeted a picture of himself and his children at a crowded metro restaurant Saturday night. In the since-deleted tweet, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt wrote: “Eating with my kids and all my fellow Oklahomans at the @CollectiveOKC. It’s packed tonight!” “The governor will continue to take his family out to dinner and to the grocery store without living in fear, and encourages Oklahomans to do the same,” Charlie Hannema, a spokesman for the governor, said in an email. Health officials have advised people to distance themselves from each other socially. Some states have banned gatherings with more than a certain number of people. Those warnings have become more urgent as the disease spread in the U.S., where about 3,500 people have become infected and more than 60 have died. The vast majority of people who contract the new virus recover within weeks. It causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but can lead to more severe illness, including pneumonia for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems. “The time for persuasion and public appeals is over,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. “This is not a joke. No one is immune to this.” The Democratic governor ordered all bars and restaurants in his state to close from Monday night until March 30. He said he had tried earlier last week to appeal to everyone’s good judgment to stay home, to avoid bars, and not congregate in crowds. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a statement saying he will limit the city’s 27,000 restaurants, bars and cafes to food takeout and delivery beginning Tuesday. Nightclubs, movie theaters, small theater houses, and concert venues will have to close. Washington, the state hardest hit by the virus with more than 40 dead, will see its bars, restaurants, entertainment and recreation facilities all temporarily closed except for food takeout and delivery. “These are very difficult decisions, but hours count here and very strong measures are necessary to slow the spread of the disease,” Inslee said. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker also ordered all bars and dine-in restaurants to close for three weeks. The Republican asked residents “to take a deep breath and understand the rationale behind this guidance.” All bars and restaurants in Ohio are closed until further notice. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said the “very drastic action” was prompted by concerns from around the state about crowded bars. “If we don’t take these actions now, it’ll be too late,” he said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs to close in the nation’s most populous state. The Democrat said the new orders are guidelines that “we have the capacity to enforce if necessary.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive order Sunday evening closing all “bars, nightclubs, restaurants (except takeout/delivery), entertainment venues, and other establishments in the city of Los Angeles” until March 31. Officials in New Jersey are considering a statewide curfew to help prevent the spread of the virus, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday. “A friend of mine walked into a bar/restaurant last night in Asbury Park and they were packed,” Murphy, a Democrat, said on WBLS-FM 107.5. “And people are on top of each other. And that’s probably, sadly, at least for the near term, scenarios that we’re not going to be able to abide by much longer because, inevitably, somebody is going to infect somebody else in a situation like that.” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said it was “unacceptable” that people were ignoring a ban issued by Gov. John Bel Edwards on gatherings of more than 250 people. The violators were “actively increasing the danger to their neighbors and their loved ones,” Cantrell said. The hashtag “StayTheFHome” was trending on Twitter on Sunday. Several countries in Europe have closed bars. Advising people to completely avoid restaurants “might be overkill right now,” the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” but he added that he wouldn’t go to one himself because he didn’t want to be in a “crowded place” and risk having to self-quarantine. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a recommendation Sunday night that all in-person events involving 50 people or more be called off for the next eight weeks. “CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next 8 weeks, organizers … cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States,” the recommendation stated. “Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing.” The Associated Press contributed to this article.","California, Washington, Ohio, Massachusetts, Illinois Close Bars and Restaurants over Coronavirus",2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/15/california-washington-ohio-massachusetts-illinois-close-bars-and-restaurants-over-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Sunday on his Fox News Channel show “The Revolution,” Steve Hilton addressed the coronavirus pandemic and what Americans are being told by public health officials on television. Hilton said people have heard from public health officials and question why they have heard there was little risk for young and healthy people dying from the coronavirus but yet schools and other large gatherings are being shut down. “There’s a curious divergence between the real world and the people on TV and Twitter,” Hilton began. “On TV, you see facts and responsible reporting and important helpful advice, to be sure, but also, too often unhelpful overdramatizing.” Hilton went on to point out there is a big question still not answered by the health officials — why are the people who are most likely to die from contracting the coronavirus not the ones being isolated from the public? “I have a plea to Dr. Fauci and the others. You want all Americans to cooperate with your public health strategy. At the organizational level with the NBA and so on, that is happening,” Hilton stated. “But there are still millions of Americans who quite frankly don’t buy into what you’re saying, and simply repeating it won’t work.” He continued, “You need to answer the big question many Americans are asking, and it is this: Instead of closing schools, colleges, sports and other large gatherings for the general population, why don’t we isolate the vulnerable population like California just announced? instead of draconian steps that will tank the economy for everyone, why don’t we focus our draconian action on those most at risk? Now, I’m sure there’s a good answer to that question, but we haven’t heard it yet from Dr. Fauci or any of them.

"LOS ANGELES, California — Local grocery store shelves sat bare at the end of a weekend of aggressive buying by consumers stocking up for long stays at home during the coronavirus outbreak. Sources in the food industry told Breitbart News that the supply chain should respond well, though there may be a few bottlenecks, and delays in individual products. One California produce farmer told Breitbart News that customers have been “buying like crazy,” and that he had sold “two months’ supply in one week.” He said he expected farms to keep producing. Local reservoirs are well-supplied, especially after several days of rain — a good sign in a state where dry years mean entire farms can go offline. It is also possible that grocery shelves will stay full once the initial wave of buying has passed. One industry executive was also optimistic, but did not want to be quoted: he was in self-imposed quarantine. That illustrates a potential problem in the food industry, as in others: how to keep the workforce on the job — when local authorities are banning gatherings, school closings are forcing parents to stay home, and incidental contact with possible coronavirus victims could take employees out of commission. Restaurants still have enough food; their problem is a lack of customers after a sudden, sharp drop in demand. “A lot of us are sitting on [food] inventory right now,” one restaurant owner told Breitbart News. However, he said, there was speculation that distributors might not purchase new food stocks, given the downturn in the industry, and a possible credit crunch. Amidst the crisis, there may be new opportunities — for delivery services. On Sunday night, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that restaurants would only be allowed to supply food through takeout and delivery, starting Tuesday. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti took similar action. That new circumstance is expanding market for companies like Postmates and DoorDash. Once seen as a convenience, or a nuisance, now delivery companies may become a necessity. As long as there are enough drivers, and they remain healthy, and food preparation facilities can steer clear of coronavirus, the answer to any lingering grocery store woes may be outsourcing family meals.

"During Sunday night’s eleventh debate between Democrat primary candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders repeatedly defended China’s “progress on poverty.” He did not note the astronomical death toll that preceded its alleged success. Sanders cornered himself into defending the Chinese Communist Party in a series of answers to questions about his repeated support for communist Cuba, which he claimed in the past deserved praise for increasing literacy rates in the region’s formerly wealthiest country at gunpoint. Univisión’s Ilia Calderón, one of the moderators for the debate also hosted by CNN, asked Sanders to answer how he could expect Cuban-Americans in Florida to vote for him after he repeatedly approved of the murderous Castro regime. “I have opposed authoritarianism, whether it’s in Cuba, whether it’s in Saudi Arabia, whether it’s in China, or whether it is in Russia. That is my life record,” Sanders replied, a false claim he has made repeatedly when confronted with his near-routine support of violent communist tyrannies. As Sanders did not address Calderón’s question regarding Florida voters in any way, she repeated it, more broadly asking if it would be wiser not to compliment dictatorships like Cuba’s. Sanders responded by turning the question into one about China. “I think you could make the same point about China. China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society, ok? But would anybody deny — would any economist deny — that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago?” Sanders asked. “That’s a fact. So I think we condemn authoritarianism whether it’s in China, Russia, Cuba, anyplace else. But to simply say nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would, I think, be incorrect.” Biden then stepped into the discussion, offering helplessly: “China is an authoritarian dictatorship; that’s what it is. We have to deal with them because they’re there.” To his credit, Biden noted that China is currently imprisoning, torturing, and enslaving at least one million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in concentration camps. Sanders disputes that the brutal human rights situation in China negates its alleged “progress on poverty” and that it is “absurd” to deny the “positive” the Chinese Communist Party has contributed to its people. Much of Sunday’s debate focused on America’s response to the global pandemic caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, an outbreak the Chinese Communist Party hid from the world for months, making it nearly impossible to stop on multiple continents. The Chinese Communist Party, since founding the People’s Republic of China in the mid-20th century, has claimed to spearhead prodigious poverty alleviation programs. The original such program under dictator Mao Zedong was known as the Great Leap Forward, a plan to turn all of China from an agrarian society to an industrial one. While Mao is personally believed responsible for the deaths of 70 million people, the Great Leap Forward itself is only believed to be responsible for 45 million deaths. To turn China into an “industrial,” prosperous nation, Mao banned private farming and forced communities to all participate in farming, demanding impossibly agricultural yields that never occurred. Mao also forced communities to sacrifice any metal belongings, melting them to use in attempts at manufacturing. While Mao murdered many for opposing his authoritarianism or simply for suspecting their disagreement, the vast majority of the deaths under his poverty alleviation program were the result of famine. Citing author Yang Jisheng, The Guardian‘s Tania Branigan described life during the Great Leap Forward: A decade after the Communist party took power in 1949, promising to serve the people, the greatest manmade disaster in history stalks an already impoverished land. In an unremarkable city in central Henan province, more than a million people – one in eight – are wiped out by starvation and brutality over three short years. In one area, officials commandeer more grain than the farmers have actually grown. In barely nine months, more than 12,000 people – a third of the inhabitants – die in a single commune; a tenth of its households are wiped out. Thirteen children beg officials for food and are dragged deep into the mountains, where they die from exposure and starvation. A teenage orphan kills and eats her four-year-old brother. Forty-four of a village’s 45 inhabitants die; the last remaining resident, a woman in her 60s, goes insane. Others are tortured, beaten or buried alive for declaring realistic harvests, refusing to hand over what little food they have, stealing scraps or simply angering officials. Sanders did not specify which of China’s many poverty alleviation programs he was praising, though he said he was comparing current poverty levels with those of 40 or 50 years ago, placing his point of comparison about a decade after the Great Leap Forward and in the Cultural Revolution, which historians estimate killed up to eight million people.

Suddenly, today, Joe Biden is a free-spending socialist.” He added that while Biden is “basically, after all is said and done, maintaining the status quo in health care. … I think we are winning the ideological struggle, and we won it tonight.” Sanders further stated, “I think you have heard media and others talking about, isn’t it remarkable, how when we had 18 candidates to begin this process, so many of them have moved so far of where we were four years ago. You just heard this tonight. Yesterday, Biden, basically, is saying, yeah, I voted for that bankruptcy bill, bad idea, I’m going to adopt Elizabeth Warren’s position, that’s a good bill, okay? Today, he says, oh, I think we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, up to a certain level. Yes, we have brought Biden — well, we’ll see how real it is.

"Claim: Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed on Sunday during CNN’s Democrat presidential debate that the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, was due to climate change. Verdict: False. “What’s Darfur all about? Darfur was all about the fact that the sub-Sarahan desert, because of the change in the climate, no longer had enough arable land,” Biden said during a conversation about the alleged effects of climate change. However, despite Biden’s claim, many analysts have blamed racial conflict and land rights, not climate change. The United Nations (U.N.) estimated that 300,000 had died because of the conflict. The International Criminal Court (ICC) had indicted Sudan President Omar al-Bashir for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. James Copnall, a Sudan analyst, wrote in 2013 that the Darfur conflict originated over “hakurat,” or land rights. Copnall also wrote that the conflict arose between Arab militias and African groups such as the Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit. The Atlantic helped popularize the idea that the “real roots” of the Darfur conflict was “global warming” in a 2007 article. The Atlantic noted that much of Darfur’s lands were “failing,” which was explained through “imprudent land use.” Atlantic writer Stephan Faris wrote: Why did Darfur’s lands fail? For much of the 1980s and ’90s, environmental degradation in Darfur and other parts of the Sahel (the semi-arid region just south of the Sahara) was blamed on the inhabitants. Dramatic declines in rainfall were attributed to mistreatment of the region’s vegetation. Imprudent land use, it was argued, exposed more rock and sand, which absorb less sunlight than plants, instead reflecting it back toward space. This cooled the air near the surface, drawing clouds downward and reducing the chance of rain. “Africans were said to be doing it to themselves,” says Isaac Held, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Faris wrote that climate scientists devised an alternative theory: climate change had changed Darfur’s environment. “This was not caused by people cutting trees or overgrazing,” Alessandra Giannini, a Columbia University climate professor, said. However, even as the Faris noted, it remains an “open question” on the extent to which human activity can be blamed for a country’s changing environment.

The president’s exit from Sunday’s press conference prompted Chris Evans to lash out on social media. “The president just ran off stage after his rambling press conference without answering a single question,” the Knives Out tweeted. “America wants answers.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden cost taxpayers nearly $200,000 as he toured the globe during his father’s time in office. According to USASpending.gov, a database that collects and reports unclassified government expenditures, Biden’s trips cost taxpayers $193,696 for Secret Service protection. The Washington Free Beacon, which was first to report on the matter, noted; That amount is nearly four times the recorded security bill of the four adult Trump children—combined. Biden visited more than 10 countries during his father’s term, including China, Qatar, and South Africa, according to the database. Throughout his travels, Biden received multiple bills, which involved taxpayer payments to a “miscellaneous foreign contractor” or a “miscellaneous foreign awardee.” Most obvious throughout the records in the database was Biden’s cost of Secret Service protection. The totals for Biden, who has never held a government position, far surpassed that of the Trump family, which are recorded by the database to have spent about $40,000. Biden has faced scrutiny from several within Congress for his excessive travel. Earlier this year, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) requested Hunter Biden’s travel records from the Secret Service in an effort to identify “potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates.” While the database did not contain records on his time in Ukraine, it did contain information on his trips to China in 2013 and 2014, as noted by the Washington Free Beacon: The database has not disclosed details about the Secret Service protection for Hunter Biden’s time in Ukraine. It does, however, show that Hunter visited China on at least two other occasions, once each before and after the December 2013 meeting. The records show that Hunter Biden stayed in China for one to two weeks in June 2013 and March 2014, costing taxpayers nearly $13,000. Last week, Hunter Biden reached a final settlement in a paternity and child support case in Arkansas after repeatedly delaying the case and flouting court orders to release financial information.

But, I’m going to be announcing more actions today. We closed the schools yesterday, making sure there’s childcare for healthcare workers, because again, this all comes down to hospital capacity. Some of these states have closed schools and made no capacity for childcare and now you see healthcare workers and nurses not showing up. Closing schools, closing bars, closing restaurants, closing mass gatherings, we’ll be doing more of that.

"The Supreme Court announced Monday that it is suspending oral arguments scheduled for March and early April due to health concerns stemming from the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. “In keeping with public health precautions recommended in response to COVID-19, the Supreme Court is postponing the oral arguments currently scheduled for the March session,” the court said in a statement. “The court’s March session includes April 1. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” the statement added. One of the postponed arguments involves a case regarding whether House Democrats can obtain President Donald Trump’s financial records. Six of the nine justices are 65 and older, at higher risk of getting very sick from the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, and Stephen Breyer, 81, are the oldest members of the court. There is no new date set for the postponed arguments. the building has been closed to the public since last week. The only other time the 85-year-old court building was closed for arguments was in October 2001, when anthrax was detected in the court mailroom. That led the justices to hold arguments in the federal courthouse about a half mile from the Supreme Court, Within a week and after a thorough cleaning, the court reopened. In 1918, when the court still met inside the Capitol, arguments were postponed for a month because of the flu pandemic. In the nation’s early years, in August 1793 and August 1798, adjustments were made because of yellow fever outbreaks, the court said.

"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Monday endorsed a policy prescription in which the U.S. government would give $1,000 monthly to every American adult as part of an effort to help ease financial strain during the coronavirus outbreak. “Every American adult should immediately receive $1,000 to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy,” Romney said in a statement. The Utah Republican also called on the Senate to pass a House bipartisan coronavirus relief package that was approved early Saturday morning following negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). “The House coronavirus response package contains critical measures to help families in Utah and across the nation in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, and the Senate should act swiftly on this legislation,” he stated. Romney’s backing of the measure comes after Harvard Professor Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under President Barack Obama, proposed the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Congress should pass a “one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria,” wrote Furman. The law “should also specify that the payments would continue in 2021 and beyond if the unemployment rate rises to 5.5% and remains there or higher. Hopefully this will not happen, but if it does, the money will be needed,” he added. Furman’s proposal echoes that of Breitbart News Economics editor John Carney, who wrote Saturday that the government “need[s] to put cash into the hands of the American people as quickly as possible.” “I propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending,” Carney argued. “It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects.” The idea draws on universal basic income, championed by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which the government would give all citizens a guaranteed annual income from the government. In a Monday tweet, Yang urged Congress to adopt a form of UBI to help combat the pandemic: “What exactly is the political downside of putting money into people’s hands?

Tom Cotton (R-AR), have said that the House’s relief package is doomed to fail in the upper chamber because it doesn’t go far enough. “For one basic problem, it doesn’t go far enough, it doesn’t go fast enough,” Cotton told Fox & Friends, noting that small and medium-sized businesses aren’t sufficiently covered by the bill. “I and a lot of the other senators, who I’ve spoken to over the weekend, are worried that we’re not doing enough to get cash in the hands of affected workers and families quickly so we’re going to be focused this week on how to do just that,” the Arkansas Republican continued. “We worry that the bill setting up a new and complicated system relying on businesses giving paid sick leave and then getting a refundable tax credit won’t move quickly enough and could put pressure on those businesses to lay workers off.” “We don’t want to see layoffs, we want to see people who are at home, if they have any reason to be home, supported immediately. This is an emergency measure that only needs to last a few weeks if we all take the prudent steps necessary,” he added.","Mitt Romney Endorses Giving $1,000 to Every American Adult During Coronavirus Outbreak",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/mitt-romney-endorses-giving-1000-to-every-american-adult-during-coronavirus-outbreak/,Breitbart

Clyburn told Axios that he “seriously” feels the United States under Trump’s leadership could go the same direction as Nazi Germany given how Republicans, much like Nazis knew Adolf Hitler was lying but did not check him on anything, are letting the president get away with lying. “We see an open fight with the media,” he said. “Everything is fake news unless it is favorable towards this president. We have heard open discussions about him, referring to himself as the ‘Law Enforcer in Chief.’ We don’t have that kind of stuff in this country.

Co-hosts Joe Scarborough said, “We can talk about what’s going on inside the White House. You know a lot of the players in there right now. Let’s talk about what’s happening on Wall Street. Obviously, the president got what he finally wanted from the fed which is reducing the interest rates about as low as you can reduce them. And yet we still have a run. Australia last night, lost about 10% of their market value. Asia also routed. Europe routed. And it looks like that’s going to be happening to the United States markets, as well. Wall Street set up for a very grim open. Why do you think the fed cut, the dramatic fed action yesterday, is having no impact on the markets this morning?” Scaramucci said, “I think, Joe, good morning, but I actually think the fed has had a major impact on the markets. This would be way worse if they didn’t make that dramatic Sunday night cut, and why is that? Because you literally have set a pause button on the global economy for three to six months. And as you know, many people in the United States and globally are living paycheck to paycheck, or if you’re in a small business, you’re living revenue day to revenue day, and a result of which, when you step back and analyze the economy. Forget about the market for a second. There are many businesses and many families that won’t be able to sustain that.” He continued, “The next thing that the market knows and people are starting to figure this out now is that Donald Trump is the virus. At the end of the day, what he’s done is affected and replicated through the executive branch, and he’s destroyed the crisis management elements of the executive branch that we need right now. Not only here in the United States, but globally. So the real tragedy of all of this— if the Federal Reserve can only do so much to help the markets. You’re going to need fiscal stimulus here and literally handing out free money to people to help them afford their rent, help them pay their waiters and waitresses in their closed restaurants. And again, it’s a national tragedy born from one person. You have remember to, the president’s staff is afraid of him. And so they don’t like dealing with them and they’re trying to make something that’s very insane, which is President Trump, sound sane. And so this is the danger that we’re dealing with right now. But the market does know, Joe, that Donald Trump is actually the virus and he’s replicated throughout the executive branch and has more or less decapitated their ability to handle this crisis.” He added, “The first thing is to have a group intervention with the president and explain to him what he is doing in terms of telling people we’ve got it under control, and this litany of 18,000 or 20,000 lies at this point. They’ve got to isolate him. He almost needs to go into a verbal communication quarantine to help out the rest of the nation. The second step you have to do is listen to Dr. Fauci. We likely need a 14 to a 21-day quarantine of all nonessential services in the United States. If you listen to any of the people that really understand this problem, directionally, we’ll probably save the excess capacity issues we’re going to have in the hospital. So, to me, step one, quarantine the president. Get him off of Twitter. Get him away from a television camera, and then, step two, bring people in like Dr. Fauci to explain what’s going on and take immediate and aggressive action here. You have to overcompensate for the mistakes that have been made, but we need to do it immediately.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","Scaramucci: ‘Trump Is the Virus’ — He Needs to Be ‘Quarantined’ from Twitter, Television",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/scaramucci-trump-is-the-virus-he-needs-to-be-quarantined-from-twitter-television/,Breitbart
"A Today show staffer has contracted the Chinese coronavirus, leading co-hosts Craig Melvin and Al Roker to temporarily go off-air, co-anchor Savannah Guthrie announced on Monday. “Personal note, for this show: Last night we learned that a colleague of ours on the third hour of ‘Today’ has tested positive for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus,” Guthrie announced: We learned late last night a colleague on the 3rd hour of TODAY tested positive for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution, Craig and Al are taking the morning off while we map that colleague’s close contacts. pic.twitter.com/aVHJpMU1Fj — TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 16, 2020  Because of that and out of an “abundance of caution,” co-hosts Melvin and Roker took the morning off so that the network can “trace their contacts, see what’s going on with them,” Guthrie continued, adding that they both “feel good.” “We promise to keep you posted. Both are fine right now. They feel good. But caution is the order of the day,” she said. NBC News president Noah Oppenheim also released a statement to staffers. We have learned that a TODAY employee based at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and working for the 9am hour has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19). We are fully supporting our colleague, who is experiencing mild symptoms and receiving medical care, and I know you join me in sending our very best for a quick recovery. As you know, we have been preparing for this possibility and are taking all necessary steps to ensure the health and safety of our teams, which includes multiple deep cleanings of our offices, control room and Studio 1A. Additionally, we are identifying employees who had been in close proximity to the affected employee and — while not required to do so by the NY Health Department — are in the process of asking those who had close contact to self-isolate. The news comes as networks make key changes as the concerns over the coronavirus loom large. CBS News shut its doors in New York for a deep clean last week after two staffers contracted the virus: Employees will be asked to work remotely for the next two days and broadcasts moved to accommodate the cleaning, the network said. For instance, “CBS This Morning” will originate out of Washington on Thursday and Friday while the New York offices are cleaned. People who came in contact with the sick employees will be asked to self-quarantine for the next two weeks, CBS News President Susan Zirinsky said in a memo to staff. “At this point, we anticipate the offices will be open Monday,” Zirinsky wrote. … Meanwhile, The Associated Press and NBC News on Wednesday announced work-at-home plans as concerns about the global pandemic grew. CNN, along with the Democratic National Committee (DNC), also made key changes for the Democrat debate on Sunday, holding it in-studio in the nation’s capital rather than in Arizona, as previously planned.

"The ACLU is asking a judge to release migrants from a Seattle detention center because China’s Wuhan epidemic is spreading through the state. “Public health experts say releasing immigrant detainees who are at heightened risk for COVID-19 due to age or medical condition is “a critically important way to meaningfully mitigate that risk,” said a tweet from the ACLU, which opposes most border enforcement. The Wuhan virus spreads rapidly among people who live in close contact with each other. It can impose crippling sickness on some young and healthy people, but it is deadly to many sick or old people. Almost 40,000 people are being held in roughly 20 immigration detention centers — partly because the ACLU has sought to kill the laws and barriers which deter migrants from illegally sneaking into U.S. workplaces and residential areas. The Department of Homeland Security considers Wuhan to be a major risk and has reportedly shut down family visits to minimize the chance of a disease outbreak in a detention center. One fix to the dilemma would be a rapid return of the illegal migrants to their home countries, according to Jessica Vaughan, the policy director at the Center for Immigration studies. “Wouldn’t they be more at risk on the outside?” she responded via Twitter. “Maybe repatriation to [their] home country would be safest.” A Buzzfeed report spotlighted the foreign detainees who are most vulnerable to China’s epidemic:: The filing in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington identified nine immigrants in custody at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, including a 48-year-old Jamaican woman with cholangitis, a progressive liver disease, who has been told she has only 10 to 12 years to live. The advocates said the woman was “critically vulnerable to COVID-19 because of her autoimmune disease and diabetes.” … “ICE has the responsibility to protect the safety of all who are in immigration detention. As a first step, it should immediately release our clients who have already been identified by the federal government as being most at risk because of this epidemic,” said Matt Adams, legal director for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which joined the ACLU in the lawsuit. “If it waits to react to worst-case scenarios once they take hold, it will already be too late.” The virus is already forcing border agencies to screen deportees before they are sent back to cooperating countries, including Guatemala and El Salvador. Deportees with high temperatures are kept off the returns flights out of concern that the deportees might carry the disease from U.S. detention centers into the vulnerable countries and possibly wreck the countries’ cooperation. The Department of Homeland Security responded to Buzzfeed.com: “Detainees who meet CDC criteria for epidemiologic risk of exposure to COVID-19 are housed separately from the general population. ICE places detainees with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a single medical housing room, or in a medical airborne infection isolation room specifically designed to contain biological agents, such as COVID-19,” ICE said in a statement describing its process for isolating detainees who potentially have the disease. “This prevents the spread of the agent to other individuals and the general public. ICE transports individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, or those who require higher levels of care or monitoring, to appropriate hospitals with expertise in high risk care.” Pro-migration Democrats are also urging the release of many migrants into the United States. “We urge you to prioritize the health and safety of those in your custody and employment by reducing detention numbers in a safe and swift manner, including by expeditiously placing children in homes and releasing non-priority detainees,” said the March 13 letter signed by the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Joaquin Castro, (D-Texas). On March 15, Buzzfeed also spotlighted an effort by progressives to shutter the packed immigration courts for several weeks: The union representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement prosecutors joined immigration judges and lawyers in calling for the immediate shutdown of courts across the country to curb the spread of the coronavirus, an unprecedented alliance that signals the deep anxiety that has spread through all facets of the US immigration system. “These are not normal times,” Fanny Behar Ostrow, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 511, which represents ICE prosecutors, told BuzzFeed News. “This is a real crisis. We all have the same interests and the same concerns.” Ostrow is an ICE prosecutor in Miami. … Courtrooms can be cramped as judges, attorneys, family members, experts and others gather for hearings every day. These conditions, said Ostrow, are particularly concerning for ICE prosecutors who in recent days have been panicked, describing people coughing and appearing sick continuing to come to courtrooms. Some state and local governments have begun releasing U.S. criminals amid the virus. WHJL.com reported: Administrative Judge Brendan Sheehan told the I-TEAM earlier this week that inmates are already in poor health, and it wouldn’t take much for the coronavirus to spread wildly behind bars. Sheehan also said almost any kind of inmate could be considered. “You gotta remember, the goal of this is to protect the community and the safety of the inmates. If someone’s a serious violent person, well, we’re using our discretion to make sure the community’s safe also,” he told the I-TEAM on Thursday. 10M+ illegals are mixed in with 315M Americans.

"Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) on Monday called for some very aggressive measures to take on the fallout from the coronavirus threat. Cotton has called for a national “shutdown” and suggested universal basic income as possible measures to be proactive against the virus’ impact on the public. During an appearance on Fox News Channel on Monday afternoon, Cotton acknowledged his proposals were “extraordinary,” but added it was better to overreact than to underreact. “[I]f we take these extraordinary measures, painful though they may be, hardships though they may be, though they may impose, it will arrest the spread of the virus more quickly,” the Arkansas Republican U.S. Senator said. “And that’s ultimately the way we get the economy back on its feet and we get markets back, is to stop the spread of the virus. It’s better to be accused of overreacting in retrospect than underreacting.” “Look at what’s happened in Italy,” Cotton continued. “Two weeks ago, Italians were sitting in cafes, sipping wine and coffee. Today, elderly Italians are being denied care and administered last rites because their health care system is completely overtaxed.

"Ret. Gen. Jack Keane told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump “is on the mark” in addressing the coronavirus outbreak, contrasting the severity of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 and 2010 with the current viral spread. “I think the president is on the mark in dealing with this crisis,” estimated Keane. “I  do think it’s unfortunate that people poke at him a politically, and the fact he’s a Republican shouldn’t be relevant at this point. The nation is facing a crisis. We’ve got a leader in charge of it. Let’s get there and support him whether he’s a Republican or Democrat. That’s the way I think we should be approaching the problem.” LISTEN:
 Keane contrasted the 2009-2010 response to H1N1 swine flu with that of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. “We’ve kind of been here before,” stated Keane. “When we had the H1N1 swine flu in 2009 and ’10, that was a pandemic. Sixty-one million people were infected in the United States — we have thousands infected now [with coronavirus] — and 12,000-plus died of it in that two-year time frame. We didn’t go to battle stations as we seem to be going now and stopping everything from taking place.” Keane continued, “I do think there is something of an overreaction, myself, when I look at it. I don’t think there’s enough emphasis on how many people are actually recovering from this. Some people are talking about the fact that they weren’t even seriously sick, but they had the COVID-19 virus, and they wouldn’t have known that they had it if they had not been tested. They were surprised by it. Now, that’s not all the cases, but it is some of the cases. In fact, in many of the cases the recovery rate is very favorable.” “In the worst case, the CDC saying this is a two percent fatality rate,” Keane remarked. “That’s 98 percent survivability, and they think the denominator isn’t quite right yet because there are more people who have it than what they know, and they think that denominator will change, and it may fall into a category that’s much closer to what the flu is, which is 99.9 percent survivability rate.” The U.S. has already seen 22,000 deaths from the flu during this past flu season. According to the CDC, as of March 7, “So far this season there have been at least 36 million flu illnesses, 370,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths from flu.” Keane advised, “I think we should put more emphasis on … the people who are recovering [from coronavirus] and talk to them. Put them on television, and let them tell their fellow Americans what their experience was like. I heard one on television today, and she didn’t have much of anything. She had a cough, and she’s now fully out riding her mountain bike, and she’s exercising. She’s in her sixties. She was in good shape before she got it, and she’s fit as can be now and enjoying life. More things like that, I think, would help contain people’s concern about this.” Keane concluded, “We’re America. We can deal with this. We’ve got the resources. We’ve got the best healthcare system in the world. We’re, generally speaking, a very healthy people to begin with. We’re gonna be okay.” Trump awarded Keane with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Tuesday. Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

"Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is calling on his successor in the state house to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus by cancelling the state’s primary. Blagojevich, who recently had his prison term commutated by President Donald Trump, issued a statement on Monday urging Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) to postpone the presidential and statewide primaries Illinois has scheduled for Tuesday. In making his argument, Blagovjevich pushed the governor to abide by recent Trump administration guidlines calling on Americans to avoid gatherings of ten-or-more and Pritzker’s own decision to close all restaurants and bars in the state for at least two weeks. “I am calling on Gov. Pritzker to listen to the president’s coronavirus task force, health officials, and the scientists and experts … and immediately postpone tomorrow’s primary,” Blagojevich said. The former governor’s call comes as the coronavirus pandemic reaches new heights. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control announced there were more than 24,000 individuals testing positive for the virus. Although the cases are widespread throughout the country, more densely populated states and regions have seen higher numbers of the virus. Despite the patter, Prtizker, who endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday, has refused suggestions he follow the lead of Louisiana and Georgia by rescheduling the primary for a later date. “To expect people to stand in crowded lines, occupying the same space, and suing the voting equipment is not just irresponsible, its dangerous,” Blagojevich said on Monday, asserting that no “citizen should have to choose between running the risk of infecting themsleves and their loved ones, or participating in the democratic process.” “Politics can wait,” he added. “Public health must come first.” Blagojevich, a Democrat, served as governor of Illinois between 2003 and 2009, when he was impeached and removed from office for public corruption. The story generated widespread media attention, especially after it emerged the governor had attempted to sell the senate seat vacated by Barack Obama upon his election to the presidency. In June 2011, Blagojevich was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison, of which he has served nearly eight. The sentence was considered by many to be unduly harsh, given the former governor’s lack of a criminal record. Since emerging from prison, the former governor has been vocal in his defense of the president and has shown a willingness to call out his own party for its abandonment of blue-collar voters. “When I say I’m a Trumpocrat—and hopefully a lot of others are as well, and I believe they are—it’s largely because the Democratic Party has not only left us, but it’s abandoned traditional Democratic constituencies like working people,” Blagojevich told Breitbart News Saturday last month.",Coronavirus: Rod Blagojevich Urges Illinois to Cancel Primaries,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/16/coronavirus-rod-blagojevich-urges-illinois-to-cancel-primaries/,Breitbart
"Monday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said if President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) did not start acting now on the coronavirus outbreak as a nation “we’re in real trouble.” Warren said, “I start this with let’s learn what we should have learned from the 2008 crash. Part one is when we do a stimulus package, it needs to be big enough to meet the moment. If we fail to do that, we’re not going to get a second bite at it politically, and we’ll have a very long and sluggish recovery if we don’t get it big enough the number is $750 billion. Leader Schumer picked up that number later on today and said that looks like a good number as the starting number. That would be about 3.5% of GDP, which is between the estimates right now of 2% to 5% that this may cost us. Part two is we’ve got to make sure that the money is not going to be treetops, that the money is going to the grassroots. That the critical for strengthening this economy. My main parts here, we need to increase Social Security and Disability payments by $200 a month for the next year, make sure that money is coming in. We need to cancel a chunk of student loan debt would be, on average, $400 a month that would stay in the pockets of people who owe a lot of student loan debt. And we need to be putting money into housing. Use this opportunity to restore, repair housing that needs to be done, public housing, build new housing that gives us jobs in the short run, and it gives us housing we need over a longer ark. Those are the kinds of things we can do to help strengthen this economy from the grassroots up, help rebuild this economy and help stabilize it instead of having it crash further, and we need to start now.” Hayes asked, “As you say, we need to start now. Mitch McConnell sent the Senate home for three days for recess and flew to Kentucky, where he was joined by Brett Kavanaugh for a ceremony for a former Kavanaugh clerk. Do you think that was a wise decision by the Senate Majority Leader?” Warren said, “No, it was absolutely irresponsible of the Senate Leader to do that. He ultimately called everyone in for a vote tonight, a vote that did not occur because he worked out a deal. He had a problem in his own party — a deal that could have been worked out last week. And we have still not moved forward on the coronavirus bill. This makes no sense at all. It’s as if he has no sense of urgency about this problem and no sense of what to do.” She added, “You started this by asking, do I feel better trump has at least admitted there is a problem? Sure. But it’s time to act. We should have been acting months ago, and if that message still has not arrived with the president or Mitch McConnell, then we’re in real trouble.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Warren: If Trump and ‘Irresponsible’ McConnell Don’t Act Now ‘We’re in Real Trouble’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/warren-if-trump-and-irresponsible-mcconnell-dont-act-now-were-in-real-trouble/,Breitbart
"House staffers confirmed on Monday that Democrat House members will indefinitely delay their scheduled March 23 return to the Capitol, due to coronavirus. Aides say Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told House Democrats that the scheduled return will be delayed, with a firm return date still to be determined. “Hoyer said for sure not Monday, and he will update them about the rest of the week,” an aide told The Hill on Monday, adding that travel concerns may affect the decision. “This is all pending domestic travel situation too,” he said The decision arrives at a time when U.S. citizens need action from D.C. leadership more than ever: As the government grapples with appropriate measures to contain the novel coronavirus — and treat its victims — the economy is buckling under the strain. With 40 percent of Americans living just one paycheck away from poverty, taking time off is a life or death decision for people who do not share the luxury of the virtually free health care and paid leave afforded their representatives. Meanwhile, Congress has already passed an $8.3 billion package aimed at addressing the most immediate healthcare concerns, but that is already proving well short of the resources needed. An economic stimulus was passed on Saturday, which Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are already working to correct. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer has also pitched a $750 billion fund for the hospital capacity expansion, bolstering Medicaid coverage, and strengthening unemployment insurance for anyone who loses their job due to the outbreak. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio is focused on keeping the airlines solvent: A source told The Hill that DeFazio “talked about making sure any assistance to airlines puts workers first, and there should be conditions to ensure assistance isn’t used for CEOs or stock buybacks.” It is unclear what effects this indefinite delay in their return will have on these efforts.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden is extending an olive branch to his one time rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), as establishment Democrats look to unify the party and bring the nominating contest to an early conclusion. On Friday, during a virtual town hall with voters in Illinois, Biden announced a major policy shift on bankruptcy reform. While speaking about the burgeoning Coronavirus threat, the former vice president argued that any plan to alleviate the pandemic’s economic impact would have to include an overhaul of personal and student loan bankruptcy laws. Biden did not stop there, though, stating the proposal he had in mind was the same one Warren championed during her failed White House campaign. “I’m going to endorse Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy proposal, which … allows for student debt to be relieved [and] provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us to, in fact, impact how people are dealing with their circumstances,” the former vice president said. He added it was position he likely shared with his progressive rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The political significance of the endorsement was not immediately clear, as much of the news emanating from the town hall focused on its repeated technical difficulties. It does, however, signal that Biden is removing a longstanding point of contention between himself and Warren, likely part of an effort to secure the Massachusett Democrat’s backing. Biden’s courting effort is hinted at by his newfound support for Warren’s bankruptcy proposal, which is nothing short of a repudiation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. That legislation, written in part by Biden, tightened regulations making personal and student loan bankruptcy more difficult. It is widely seen to have benefited credit card companies and big banks at the expense of the average consumer. Some, including Warren, have suggested the law hastened and aggravated the recession of the late 2000s. The story, though, goes much deeper. In 1999, Biden was one of the lead backers of an initial bankruptcy reform package that held many of the provisions that would eventually end up in the 2005 bill. The legislation was a top priority for the banking and credit card interests, specifically MBNA Corp., which at the time was Biden’s largest campaign contributor. Biden, along with a cadre of business-friendly Democrats and Senate Republicans, labored to pass the bill in the face of opposition from liberals and consumer advocates. Among those on the opposing side was then-Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy expert. In opposing the bill, Warren argued the it favored companies like MBNA over working families. After an intense back and forth, Biden’s side prevailed and the bill passed in late 2000. It did not become law, however, as then-President Bill Clinton opted to pocket veto the measure on his way out of office. Biden and his allies were not dispirited by the bill’s failure, instead seizing the opportunity presented by the incoming Republican administration to pass a measure even more beneficial to banking interests. Those efforts ultimately led to the 2005 bill, which only passed after MNBA and other financial giants bankrolled an intense lobbying campaign. The following year, results were evident when bankruptcy filings fell by more than 70 percent. Warren, for her part, has not forgotten Biden’s role in the affair. “At a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hardworking families, Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies,” she said the day after the former vice president entered the 2020 race. Despite the decades-old disagreement, Biden and allies within the Democrat establishment seem to believe an endorsement by Warren is the key to wrapping up the primary. Hopes for a quick conclusion have only grown among establishment Democrats, who fear prolonging the nominating contest will only serve to wound the former vice president in the general election. As such, Warren’s endorsement could prove critical to unifying the party and sapping any remaining momentum Sanders has to fight on. “Sanders would lose a good chunk as a Warren endorsement would signal to progressives that Biden is okay to support,” Colin Strother, a Texas-based political strategist, told Breitbart News. As proof, he pointed to recent polling indicating Sanders narrowly edging out the former vice president as the second choice among Warren supporters. “A Warren endorsement may not result in a huge bump, but the signal would be deafening: Biden is the unity candidate,” he said, noting that a large contingent of Sanders’ “supporters are not really Democrats and do not even identify” as such. Strother added that Biden’s recent actions seemed to imply his campaign had opened up a dialogue with the Massachusetts senator. Although it is unclear if those talks will be successful, Warren at least appears willing to listen. One day before the former vice president endorsed her bankruptcy proposal, Warren’s allies floated to The New York Times that she was unlikely to endorse Sanders, especially as his chances for winning appeared grim. “Why would she want to make her endorsement seem less powerful by giving it to somebody on a downward trajectory,” one of Warren’s allies told the Times.",Biden Offers Warren Olive Branch as Democrats Look to End Primary Early,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/16/biden-offers-warren-olive-branch-as-democrats-look-to-end-primary-early/,Breitbart
"National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera told Breitbart News the “felons only” deportation plan offered by former Vice President Joe Biden will cause a rush to the U.S. The candidate said he would completely halt deportations during his first 100 days and would thereafter only deport felons. “In the first 100 days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all,” Biden said during the Sunday night debate with Senator Bernie Sanders. “From that point on, the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America.” National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol agent currently assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Sector (the nation’s busiest sector), responded to Biden’s pledge, saying, “The rush will come … It’s like ‘we’ll leave the light on for ya.” Cabrera’s comments came on Monday in an interview with Breitbart News Daily’s Alex Marlow. He explained there is normally a border surge in the months leading up to presidential elections as uncertainty builds. “With rhetoric like that,” Cabrera continued, “it’s just going to open the floodgates once again. It will put our guys more at risk and it will put our country more at risk.” “By all means, we need good people coming into this country,” the veteran Border Patrol agent stated, “but you’ve gotta come in the right way, you’ve gotta come in the front door. Not just a blanket ‘everybody comes — nobody leaves — that’s just silly.” Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Marlow reiterated, “All that matters is he’s sending a signal that it’s okay to flood the border. So long as your not a felon, you’re getting in and you’re staying.” Marlow continued, “It’s as though he does not consider that there are human beings whose lives change when he says things like this in order to win the nomination.” Cabrera responded, “It’s very dangerous talk, especially with the fact that some people will do anything to get over here including taking advantage of their fellow man. It puts people in a very bad position.” Click here to listen to Cabrera’s full interview on Breitbart News Today.

"New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (D) signed a coronavirus emergency order last week allowing her to ban the sale and transportation of firearms. She signed a follow-up proclamation on March 16, 2020, further emphasizing her emergency powers to “suspend or limit the sale, dispensing, or transportation, of alcoholic beverages.” The declaration declaring the mayor’s power to restrict gun sales and transportation says she is “empowered, if necessary, to suspend or limit the sale of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives, and combustibles.” On March 16, 2020, the Second Amendment Foundation responded to Cantrell’s claims of emergency powers over firearms by reminding her that they sued over Second Amendment infringement following Hurricane Katrina and will do so during the era of coronavirus if needed. SAF executive vice president Alan Gottlieb said: Following Hurricane Katrina, we sued the city when then-Mayor Ray Nagin’s administration began confiscating firearms from law-abiding citizens for no good reason. The federal court order the city to cease confiscations. We sued New Orleans then, and we’ll do it again. The presence of a nasty disease does not suspend any part of the Bill of Rights, no matter what some municipal, state or even federal politician may think. While we certainly recognize the seriousness of this virus and its ability to spread rapidly, treating Covid-19 and taking steps to prevent it from infecting more people has nothing at all to do with the exercise of the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Gottlieb added, “People legally licensed to carry should not have their right to do so suddenly curtailed because some politician panicked. We didn’t allow it before, and we’re not going to allow it now.” On March 14, 2020, Breitbart News reported that Champaign, Illinois, Mayor Deborah Frank Feinen (D) issued an emergency coronavirus order that gives her the power to halt ammunition and firearm sales in the city.

"During an interview that aired on Monday’s broadcast of Fox Business Network’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) explained what led to his hesitation to support legislation meant to ease the economic blow from coronavirus. Gohmert pointed to a family leave provision in the bill, which only applied to companies with less than 500 employees. Partial transcript as follows: DOBBS: Let’s turn to the coronavirus bill that you — that you put a hold on. Got a deal I understand, but still 20 pages, I’ll bet you that you’re right still, that a lot of folks don’t have any idea what’s in it. GOHMERT: Yes. Well — and that was the problem Friday night. Yes, we voted — started voting around 12:30 A.M. Saturday morning, but that bill didn’t get filed until right before midnight. Now I had — I had read through the 108 pages of the 9 o’clock or so version, but I didn’t have time to compare them and do a side by side. I didn’t know what got changed or what didn’t. But it really bugged me — you know, under Obamacare that passed without a single Republican vote, they exempted all businesses with less than 50 employees. This bill that’s going to force small businesses — one, two, three, up to 50 — well up to 500 actually — employees. They’re going to have to be providing an opportunity to take family leave and all. And — and these are folks — if you’ve got two employees, and you’re going to be able to give them both a month off you’ve got trouble. DOBBS: Let me tell you what, if — if — if the White House — if the White House hasn’t got anymore influence over legislation than that, we’re going to have a real problem come November, because this is a time to be straight up, straight forward for both parties. GOHMERT: That’s right. DOBBS: Now the Democrats are very clearly not. The Republicans had better be and follow this president’s lead. GOHMERT: Well, how ironic, Lou, that this bill exempts the corporations with over 500 employees. How about that? They were — what is the deal? They were — they complain about the big corporations, and yet they exempted them and they said, well, a lot of them already have paid family leave. DOBBS: Right.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio flouted his own city’s coronavirus guidelines to work out at the Brooklyn YMCA on Monday morning. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is already facing sharp criticism for his response — or relative lack thereof — to the novel coronavirus, officially classified as “COVID-19,” global pandemic. De Blasio has, until Monday, resisted school closures, putting millions of families at risk of exposure to the contagion. The mayor took so long to course-correct that upset staffers reportedly chose to quit rather than continue supporting his leadership. “We understand the immense disruption this will create for our families,” United Federation of Teachers president Michael Mulgrew said. “But right now, more than a million students and staff crisscross the city every day on their way to schools, putting themselves and others at risk of exposure and increasing the likelihood of bringing exposure into their homes and communities.” And despite declaring the pandemic a “war” over which the federal government should “take over” on Sunday and making a case for government nationalization of “crucial factories and industries” to produce medical supplies, de Blasio does not appear to believe these rules should necessarily apply to him. Our crazy Mayor, as he's deciding to close all the gyms, because they're not safe…………goes to the gym to workout: https://t.co/sKBGY1k3Xs — MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) March 16, 2020  “Our crazy Mayor, as he’s deciding to close all the gyms, because they’re not safe … goes to the gym to workout,” New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday, linking to a report by the New York Post. He is far from the only one shocked by the decision. De Blasio’s own people have called him out. “He went to the f–king gym? Jesus!” said a former staff member. Another told the Post, “every New Yorker’s regular routine has been put on hold. His should be, too. Get to work. Set an example. This is embarrassing.” Yet another questioned his unwillingness to adhere to CDC guidelines, telling the paper: Didn’t the CDC recommend no gatherings of 50 people or more? … Will he be counting the amount of people there and leaving if it’s over 49? If we’re supposed to be social distancing, then what does that even mean if he gets to play by his own rules? Leaders are supposed to set by example. What kind of example does this set? Also, why is he at the gym and not hunkered down 24/7 working on this? It’s a pandemic, and people are dying. Stunning. How many people have to die before he stops getting chauffeured to the gym is my question. What’s the appropriate number of deaths before he finds it uncouth? De Blasio’s press secretary, Freddi Goldstein, defended the mayor’s risky decision. “The YMCA has been a huge part of his and his family’s life, like it has been for a lot of New Yorkers. It’s clear that’s about to change and before that, the mayor wanted to visit a place that keeps him grounded one last time,” Goldstein said. “That doesn’t change the fact that he is working around the clock to ensure the safety of New Yorkers. After today, gyms will close and he will no longer be visiting the YMCA for the foreseeable future.” After his 12-mile trip to his favorite gym, de Blasio finally decided it was time to make sure the children of New York had adequate protection. “It is time to take more drastic measures,” de Blasio said during an update at City Hall Sunday evening, announcing that schools would be closed until at least April 20. “This is a decision I have taken with no joy whatsoever.” But NYC Council Member Keith Powers implored de Blasio to live by his own words. “As elected officials, we’re expected to lead and set an example for the public,” he wrote. “We’re in a public health crisis, where gyms and restaurants are closing. Our message to everyone is to stay home. Mr. Mayor, we need you to lead by example.”",NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio Ignores Coronavirus Rules to Hit the Gym,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio-ignores-coronavirus-rules-to-hit-the-gym/,Breitbart

"The local Illinois news station WCIA mistakenly aired Election Day results on Monday, showing former Vice President Joe Biden (D) winning, the day before the state’s Tuesday primary election. A video went viral on Monday, showing WCIA airing Tuesday’s election results during a Monday showing of The Price is Right. The results showed Biden defeating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) by just over 93,000 votes. “While watching The Price is Right our station accidentally runs tomorrow’s election results … its [sic] Monday our election in Illinois is tomorrow,” the woman, Sherry Daughtery, wrote alongside a video:  She updated her post with a statement from Mark Maxwell, the station’s Capitol Bureau Chief, who said it was nothing more than a “routine test” rehearsal. Airing the dry run, he said, was an error. He stressed that the numbers were not based on any actual polling returns and added that the station “never intended to give the wrong information or wrong impression”: We do routine test rehearsals before every election to make sure the graphics work properly and to give directors some practice. The error was in putting the dry run on air. That shouldn’t have happened and we’re looking into it. Obviously, we never intended to give the wrong information or wrong impression. None of those numbers were based on any real polling returns. Since your post is being widely shared, I’d appreciate it if you would consider updating the original post so people don’t get the wrong idea. Breitbart News reached out to Maxwell, who verified that he did, in fact, make a “truthful” statement. Officials in Illinois have not canceled the state’s primary election, despite Gov. J.B. Pritzker taking drastic measures by announcing the closure of restaurants and bars across the state as fears over the coronavirus continue to mount. Pritzker remained confident in holding the election as scheduled, telling NBC’s Meet the Press that officials have been “extra-careful at all of our polling places.”  “Everybody is practicing good hygiene. And we’re making sure that it’s safe for people to come and vote,” he said on Sunday. “The schools are closed, so many people will be voting in schools.

"At least eight New York Times authors shared a deceptively edited quote Monday from President Donald Trump’s recent call with state governors, creating the false impression that the president is denying federal support for ventilators that are needed in hospitals treating coronavirus patients. In his message, the president recommended that states procure respirators and ventilators because it would be faster — but added that the federal government “will be backing you.” The Times journalists omitted the bulk of the president’s statement as they shared the story on social media. The misleading, partial quote was also boosted by a CNN correspondent and became the lead headline at the left-wing Huffington Post. Despite growing online backlash to this misinformation, the journalists have yet to delete or retract their comments. The eight journalists tweeted a link to a Times article published Monday that contains President Trump’s full statement to state governors in which the president recommended that they shouldn’t wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to treat people with coronavirus. “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” President Trump told the governors during the Monday conference call. “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” But in the body of their posts, the Times journalists left out most of what the president said. Times national correspondent Julie Bosman tweeted only the first third of the president’s statement, leaving out the part where he said the federal government will back the states. Wow. “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call. via @jmartNYT  https://t.co/RKZusLK5oY — Julie Bosman (@juliebosman) March 16, 2020  Bosman, reacting to intense backlash, defended herself by inaccurately claiming that “the second part of the quote repeats the first part, twice.” In fact, the second part of the president’s statement says that the federal government “will be backing you [the states].” because the second part of the quote repeats the first part, twice. — Julie Bosman (@juliebosman) March 16, 2020  Mara Gay, a member of the Times editorial board, also left out most of what the president said. She also falsely accused the president of telling governors that  “they are on their own.” In actuality, the president said in his full quote that the federal government “will be backing you.” Trump told governors this morning they are on their own:  “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times. https://t.co/K0sont7MBc — Mara Gay (@MaraGay) March 16, 2020  Just ten days ago, Gay was involved in another embarrassing episode for corporate media, where she and MSNBC anchor Brian Williams horribly botched basic math to claim that billionaire Michael Bloomberg could have “given every American a million dollars.” In reality, the amount he spent amounts to less than $2 per person.

"President Donald Trump has made significant strides in the energy sector, including making the United States the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world, but at the Democrat debate on Sunday both candidates vowed to dismantle those gains in the name of climate change and the “corporate greed” of fossil fuel producers. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) both promised to “take on the fossil fuel industry,” including ending hydraulic fracking that had enhanced production and reduced emissions, shutting down coal plants, and ending drilling for oil and gas on public lands. “This is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines,” Sanders said. “What this is about transforming our energy system, as quickly as we humanly can, away from fossil fuel.” “It is insane that we continue to have fracking in America,” Sanders said. “Number one, no more subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one,” Biden said. He added: Number two, we’re in a situation, as well, where we cannot — we — we are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic in terms of what we can do to set in motion — the fact that he says climate change, Paris Accord doesn’t mean much — we can get everything exactly right.

Biden said he would call on the Department of Defense to fight the “national security” threat of climate change and claimed “islands are sinking.” As Breitbart News reported during the American Conservative Union’s 2020 CPAC convention last month in Oxon Hill, Maryland, Department of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told Breitbart News Daily about Trump’s vision for a “secure, energy independent” nation. “Here’s the contrast,” Bernhardt said. “The socialists have come up with the concept of the great Green New Deal.” “Which, really, they even admit, is a policy to control the lives of Americans,” Bernhardt said. “You contrast that with President Trump’s vision for America, which has been to unleash our energy potential on federal lands and eliminate the paralysis by analysis that’s been caused by regulation.” “Regulations have literally gotten to the point where they were so burdensome that they were freezing the government from making decisions,” Bernhardt said. “And the president came in and said, ‘Look, let’s ensure that we have clean air, clean water, health, and human safety, but let’s find a way to do those things — maintain those values — and at the same time have a common sense approach to the business that we need to have in our country to fast-track economic opportunity, to develop natural resources.’” Bernhardt said over the past three years his agency has worked to “dramatically modify our regulatory paradigm in a way that didn’t sacrifice those high values but at the same time dramatically has allowed us speed up our decision making process.” “The United States has become a net energy exporter, which was really not thought of years ago,” Bernhardt said. “And largely because of American innovation and technology through the utilization of new development techniques, and those techniques started in the mid-2000s and really benefited private land.” “When we come into office the president recognized that there was an opportunity for those technologies to be more utilized on public land,” Bernhardt said, referring to hydraulic fracturing, a technology that has been around since 1862 but reached its peak performance over the last few decades. As the largest manager of land in the United States, DOI has a huge responsibility, Bernhardt said. “Interior alone manages one of every five acres of land in the United States,” Bernhardt said.  “What we’ve done responsibly is allow people to move forward with proposals that have dramatically improved things,” Bernhardt said. “This year for the first time ever we had on federal lands and Indian lands that we manage together over one billion barrels of oil were produced.” Bernhardt said that DOI has increased the number of permits for drilling wells by 300 percent. “And the revenue to the American public has dramatically increased — nearly doubled,” Bernhardt said, adding that energy independence has also bolstered national security when the United States is not dependent on nations that may not have our country’s best interests in mind. “We have fundamentally changed the game and that is really a testament to [Trump’s] belief in American innovation, American technology and [a] commonsense regulatory paradigm,” Bernhardt said. Bernhardt also said at CPAC that President Donald Trump has made it a priority to give Americans access to federal lands for both pleasure and business: In keeping with that goal, Bernhardt said that his agency is committed to making sure that 245 million acres in the western United States be “specifically designated to be managed for multiple use.” “We’ve expanded by 1.4 million acres this last year as opportunities for hunting and fishing on public lands and in forests, but more importantly we have ensured the concept of multiple use is embodied,” Bernhardt said. “So we are open for business in many places for public lands and at the same time ensuring that we maintain our conservation stewardship,” Bernhardt said.  Follow Penny Starr on Twitter","Sanders, Biden Vow at Democrat Debate to Undo U.S. Energy Independence",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/sanders-biden-vow-at-democrat-debate-to-undo-u-s-energy-independence/,Breitbart

"In another desperate attempt by the Clinton machine to delay truth and accountability for her email conduct and how it impacted the people’s “right to know” under FOIA, lawyers for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills have asked the Court of Appeals to overturn a U.S. District court order granting Judicial Watch’s request for their depositions about Clinton’s emails and Benghazi attack records. Lawyers for Clinton and Mills filed a “Petition for Writ of Mandamus” earlier today. The Clinton request comes in Judicial Watch’s lawsuit that seeks records concerning “talking points or updates on the Benghazi attack” (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01242)). Judicial Watch famously uncovered in 2014 that the “talking points” that provided the basis for Susan Rice’s false statements were created by the Obama White House. This Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit led directly to the disclosure of the Clinton email system in 2015. On March 3, 2020, Judge Lamberth granted Judicial Watch’s request to depose Clinton about her emails and Benghazi attack documents. The court also ordered the deposition of Mills and two other State Department officials. Additionally, the court granted Judicial Watch’s request to subpoena Google for relevant documents and records associated with Clinton’s emails during her tenure at the State Department. In December 2018, Judge Lamberth first ordered discovery into whether Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server was intended to stymie FOIA; whether the State Department’s intent to settle this case in late 2014 and early 2015 amounted to bad faith; and whether the State Department has adequately searched for records responsive to Judicial Watch’s request. The court also authorized discovery into whether the Benghazi controversy motivated the cover-up of Clinton’s email. The court ruled that the Clinton email system was “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.” The State and Justice Departments continued to defend Clinton’s and the agency’s email conduct. Judge Lamberth overruled Clinton’s and the State and Justice Department’s objections to limited additional discovery by first noting: Discovery up until this point has brought to light a noteworthy amount of relevant information, but Judicial Watch requests an additional round of discovery, and understandably so. With each passing round of discovery, the Court is left with more questions than answers. Additionally, Judge Lamberth said that he is troubled by the fact that both the State Department and Department of Justice want to close discovery in this case: [T]here is still more to learn. Even though many important questions remain unanswered, the Justice Department inexplicably still takes the position that the court should close discovery and rule on dispositive motions. The Court is especially troubled by this. To argue that the Court now has enough information to determine whether State conducted an adequate search is preposterous, especially when considering State’s deficient representations regarding the existence of additional Clinton emails. Instead, the Court will authorize a new round of discovery … With respect to Clinton, the court found that her prior testimony, mostly through written sworn answers, was not sufficient: The Court has considered the numerous times in which Secretary Clinton said she could not recall or remember certain details in her prior interrogatory answers. In a deposition, it is more likely that plaintiff’s counsel could use documents and other testimony to attempt to refresh her recollection. And so, to avoid the unsatisfying and inefficient outcome of multiple rounds of fruitless interrogatories and move this almost six-year-old case closer to its conclusion, Judicial Watch will be permitted to clarify and further explore Secretary Clinton’s answers in person and immediately after she gives them. The Court agrees with Judicial Watch – it is time to hear directly from Secretary Clinton. Judicial Watch will continue the fight to hold Clinton accountable and to bring out the truth for all to see.",Fitton: Hillary Clinton Appeals Federal Court Order to Go Under Oath,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/fitton-hillary-clinton-appeals-federal-court-order-to-go-under-oath/,Breitbart
"Thousands of foreign nationals have been caught attempting to cross into the United States from Canada before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would close the nation’s borders to foreign travelers. On Monday, Trudeau said he would be shutting down Canada’s borders to non-citizens with exemptions for permanent Canadian residents, diplomats, aircrews, and American citizens. Before the announcement, Trudeau had not issued a single travel ban — not even for China, Iran, South Korea, or Italy. Federal data obtained by Breitbart News shows that nearly 10,400 foreign nationals were deemed inadmissible or apprehended at the U.S.-Canada border in January and February. In January, alone, northern border agents encountered nearly 3,600 foreign nationals. In February, northern border agents apprehended 259 foreign nationals and declared 6,540 inadmissible. These inadmissible numbers and apprehensions do not include the foreign nationals who have arrived at northern border ports of entry and have successfully entered the U.S. President Trump said his administration is considering closing the northern border as the number of coronavirus cases in Canada climbs to 304. Thus far, there has been one death from the coronavirus in Canada. “We think about it … if we don’t have to do it, that would be very good,” Trump said when asked if he would close the northern border. “… We’re talking about different things.” As Breitbart News reported, the U.S.-Mexico border has been inundated with foreign nationals from coronavirus-affected countries. Since October, nearly 151,000 foreign nationals from 72 countries with confirmed coronavirus cases have flocked to the southern border. Within the last few months, more than 340 Chinese nationals have attempted to cross illegally into the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Over 450 employees of Duval County Public Schools (DCPS), covering the school district in Jacksonville, Florida, have reported the need to self-quarantine, according to local media. The development follows a recent survey asking employees to indicate their whereabouts over spring break. As such, the district has asked “any students, teachers or staff returning from foreign travel to any country or anyone who returns from a cruise, anywhere” to remain in self-isolation for two weeks, according to News4Jax. The DCPS states on its website in a note to parents and families: If you have traveled out of the continental United States, if you have been on a cruise, or if a member of your close family participated in any such travel, you must not return to school until you have self-isolated for 14 days and you are symptom-free. According to Action News Jax, the employees “have been provided guidance from Dr. Diana Greene, according to the district.” Meanwhile, the district has announced that it will provide “grab and go” school lunches for all students beginning March 17. The news comes as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis orders schools across the state to extend their spring breaks by a week amid festering coronavirus concerns.

"President Trump’s coronavirus travel bans have been effective in refusing air travel entry to the United States for Chinese nationals, Iranian nationals, and recent visitors to either of those countries. On January 31, Trump announced a travel ban on Chinese nationals and foreign travelers who had visited China within the last 14 days. There are now nearly 81,000 coronavirus cases in China and 3,213 deaths. About a month later, Trump expanded the travel ban to include Iran, where more than 850 have died from the Wuhan, China, virus. Between February 2 and March 12, Trump’s travel bans have made sure a total of about 143 foreign air travelers — who have visited or resided in China or Iran  — were not allowed entry to the U.S., according to federal data obtained by Breitbart News. At American airports, 18 foreign nationals were refused entry to the U.S. over the last five weeks. Meanwhile, 125 foreign nationals were denied from ever boarding U.S.-bound flights thanks to the travel ban restrictions. These denials were conducted during pre-clearance locations at international airports. Breitbart News previously reported on the latest number of denials of entry at land ports of entry thanks to the travel ban restrictions, where nearly 240 foreign nationals were kept out of the U.S. This brings the total of foreign nationals refused entry to the U.S. due to the travel bans, via land ports of entry and air travel, to 380 thus far. This data does not include the number of Europeans and recent European travelers who will have been kept from entering the U.S. because that travel ban went into effect on Friday, March 13. While the Trump administration has implemented the travel bans and stopped most migration from highly-affected coronavirus countries, about 220 House Democrats have sought to strip the president of his authority to enact travel bans. The “No Ban Act,” introduced by Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA) would have prevented Trump from immediately implementing a travel ban on China once the outbreak of the coronavirus spread past its origins of Wuhan. Instead, the No Ban Act would have allowed travelers from Wuhan, Iran, Italy, and all of Europe to continue to arrive in the U.S. while the president received guidance from Congress. The leading 2020 Democrats for president, Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have both vowed not to implement travel bans if they are president — even in cases like the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Biden’s “combat coronavirus” plan did not include a single travel ban — not even for Wuhan, where the virus originated — while Sanders has explicitly said he would not close the nation’s borders to any country if elected president.

"Former Department of Justice prosecutor Jonathan Kravis, one of four prosecutors who withdrew from the Roger Stone case last month after President Donald Trump criticized their recommended sentence, appears to have a history of asking for long sentences in politically controversial cases. Kravis, who not only left the case but also left government altogether, joined his team in recommending a seven- to nine-year sentence for Stone, a first offender. As Breitbart News reported: “Stone was convicted in November on seven criminal counts, including making false statements to Congress regarding his communications with WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential election, tampering with witness Randy Credico, and obstructing the House investigation into the president’s now-debunked coordination with Russia.” But the lengthy sentence drew criticism — including from President Trump himself. Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature, yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee, that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp! @foxandfriends @TuckerCarlson — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2020  Attorney General William Barr intervened, and Stone was ultimately sentenced to 40 months. Barr said that Trump had not influenced his decision, and took the unusual step of criticizing the president’s tweets on ABC News. Jury foreperson Tomeka Hart then outed herself in a Facebook post defending the prosecutors. That, in turn, revealed her own history as a Democratic Party politician, and her intense bias against Trump. Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, who has specialized in appeals by defendants against convictions in similar cases, said that Stone deserved a new trial. Kravis and his fellow prosecutors nonetheless remained heroes in the eyes of much of the mainstream media. In 2016, Kravis was involved in the prosecution of Herbert Vederman, the former deputy mayor of Philadelphia, who was convicted of bribing former Congressman Chaka Fattah, who was also convicted. Vederman was sentenced to 24 months in prison — four times the maximum sentence provided in the federal guidelines, which is six months. Vederman’s conviction was overturned in 2019. He was set to face a new trial, but decided to strike a plea deal for one year in prison instead. However, the judge threw out the deal and sentenced Vederman to two years anyway, after prosecutors recommended a sentence of at least 24 months. Vederman has petitioned for commutation of his sentence, telling the Office of the Pardon Attorney, “Mr. Kravis’s record should be investigated, and my sentence should be commuted.” Kravis also prosecuted three former campaign staffers for Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) for crimes involved in an effort to entice an Iowa politician to switch his endorsement to Paul from presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) in the 2012 Republican primary. Several of the charges were dismissed by a federal judge “because they were based on information the government obtained during F.B.I. interviews last year that the judge said was not admissible,” the New York Times reported. (The three were later convicted in another trial.) It is not clear bias played a role in the Stone prosecution. But the media rush to defend the prosecutors and to impugn Barr’s motives ignored the question of possible bias entirely. Joel B.

"Immigration advocates are worrying out loud that China’s Wuhan epidemic will reduce public support for migration into the United States. “The Coronavirus Is Killing Globalization as We Know It,” says a headline at ForeignPolicy.com by Phillippe Legrain, a self-described “cosmopolitan” supporter of migration, and an aide to left-wing European politicians. “The outbreak has been a gift to nativist nationalists and protectionists, and it is likely to have a long-term impact on the free movement of people and goods,” Legrai worried in a March 12 article. He continued: Much of this disruption may be temporary. But the coronavirus crisis is likely to have a lasting impact, especially when it reinforces other trends that are already undermining globalization. It may deal a blow to fragmented international supply chains, reduce the hypermobility of global business travelers, and provide political fodder for nationalists who favor greater protectionism and immigration controls. … Once the pandemic and panic abate, those who believe that openness to people and products from around the world is generally a good thing will need to make the case for it in fresh and persuasive ways. The worries were echoed by Ali Noorani, director of the National Immigration Forum. This pro-migration group is subsidized by employers who are eager to hire refugees and migrants at wages far below the income sought by American parents. The 1918 flu helped build public support for the 1925 Immigration Act that drastically reduced the flow of migrants, he warned in Medium.com, adding: All of this was long before our globalized, integrated, economy; before the information bubbles that sharply define public opinion; and, most importantly, before the rise of today’s powers that look to demagogue immigrants and immigration. Already, one side of the narrative is shaped by claims the virus came from a backward, corrupt, unclean China, facilitated by Democrats’ open-borders ideology, only to be stopped by travel bans. What is stopping the rhetoric getting even worse? Noorani’s NIF is backed by companies such as Walmart, because it helps raise the labor supply and the inflow of new consumers. He and his allies are already facing growing public opposition to legal and illegal migration, which transfers wealth from young wage-earners to older shareholders, and from the heartland to the coastal states. As Trump and the federal government try to mitigate the disease via “social distancing,” Noorani writes: a consequence of social distancing is, well, social distancing. As Lyman Stone wrote in Foreign Policy, “Bereft of work, school, public gatherings, sports and hobbies, or even the outside world at all, humans do poorly. We need the moral and mental support of communities to be the decent people we all aspire to be.” Churches take their services online, schools close, sporting events are shuttered. The political and social divide that defines our times grows wider. Into the [political] vacuum created by these necessary measures [against the disease] will step powerful forces. Their goal will be to breed mistrust, fan the flames of xenophobia and turn Americans against “the other.” Democrats have begun trying to prevent any political link between Americans’ immigration policy and the Chinese epidemic, usually by stigmatizing critics of migration as mentally ill “xenophobes.” “The global response to COVID-19 has made clear that the fear of contracting disease has an ugly cousin: xenophobia,” claimed a March 4 report at NPR. “As the coronavirus has spread from China to other countries, anti-Asian discrimination has followed closely behind.” “Nationalism is the exactly wrong approach to take to a global pandemic, where the solution requires a worldwide pooling of medical resources,” the Nation declared March 13, as many nations around the world shut their borders to foreign travelers. “We have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus,” Biden said in Iowa, according to a February 1 report in TheHill.com. “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.” Other migration activists are hoping the China-origin crisis will help them import more migrants, including Chinese migrants. “As Congress prepares a legislative response to the [coronavirus] crisis, it should consider completely exempting all pharmaceutical researchers and scientists as well as doctors and physicians from the H-1B and green card limits and expediting their processing,” says an op-ed by David Bier, an advocate at the Cato Institute. The institute is a libertarian advocacy center founded by an open borders champion, Charles Koch. The federal government should respond to the epidemic by putting roughly 1.2 million Indians — some of whom are doctors — on a fast-track to green cards and citizenship, says Immigration Voice, an activist group for Indian contract workers who hold white-collar jobs in the United States. The group is aggressively lobbying for passage of a Senate bill S.386, by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), that would reward hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates for taking jobs from American graduates. The lobbying is directed at Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill), who recognizes that the gain for Silicon Valley’s imported Indian workforce would shrink the supply of green cards for scientists and graduates from many other countries. “83% of doctoral-level foreign scientists hired by pharmaceutical companies were not in the major [Indian] group of the current green card backlog,” said a tweet by one of the many grassroots groups opposing the Lee S.386 bill. “S.386 will eliminate all of these important scientific human resources of the U.S.” Cato & Koch: Never lose an opportunity to cut salaries for American graduates. FWIW, Congress allows non-profit research centers to hire an unlimited number of foreign grads in place of US grads.

"Trump administration officials warned the public on Monday that a foreign disinformation campaign is trying to incite panic over a non-existent national lockdown over coronavirus. An unnamed “senior official” told Fox News that “there is an ongoing effort to spread disinformation and cause undue panic” among U.S. citizens, but confirmed, “there is no national quarantine for the United States.” Now, more than ever, “it’s important we remain vigilant in ensuring our information is coming from verified sources,” they said. The Associated Press received similar communication from the White House, warning of “a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to sow fears of a nationwide quarantine amid the virus outbreak.” These officials also spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to name the source of the campaign. On Sunday, the National Security Council tweeted: “Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown,” and encouraged Americans to pay attention to CDC guidance instead. Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE.

The aggressor then, too, remained unidentified. “U.S. officials have not yet confirmed who was behind the HHS hacking. The hack yesterday involved overloading the HHS servers with millions of hits over several hours,” Bloomberg learned from unnamed sources. At his Monday press briefing, even President Donald Trump alluded to foreign powers “playing games” with coronavirus information. He confirmed that there were no nationwide travel restrictions and that even domestic travel continues as normal, aside from screenings. Still, he told Americans that he and the experts are “talking about it every day.”",Report: Foreign Coronavirus Disinformation Campaign Trying to Cause U.S. Panic,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/report-foreign-coronavirus-disinformation-campaign-trying-to-cause-u-s-panic/,Breitbart
"The Pentagon said Monday it has not yet received any requests from other government agencies for medical facilities, equipment, and personnel, but is looking at options to help deal with a potential coronavirus crisis in the United States if needed. Chief Pentagon Spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman said: We are looking at a number of different options with regard to resources and what we can do. We’ve done that analysis and are continuing to do it, and…it can be provided up to the president and the White House for making decisions as requests come in. Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Fredrichs, surgeon at the Joint Staff, added: “Yes we do have plans looking at the capabilities that we have and then if we’re asked to provide them or if we’re tasked to say what’s in the realm of the possible, we can look at those plans.” Both officials, however, underlined that there are limits to the what the military can provide, and that it could come with tradeoffs. Fredrichs said, for instance, if military reserve medical personnel are activated, that takes them away from their civilian medical job. “That directly impacts the community where they work. That’s the tradeoff,” he said. Fredrichs said there are only 36 Pentagon hospitals in the United States that are “relatively small hospitals,” or under 1,000 beds. He said many of them are configured to support military needs. Civilian leaders have been increasingly pressing for military intervention. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo urged in an op-ed to President Trump on Monday morning that the military build hospital beds. Hoffman said the Pentagon has not yet received a request to construct anything. He said: We have not received an RFA or request to actually do any construction, that would be something that we would look at. At this time I think there are some other options out there that we’ve seen, private companies that are able to do some of the construction, there are other facilities, but we have not been asked to take a look at that yet but we are standing by to look at RFAs as they come and work with the White House on deciding how we best support those. And Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Sunday during a debate called for the military to provide 500-bed hospital tents. Hoffman said the Pentagon is looking into how fast those could be deployed, but he and Fredrichs also warned against “overpromising.” Fredrichs said: We want to be factual about what we have, our fixed facilities are designed to the force that we have — they’re not 1,000-bed medical centers all over the United States. Our deployable hospitals range in size and range in capabilities and are very focused and designed to take care of those in combat. Hoffman added that with regards to tent hospitals, personnel is a limiting factor. “Even if we are able to build tents for hospitals, we still need the doctors, we still need the nurses, we need the orderlies, we need the equipment — all that in there, and as the general mentioned, those individuals from our system would come from existing hospitals or the reserves.” He said the Pentagon has only two to three percent of hospital beds compared to what the civilian side has. As far as how many ventilators the Pentagon could provide, Hoffman said the department is not prepared to give that number out, since it would expose deployable medical capability. On whether the military could be asked to perform law enforcement functions, Hoffman said, “The governors have the ability to call up the National Guard as they see fit.”   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Pentagon Looking at Options to Help Coronavirus Response,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/pentagon-looking-at-options-to-help-coronavirus-response/,Breitbart
"The world must look to China, pay attention and follow its principles in order to halt the global spread of the coronavirus, the official Communist China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday. Despite the fact coronavirus was first discovered last year in the city of Wuhan, where officials tried for six weeks to conceal the deadly outbreak, China is increasingly trying to recast itself as a global leader on the treatment of the pandemic. To that end it is issuing guidance and instruction for other countries to follow, with the full support of the United Nations and World Health Organization functionaries, although not everyone is buying the propaganda push: Sen. @MarcoRubio is standing up against the communist Chinese regime.  https://t.co/RtvEKRW9CA — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 17, 2020  The China Daily editorial said Singapore, Japan and South Korea had all “based their responses on the experience and lessons drawn from China’s successful battle with the virus”, and China was now “proactively sharing” its best practices. At the same time the Communist regime is disappointed not all countries are paying attention, increasing the possibility that the epidemic will get worse, the newspaper said: Despite the unmistakable seriousness of the situation, some countries have tried to play down the risks, and the measures they have taken are not only insufficient to control the pandemic at home, but also not enough to prevent themselves from being the source of virus transmission to other countries. Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday attempts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to curb the Wuhan virus would not succeed, and could lead to retaliation. His appeal drew a sharp response from Pompeo who conveyed “strong objections” to Yang over what the State Department described as “PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” as Breitbart News reported. Over the past few weeks, Chinese officials and state-managed social media accounts began floating theories that the coronavirus began in the United States and was brought to Wuhan by U.S. Army soldiers visiting for the Military World Games in October. Thursday’s allegations from the Chinese Foreign Ministry that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in America and was spread to China by the U.S. military was not a fluke or an example of a rogue spokesman running his mouth. https://t.co/1Jt5KSCYpo — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 14, 2020  On Monday a major Chinese Communist Party paper, the Global Times, stated again – without evidence – the virus might have been developed in the U.S. Army laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, before being secretly released to harm an innocent and entirely helpless mainland Chinese populace.","China Commands World to Pay Attention, Follow Its Lead in Coronavirus Fight",2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/17/china-commands-world-to-pay-attention-follow-its-lead-in-coronavirus-fight/,Breitbart
"Devout Muslim Shiite followers in Iran fought their way into two major shrines closed over coronavirus fears, Iranian state media reported Tuesday, as they demanded the right to continue worshipping practices that include kissing, touching and in some cases licking sacred public objects. As the Islamic Republic pressed on with its struggle to control the Mideast’s worst Chinese coronavirus outbreak, angry crowds stormed into the courtyards of Mashhad’s Imam Reza shrine and Qom’s Fatima Masumeh shrine. The faithful typically pray there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, touching and kissing the shrine. That’s worried health officials, who for weeks ordered Iran’s Shiite clergy to shutter them. Earlier on Monday, the state TV had announced the shrines’ closure, sparking the mass protests. “We are here to say that Tehran is damn wrong to do that!” one Shiite cleric shouted at the shrine in Mashhad, according to online video. Others joined him in chanting: “The health minister is damn wrong to do that, the president is damn wrong to do that!” As Breitbart News reported, strict Muslim religious observance has clashed before with state control in Iran. Earlier this month online videos emerged showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they have no fear of infection during the country’s escalating coronavirus outbreak. More videos are emerging of people licking the shrines in the city of Qom #CoronaVirus, the epicentre of the epidemic in Iran.  Iran's authorities still adamantly refuse to close these religious sites. The virus is wreaking havoc all over the country pic.twitter.com/veCQd6ots6 — Masih Alinejad 🏳️ (@AlinejadMasih) March 1, 2020  Touching and kissing surfaces in shrines is a common practice for Muslim pilgrims, and religious hardliners argue the holy sites of Qom are “a place for healing” that the government has no right to close down. Iran’s shrines draw Shiites from all over the Mideast for pilgrimages, likely contributing to the spread of the virus across the region. Saudi Arabia earlier closed off Islam’s holiest sites over fear of the virus spreading. President Hassan Rouhani said despite the closures, “our soul is closer to the saints more than at any time.” Iran warned Monday the coronavirus pandemic could overwhelm local health facilities as the death toll topped 700 and another senior lawmaker died from the disease, as Breitbart News reported.

"Britain’s Chief Scientific Adviser has told the public that the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus is a “national effort” in which everyone must play a part. “We have now entered the delay phase of this pandemic and we want to delay the spread and reduce its effects,” wrote Sir Patrick Vallance, who is also head of the Government Science and Engineering (GSE) profession, in an article published on the Government’s website. “This is response to the current spread of the disease in the UK that reflects the fact that we are few weeks behind some countries in terms of the outbreak of the disease [sic],” he added. The former GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) research and development executive stressed that “we need… experts more than ever… we need their voices, and their advice, to be full, frank and honest” — but the question of why the Government did not take steps to end travel from China, Iran, Italy, and other heavily-infected countries long ago in order to slow the virus’s arrival and spread in the United Kingdom, went unanswered. It's time, to paraphrase @realDonaldTrump, for a complete shutdown of travel from China until our countries' representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. #coronavirus #wuhan  https://t.co/ebC1T8U42S — Jack Montgomery (@JackBMontgomery) January 28, 2020  “We all have a crucial part to play” in “taking steps to squash the peak” of the epidemic, Sir Patrick told readers, stating that the coronavirus “is a mild disease in most people” but adding that it was nevertheless “paramount that we do everything possible to protect ourselves, to protect others, and protect the NHS.” In terms of practical steps to, as he put it, “squash the peak”, his advice to people with coronavirus symptoms was to stay at home for seven days, while for the rest of the public the advice was much the same as always: For people without symptoms we have 4 simple words of advice: Keep. Washing. Your. Hands. Wash them often, wash them even when wouldn’t you normally wash them, and wash them with soap for 20 seconds at a time. I’ve opted for Prince’s, Raspberry Beret as my own personal handwash song [sic]. You can choose your own. After Sir Patrick’s article was published on the gov.uk website, however, the Government’s advice has escalated, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sir Patrick, and Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty giving a press conference later that same day saying it was now time for “drastic action”. The trio advised people with coronavirus symptoms to self-isolate along with the rest of their household for 14 days — up from seven — and advised all members of the public to “stop non-essential contact with others and to stop unnecessary travel”. “We need people to start working from home where they possibly can and you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres, and other such social venues,” the Prime Minister said, adding that the state would “no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do” — but declining to ban them. Despite the advice to “stop unnecessary travel” the borders do remain open, also — although in practice many of the countries most likely to be vectors for new cases have largely shut down outgoing flights.

"President Donald Trump hit New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Twitter Tuesday for criticizing his handling of the coronavirus crisis. “Andrew, keep politics out of it…” Trump wrote on Twitter. The New York Governor continues to criticize Trump publicly for failing to level nationwide orders restricting American behavior and close bars and restaurants. Trump reminded Cuomo all states had different levels of the coronavirus. “Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,” Trump wrote. “New York is a very big ‘hotspot,’ West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases,” he said. Speaking on his brother Chris Cuomo’s show on CNN, the New York governor presented himself as a truth-teller to the president, leading the nation in the fight against the epidemic. “You have to know how to mobilize the federal government,” Cuomo said. “You have to know how to manage the government.” Cuomo also faulted the president for failing to order the Army Corps of Engineers to construct temporary hospitals. During his press conference on Monday, Trump said Cuomo should be doing more to fight the virus. “I think he can do more,” he said, repeating a message he wrote on Twitter hours earlier. “And, you know, it’s an area of the country that’s very hot right now.” Cuomo wants “all states to be treated the same.” But all states aren’t the same.

"TEL AVIV –  An Israeli man returned a 2,000-year-old catapult bolt to the Israel Antiquities Authority some 15 years after he took off with it while visiting the archaeological site of the Jerusalem Walls National Park in the City of David, saying he wanted to clear his conscience before the end of the world. “The time has come to clear my conscience. It feels that the end of the world is near,” the remorseful man said, according to an Israel Antiquities Authority press release on Monday. The anonymous man didn’t return the artifact, also known as a ballista stone, directly but used a go-between, Moshe Manies, who agreed to keep his identity a secret.  Ballista stones from the City of David Clara Amit, Israel Antiquities Authority The original theft occurred when two rebellious youths touring City of David site close to the Old City of Jerusalem came across the ballistae, which had been catapulted at fortifications, Manies said. “One of the boys took one of the stones home. Meanwhile, he married and raised a family, and told me that for the past 15 years the stone has been weighing heavily on his heart,” Manies wrote in a Facebook post. “And now, when he came across it while cleaning for Passover, together with the apocalyptic feeling that the coronavirus has generated, he felt it was time to clear his conscience, and he asked me to help him return it to the Israel Antiquities Authority,” Manies added. Ballistae are a form of ancient weapons used in the besiege of cities. The stone would be mounted on the ballistae and catapulted onto forces standing on fortress walls, the IAA’s release said.  Courtesy: Uzi Rotstein, Israel Antiquities Authority “The ballista stones which were uncovered at the City of David are most likely connected to the harsh battles between the besieged residents of Jerusalem and the soldiers of the Roman Legion, from around 70 CE – the year of the destruction of Jerusalem,” the IAA’s Jerusalem Region Archaeologist Dr. Yuval Baruch said. “Additional stones of this type have been unearthed in Jerusalem, in, among other places, the area of the Russian Compound near the estimated path of the Third Wall, which was the external wall of Jerusalem during the time of the Second Temple. In the excavations of the Israel Antiquities Authority there, a battlefield was uncovered, with tens of ballista stones scattered on the ground,” Baruch added.

(Shalom Kveller, courtesy of the City of David Archives) A commenter on Manies Facebook post tagged Uzi Rotstein, an inspector in the IAA’s Theft Prevention Unit, who then arranged for a rendezvous for the return to take place. “Disconnecting an artifact from its archaeological framework by its removal negatively impacts the research and the ability to piece together its historical puzzle. We commend the return of the artifact and appeal to anyone who has taken an archaeological artifact, to take a weight off their heart and return it to the State Treasury,” he said. “These artifacts, which are thousands of years old, are our national treasure. They tell the story of The Land and of who resided here before us, and should be documented and displayed,” said Rotstein.  ","Fearing End of World, Thief Returns 2,000-Year-Old Artifact After 15 Years",2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/17/fearing-end-of-world-thief-returns-2000-year-old-artifact-after-15-years/,Breitbart

"TEL AVIV – An Arab-Israeli woman posing as a humanitarian worker was arrested for siphoning off aid money to the Hamas terror group, the Shin Bet security agency said Sunday. Aya Khatib, 31, funneled money and provided intelligence for the Gaza-based terror group’s military arm, the security agency said. She was apprehended last month for rerouting hundreds of thousands of shekels earmarked for needy families in Gaza, “defrauding both aid NGOs and innocent civilians who donated monies with the goal of reaching sick people and the needy,” the agency said in a statement. Some of the money went towards terror activity, including the construction of subterranean tunnels stretching into Israeli territory. In addition to raising funds, Khatib is also suspected of gathering security intelligence to promote terrorist activity against Israeli targets. “The investigation findings found that Khatib also provided intelligence to Hamas, including details on the movements of IDF forces during one of the rounds of conflict with the Gaza Strip,” the Shin Bet said. A prosecutor’s statement was filed in Acre Magistrate’s Court on Sunday and an indictment is expected to be filed at Haifa District Court in the coming days. Khatib is being charged with aiding an enemy during wartime, having contact with a foreign agent, and financial transgressions relating to terror activities. Khatib’s husband, Ali Aqel, who was arrested with her, was released the same day after a brief investigation.Dozens of Arab Israelis have protested her arrest outside the Haifa Magistrate’s Court a number of times in recent weeks.

"The U.S. airline industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak and will ask the federal government for a $50 billion aid package, according to Airlines for America (AFA), an airline advocacy organization. “U.S. carriers are in need of immediate assistance as the current economic environment is simply not sustainable,” an AFA statement said. “This is compounded by the fact that the crisis does not appear to have an end in sight.” CNN reported on the move that reverses an earlier stance the air travel industry could weather the storm — before the full impact of the virus outbreak came to light: The requested aid would be in the form of loans, grants and tax relief. The airlines are looking for up to $25 billion in grants for passenger air carriers and $4 billion in grants to cargo carriers, and the same amounts in loans or loan guarantees, Airlines for America outlined in a briefing document. The U.S. aid package has been discussed with key lawmakers and staff, as on Capitol Hill and the Trump administration, two sources said. The discussions were described as early-stage. But one source noted there is a growing recognition from the federal government that conditions “are getting very bad, very fast.” In addition the request to help the airlines, a trade group for the nation’s airports is requesting a separate $10 billion bailout, an airport industry source told CNN. The request also is in line with expected revenue drops at airports because most of the fees airlines pay are based on flight volume. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing is quoted in the CNN report that it is in discussions with the feds and the airline industry. “We’re leveraging all our resources to sustain our operations,” Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, said. “Meanwhile, ready short term access to public and private liquidity will be one of the most important ways for airlines, airports, suppliers and manufacturers to bridge to recovery, and we appreciate how the Administration and Congress are engaging with all elements of the aviation industry during this difficult time.” America’s major airlines would run out of money as soon as June 30 without financial assistance, AFA reported. President Donald Trump said at a coronavirus press conference on Monday at the White House his administration is behind helping the industry. “We’re going to back the airlines 100 percent,” Trump said. “We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much.” “We’ve told the airlines we’re going to help them,” Trump said. “It’s very important.” “There are about 460,000 jobs in the US airline industry, according to the Labor Department, and most of them provide good pay and strong benefits,” CNN reported. “The industry is crucial for the efficient functioning of the U.S. economy, not only enabling business travel but also leisure travel, which itself is a major sector of the U.S. economy. Commercial aviation taxes and fees totaled $26 billion in 2019, or an estimated $71 million per day, AFA reported. CNN reported that the last bailout for U.S. airlines was $15 billion bailout – $5 billion in cash and $10 billion in loan guarantees — following the 9/11 terror attack.

However, there were no match updates — for good reason: the game had been postponed to allow authorities to take precautions against a coronavirus outbreak.

Ahmed Hussein, the Communications manager of the Football body confirmed the development on Sunday evening. “We shall now have the tournament on March 24-28,” added Hussein. He added that they have had to push the tournament by a week because of the current challenges of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and also to give the other teams time to prepare. The Tri-Nations tournament to be played at the Ugandan National Stadium will attract hosts Uganda, Mali and Zambia. The three teams will use the tournament to prepare for the 2020 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) slated for April 4-25 in Cameroon.

Because, you know, at the beginning of this administration, when we had a lot of leaders, like, well, your father, Robert Gates, others, all said we only have one president at a time. We have to do everything we can do to make sure this president succeeds. Well, obviously, this president has made that very difficult over the past three years.

"Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) called for Congress to pass additional targeted relief to families in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak during an appearance Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” Hawley argued the best vehicle for distributing this relief would be through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), given that the agency has a method to disburse income tax reimbursements. “[T]he IRS is set up to disburse reimbursements for income taxes, for instance, so there is a mechanism there in place for the IRS,” he said. “You know, one of the advantages, I suppose, of having to pay our taxes as we do every year is that the IRS does know how to contact Americans quickly. So I think we should use the IRS disbursement process.” Hawley continued, “As to the amount, the IRS estimates that a family of four — a middle-income family of four spends about $1,800 a month on basic expenses. That’s not amenities but just basic expenses. So the idea would be to cover some increment of that to try to give working families some relief.” The Missouri Republican also argued dor the Centers for Disease Control to take more of an advisory role for the states. “I’d like to see the CDC — Centers for Disease Control — issue some uniform guidance. I don’t know that the federal government has the authority to order governors,” he added. “I mean, they can strongly encourage. You know, this is just our system of federalism, right? They can strongly encourage governors and mayors to take certain steps. But I do think it would be helpful for the Centers for Disease Control to issue uniform guidance and to say listen, here is our strong recommendation across the board.

"President Donald Trump described the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” on Twitter on Tuesday, triggering his critics. The president used the term while addressing critical comments from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. “Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,” Trump wrote. “New York is a very big ‘hotspot,’ West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.” Despite the virus originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, the president’s critics have angrily accused him of being racist for using the term “Chinese virus.” Trump also referred to the “Chinese virus” on Monday night, vowing to keep the airlines from going under as a result of dramatically reduced travel. “The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,” he wrote. “We will be stronger than ever before!” Chinese Communist Party propaganda has disparaged the term as “racist” and “reckless.” “We call on the U.S. to stop finger-pointing at China. The utmost priority is for the international community to cooperate on fighting the virus,” party spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday. “The U.S. should focus on its top priority, and play a constructive role in international cooperation on health security.” The president also shared a comment on Twitter from conservative radio host Mark Levin, criticizing The Atlantic and other American media for spewing “China’s propaganda” about the virus.

Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts. If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus. And we’re going to have a big celebration all together. The president also announced promising news in the development of a vaccine against coronavirus: With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly. A lot of progress has been made. I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history. Not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments. And we’ve had some promising results — early results, but promising — to reduce the severity and the duration of the synd- — of the symptoms. As the nation hunkers down for the next several weeks — or months — without extensive contact with one another, the prospect of a celebration may become more enticing over time. Last summer, President Trump held a celebration called “A Salute to America” on the National Mall on July 4. In it, he celebrated many of the nation’s heroes in past fights, from World War II to the civil rights struggle and beyond. Joel B.

"Ten cases of the Chinese coronavirus were confirmed Tuesday by the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) among recently arrived “refugees and asylum seekers” in Germany. Acccording to a report by the Reuters newsagency, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a press briefing about the newly diagnosed cases who had entered the country through Europe’s remaining open borders. “As of this morning, we understand there are 10 confirmed cases in Germany,” Mahecic said. “These are people who are either refugees or asylum seekers,” he added. The cases are in Munich, Berlin and Heidelberg. All national authorities have been urged by the agency to treat refugees and asylum seekers who fall sick with the virus the same way as other nationals. German police face demonstrators holding up pictures of refugees as they demonstrate against Europe’s migration policy and the handling of refugees at the Greek border on March 9, 2020 opposite the venue of a German-Hellenic Economic Forum in Berlin. ( JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images) The news of the fresh cases in Germany comes barely 24-hours after Germany closed its borders with five neighbouring countries in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus, as Breitbart News reported. At 8 am on Monday, Germany shuttered borders with Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, France and Denmark, allowing only commuters and delivery trucks to enter the country. The move reverses the policy of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had said as recently as last week the borders would remain open. Last week, Merkel also warned by the end of the outbreak in Germany, between sixty and seventy per cent of the country could become infected with the coronavirus, however, at the time refused to close down the borders.",10 Coronavirus Cases Confirmed by U.N.

"Actor George Takei has asked his 2.9 million followers on Twitter to report President Donald Trump to the platform’s authorities for “stoking racism” after the president correctly referred to the coronavirus pandemic as originating in China. Takei, who is one of Hollywood’s many anti-Trump fanatics, made the plea after Trump referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” when making a pledge to protect industries suffering the severe economic consequences of its spread. “The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!” The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.

Trump is stoking racism. @jack may not do anything, but people should let @Twitter know it’s not acceptable. https://t.co/ongaXpn4od — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) March 17, 2020  As noted by Breitbart, the terms “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus” were recently declared racist by those on the progressive left, despite the fact that journalists for CNN and even some Asian media had been using the same phrases for weeks. Over the years, many novel diseases and viruses have taken on the name of the place they originated. For example. the Ebola virus was named after a river in the Congo close to where an outbreak began, Lyme disease was after a Connecticut town experienced an outbreak in 1975, and the Zika virus was named after a forest in Uganda where scientists discovered it. Takei, however, has long sought to promote the idea that he is himself a victim of racism as an Asian American. In 2016, he even went so far as to write to the Academy Awards to complain about a joke from Chris Rock that Asian children aspired to be accountants and an insinuation by actor Sacha Baron Cohen that Asian men were not well-endowed.

"Devout Muslim Shiite followers in Iran fought their way into two major shrines closed over coronavirus fears, Iranian state media reported Tuesday, as they demanded the right to continue worshipping practices that include kissing, touching and in some cases licking sacred public objects. As the Islamic Republic pressed on with its struggle to control the Mideast’s worst Chinese coronavirus outbreak, angry crowds stormed into the courtyards of Mashhad’s Imam Reza shrine and Qom’s Fatima Masumeh shrine. The faithful typically pray there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, touching and kissing the shrine. That’s worried health officials, who for weeks ordered Iran’s Shiite clergy to shutter them. Earlier on Monday, the state TV had announced the shrines’ closure, sparking the mass protests. “We are here to say that Tehran is damn wrong to do that!” one Shiite cleric shouted at the shrine in Mashhad, according to online video. Others joined him in chanting: “The health minister is damn wrong to do that, the president is damn wrong to do that!” As Breitbart News reported, strict Muslim religious observance has clashed before with state control in Iran. Earlier this month online videos emerged showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they have no fear of infection during the country’s escalating coronavirus outbreak. <span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> Touching and kissing surfaces in shrines is a common practice for Muslim pilgrims, and religious hardliners argue the holy sites of Qom are “a place for healing” that the government has no right to close down. Iran’s shrines draw Shiites from all over the Mideast for pilgrimages, likely contributing to the spread of the virus across the region. Saudi Arabia earlier closed off Islam’s holiest sites over fear of the virus spreading. President Hassan Rouhani said despite the closures, “our soul is closer to the saints more than at any time.” Iran warned Monday the coronavirus pandemic could overwhelm local health facilities as the death toll topped 700 and another senior lawmaker died from the disease, as Breitbart News reported.

"The world must look to China, pay attention and follow its principles in order to halt the global spread of the coronavirus, the official Communist China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday. Despite the fact coronavirus was first discovered last year in the city of Wuhan, where officials tried for six weeks to conceal the deadly outbreak, China is increasingly trying to recast itself as a global leader on the treatment of the pandemic. To that end it is issuing guidance and instruction for other countries to follow, with the full support of the United Nations and World Health Organization functionaries, although not everyone is buying the propaganda push: Sen. @MarcoRubio is standing up against the communist Chinese regime.  https://t.co/RtvEKRW9CA — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 17, 2020  The China Daily editorial said Singapore, Japan and South Korea had all “based their responses on the experience and lessons drawn from China’s successful battle with the virus”, and China was now “proactively sharing” its best practices. At the same time the Communist regime is disappointed not all countries are paying attention, increasing the possibility that the epidemic will get worse, the newspaper said: Despite the unmistakable seriousness of the situation, some countries have tried to play down the risks, and the measures they have taken are not only insufficient to control the pandemic at home, but also not enough to prevent themselves from being the source of virus transmission to other countries. Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday attempts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to curb the Wuhan virus would not succeed, and could lead to retaliation. His appeal drew a sharp response from Pompeo who conveyed “strong objections” to Yang over what the State Department described as “PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” as Breitbart News reported. Over the past few weeks, Chinese officials and state-managed social media accounts began floating theories that the coronavirus began in the United States and was brought to Wuhan by U.S. Army soldiers visiting for the Military World Games in October. Thursday’s allegations from the Chinese Foreign Ministry that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in America and was spread to China by the U.S. military was not a fluke or an example of a rogue spokesman running his mouth. https://t.co/1Jt5KSCYpo — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 14, 2020  On Monday a major Chinese Communist Party paper, the Global Times, stated again – without evidence – the virus might have been developed in the U.S. Army laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, before being secretly released to harm an innocent and entirely helpless mainland Chinese populace.",China Commands World to Follow Its ‘Success’ on Wuhan Coronavirus It Hid for Months,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/17/china-commands-world-to-pay-attention-follow-its-lead-in-coronavirus-fight/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump wants an $850 billion economic package to help combat the economic effects of the coronavirus, according to reports. The package, according to reports, will ask for dramatic tax cuts and industry rescue funding for companies like the airline industry to pull them through the crisis. Congress already passed an $8 billion package of funding to help fight the virus, which Trump signed, and the House of Representatives has passed a second package of economic relief that includes funding for food and nutrition, paid sick leave, and free coronavirus testing. The Republican-led Senate has called for a much bigger economic package as the stock market collapsed by 12.93 percent on Monday.

"MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski praised President Donald Trump Tuesday for his tone during a White House press conference regarding the coronavirus pandemic. Brzezinski followed up her husband and co-host Joe Scarborough’s call to help Trump succeed by saying the President’s serious tone the day before “made it easier to parent teens” when it comes to battling the coronavirus. “[W]hat you saw yesterday was the president getting better when it came to matching his tone and his own kind of gut response to questions that he was getting to the reality of the situation,” Brzezinski told Scarborough. “And whether or not you have a jaundiced eye, you noticed that, and you sat up and took note. I mean, the President of the United States made it easier to parent teens yesterday. Because if you don’t have groups of 10 or more, and the President is saying you can’t do that, it’s much easier to communicate that to the young population. He did a lot to get people to take it seriously yesterday. I mean, I’ve seen where we are right now, and where we go during the day or communities that might be more pro-Trump, that might think this is hoaxy. Nope, everyone is in. Everyone, immediately, you could feel a difference after the news conference yesterday.” She continued, “So I don’t know if the jaundiced eye on both sides applies to right now because people are really scared. They’re seeing the signs. They’re seeing the maps. They’re seeing this spread across the world. And what they want to see from Washington is a mass mobilization, a war footing. And the President’s beginning to show that.” Brzezinski added she hopes Trump takes his Twitter behavior “down a notch.” “I’m really hoping he takes it down a notch on anything that’s sort of vintage Trump, going after people, fighting the fight,” she stated. “At this point, it is uniform what we need — uniform mobilization.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Brzezinski: Trump Coronavirus Press Conference ‘Made It Easier to Parent Teens’,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/17/brzezinski-trump-coronavirus-press-conferencemade-it-easier-to-parent-teens/,Breitbart
"Gordon Chang, Daily Beast columnist and author of The Great U.S.-China Tech War, noted the parallel narratives between America’s left-wing news media and China’s state-run propaganda regarding the coronavirus outbreak. He also praised President Donald Trump’s travel ban measures in response to the viral spread, offering his analysis on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow recalled news media derision of Trump’s identification of the coronavirus’s origin in China as “racist.” Assorted news media figures and Democrat disparaged the sharing of such information as “xenophobic.” “When did it become improper to describe a virus based off of where its origin is?” asked Marlow, reflecting on the Ebola virus being alternatively referred to as West Nile virus. “But yet, all of a sudden the president’s a racist here. It just seems like the media always does this.” “They also suggested the travel ban from Europe was racist — even though the President’s also a Nazi, depending on who you ask, and he banned travel from Germany,” joked Marlow, “but it’s hard to keep up. [Do] you take any of it seriously … or is it just all sort of their usual talking points? ” Chang replied, “I take this very seriously, because what China is trying to do [is] say that we’re responsible for the coronavirus, and that has enormous implications — not only between China the United States, but around the world — because it does affect our image.” Chang added, “China is trying to divide the U.S. by slinging these charges of racism, and so therefore they’re trying to undermine the Trump administration and the president himself.” LISTEN:
 China echoed left-wing news media in its coronavirus-related propaganda in disparaging Americans as socially pathologized by “xenophobia” and “white supremacist racism.” The one-party state also suggested the coronavirus is a biological weapon deployed by the U.S. military. Trump’s imposition of travel restrictions to limit the risk of coronavirus-infected persons entering the homeland was prudent, assessed Chang. “I’m also frustrated about something else,” said Chang, “the media, of course, is always critical. That’s just its natural bent, but we’ve got to remember that the reason why our country is not completely crippled right now is because on January 31st, President Trump, taking heat from domestic critics and from Beijing, imposed the travel bans on the quarantines in China.” Chang continued, “That actually saved us… bought us a lot of time… and also these travel bans on our allies are absolutely necessary. The one on Europe is only the most recent, but we’ve got to remember that this has stopped the flow of new infections into the United States. We’ve got trouble enough with the you know, human-to-human infections inside our country.” Chang concluded, “We don’t need people bringing more infection [or] more disease into the United States, and President Trump has taken an enormous amount of heat for that, but that’s absolutely been the right thing. I’m frustrated that we don’t see more defense of the president across media, and not just the liberal media, but this needs to be emphasized that this was really a very good thing.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

"Matt Mowers, a former Donald Trump official and New Hampshire First Congressional District Republican candidate, on Tuesday called for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to extend the tax deadline in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Mowers called for the IRS to extend the tax deadline from April 15 to July 15. Mowers also called on his opponent, Rep. Chris Pappas (D-NH), to support the tax deadline extension. The New Hampshire conservative wrote in a letter to Pappas, “During these challenging times, it is important for us all to pull together as Granite Staters and as Americans.” Mowers continued: I am writing to you because I have heard from many Granite Staters, particularly small business owners in New Hampshire, who are being hit particularly hard economically right now. They are concerned that they will not be able to make ends meet to pay their rent or their employees.” As public leaders we need to do all that we can do to make life easier for them during this period of uncertainty.

"Here is the kind of terrifying piece we’re going to see a lot more of in the coming weeks and months. It’s published today in an allegedly conservative newspaper, the Daily Telegraph and the headline is: ‘There is no alternative: we are all socialists now in the fight against coronavirus.’ Really? Says who, exactly? Oh, guess what. Turns out that the author Tom Harris is a former Labour MP. Isn’t it extraordinary how handy the coronavirus is proving towards those of a big government persuasion? Apparently — so they claim — the pandemic is just so obviously a problem that can only be solved by massive state intervention that it justifies their entire leftist belief system and forces the rest of us to do so too. Here is a taste of Harris’s drivel: But in the words of one of Mr Johnson’s predecessors, there is no alternative. Yes, he will suffer criticism for loosening the purse strings after the fashion of Gordon Brown in 2008. But Johnson has already proved himself comfortable with the reputation of being a born-again Keynesian: spending on capital projects to create jobs and boost the economy in targeted regions may be, at first glance, a Labour policy. But Johnson doesn’t care so long as the policy works. Don’t you just love the arrogance of that ‘so long as the policy works’? Harris is not even attempting to persuade us — just stating ex cathedra – that a successful outcome for a massive Keynesian spending splurge is a given, something we no longer need even to bother questioning any more. Economist Kristian Niemitz’s satirical point is well made: Coronavirus proves that we URGENTLY need to do X.X, as it happens, is one of my hobbyhorses that I've been banging on about since 1986.But that's not the point. — Kristian Niemietz shamelessly politicises stuff (@K_Niemietz) March 11, 2020  And it’s not just leftists who are coming up with this statist guff. Here’s a tweet from a former senior UKIP politician: I'm in favour of massive state (taxpayer) intervention to save the economy. It's a must. But it will be the 2nd time in 12 yrs. So I hope what emerges afterwards is a greater respect for the public realm and an end to dumb jibes about Govt always being the bane of wealth-creation — Patrick O'Flynn (@oflynnsocial) March 17, 2020  “It’s a must”. Oh well, if you say it like that, guess it must be. Here is another egregious example, this time from a notionally Conservative commentator. Nick Timothy was, of course, the chief advisor to the Theresa May government. (And remember how well that turned out…) This paragraph made me particularly nauseous. It’s essentially a riff on Barack Obama’s similarly revolting, disingenuous, overweeningly statist ‘You didn’t build that’ slogan on the 2012 campaign trail. From a leftist like Obama it was bad enough. But from someone wearing the conservative label — what was Timothy thinking when he wrote this bilge? No business has ever built its success alone. Their goods are transported by road, their workers are educated in schools, and their customers are part of sophisticated networks that include the private sector, public sector and charities. Often firms’ intellectual property originated in public institutions. Far from operating in a vacuum, all businesses rely on a strong society, with good government and moral virtues, like honesty and integrity. These siren voices urging expanded government — and more reckless spending of OUR money — are dangerous, really dangerous. Coronavirus will pass. Our economies will recover. Pump-priming them now is just insane, especially when we’re all physically incapable of going out and actually spending money. But we will as soon as we can. I agree entirely with this very sensible piece by economist Ryan Bourne: This, though, is no ordinary downturn. Economists and commentators who talk about it as such, pushing the same-old “fiscal stimulus” arguments for encouraging spending to “protect the economy,” are not just wrong right now, but dangerous. The first implication of coronavirus economics is that a sharp slowdown in activity is necessary to contain the virus, because it represents the social distancing required to reduce its spread. While usually a reasonable proxy for economic health then, GDP is temporarily useless as a metric of social welfare. We should ignore it. Second, ensuring this pause in activity does not do longer-lasting damage should be our key objective. We want this to play out like a bad agricultural season, or an extended “Christmas week” – with a Nike-tick recovery or, given some spending will never occur, a V-shaped rebound that redistributes activity over time. Both these points mean policy success should be judged not by short-run GDP, but ability to mitigate distress among vulnerable households and businesses, preventing business failures or mass layoffs in viable firms, or severe hardship for those without significant savings or employer benefits. We can judge longer success by assessing the path of GDP over 1-2 years. Again, Coronavirus will pass. But the damage done by excessive government meddling in the markets and elsewhere could last generations. This is what we should most fear; and it’s what we should fight most hard to resist.",Delingpole: Coronavirus is Going to Make Big Government Even Bigger,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/17/delingpole-coronavirus-is-going-to-make-big-government-even-bigger/,Breitbart
"Saudi Arabia reportedly charged hundreds of government officials, including military and security personnel, with crimes involving bribery and exploiting public office, the nation’s anti-corruption agency said on Sunday. The announcement was shared by Saudi Arabia’s National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nazaha). In the statement, Nazaha added investigators would bring charges against 298 people on crimes such as bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power. These crimes reportedly involve 379 million riyals ($101 million). Nazaha’s announcement provided no names and few details about the cases; Saudi Arabia does not identify individuals indicted unless they are convicted to protect their privacy. However, reports indicate that there are eight defense ministry officers accused of bribery and money laundering in relation to government contracts from 2005-2015. Also reportedly implicated are 29 interior ministry officials in the Eastern Province, including three colonels, a major general, and a brigadier general. Two judges reportedly face bribery charges as well. In addition, nine officials at AlMaarefa University in Riyadh are among the followers. Mass raids of officials, including princes and others connected to the royal family, have become a recurring event following the ascent of Cornw Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) to the position of successor to King Salman. In 2017, many of Saudi Arabia’s economic and political elite were detained in Riyadh at a luxury hotel in a crackdown on corruption; these arrests were viewed by some as an MBS effort to remove anyone posing a political threat. Last year, the royal court announced the end of this crackdown and that it would begin a new campaign to curb corruption by government employees. A new crackdown appeared to begin this month after the reported detention of two of the royal family’s most prominent members, Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, a younger brother of the king, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, nephew to the king and former crown prince. Saudi officials have not officially commented on these arrests. However, the detainment of such prominent royal family members fueled rumors of a possible coup attempt or the deterioration of 84-year-old King Salman’s health. Considered Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, MBS has reportedly sewn resentment within the royal family with his tightened grip on power, which many suggest is indicated by the necessity for such raids. A growing number of Saudi Arabia’s elites allegedly also question his leadership. In October 2019, a senior foreign diplomat, five royal sources, and business leaders disclosed to Reuters anonymously that Saudi Royal family members were increasingly frustrated over MBS’s leadership following the attack on Saudi Arabia’s Aramco oil facilities that same month. One of the sources stated, “There is a lot of resentment. How were they not able to detect the attack?”",Report: Saudi Arabia ‘Corruption’ Raid Arrests Nearly 300 More Officials,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/17/report-saudi-arabia-corruption-raid-arrests-nearly-300-more-officials/,Breitbart
"During a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated that Senate Republicans are working with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on additional coronavirus legislation and stated that he intends to keep the Senate in session “until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed, to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm.” McConnell said, “Senate Republicans are convinced that the House’s non-comprehensive bill can only be the beginning, the beginning of our efforts to support our health system, assist individual Americans and families, as well as stabilize the U.S. economy. So, last night, a group of Republican senators conferred with Secretary Mnuchin. He’s returning to the Capitol to meet with our entire conference today.

Number two, we need further strong steps to secure our economic foundation, most especially, our small businesses. In particular, it seems increasingly clear that the House’s effort to mandate that small businesses provide new worker benefits, just as many small businesses themselves are in significant jeopardy, might even be actually harmful, unless we urgently address a broader package that includes more and broader small business relief. And third, of course, the foundational priority is to continue providing all the support that our medical professionals need as they fight this new virus on the frontlines.

"Tuesday on MSNBC, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) criticized the coronavirus outbreak response of President Donald Trump’s administration. On closing restaurants and bars, Whitmer said, “In order to flatten the curve, we need to be aggressive on the front end. The federal government did not take this seriously early enough, and now it is on us to make sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science available and that we are always putting the health of our people front and center. It was a tough decision to make, but we know the spread of this virus is dependent on close proximity. This is one of many steps we’re taking in the state of Michigan.” Host Stephanie Ruhle asked, “Yesterday, The New York Times reported that the president told a group of governors, ‘Don’t wait for the federal government to get respirators and ventilators. Get them for yourself,’ What’s the reaction to that? it’s much different than the federal response during the Ebola.” Whitmer said, “This has to be all hands on deck. Cutting red tape, moving as quickly as we possibly can, and being aggressive and smart about our reaction. And so to hear the leader of the federal government tell us to work around the federal government because it’s too slow is just —it’s kind of mind-boggling, to be honest. We are pulling out all the stops in Michigan. Businesses here in Michigan that are redoubling their efforts to make sure that we’re able to access all of the kinds of equipment that we need, but we need the federal government to work. We need respirators and ventilators and personal protection equipment.

"Facebook, Google, YouTube, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter have announced that they are working together alongside government health agencies to limit the spread of “misinformation” relating to the Wuhan coronavirus. Business Insider reports that multiple Silicon Valley tech firms have announced that they’re working together to fight misinformation surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic. Facebook published a joint statement from the tech firms on its website this week. The joint statement from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube reads: We are working closely together on COVID-19 response efforts. We’re helping millions of people stay connected while also jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus, elevating authoritative content on our platforms, and sharing critical updates in coordination with government healthcare agencies around the world. We invite other companies to join us as we work to keep our communities healthy and safe. The social media firms have been under pressure recently to crack down on fake coronavirus cures, false testing methods, and other inaccurate or misleading claims that have quickly spread across social media in recent months. Facebook and Twitter have both taken steps to ban content about the Wuhan coronavirus that could cause harm, both platforms will also be highlighting information from government agencies under searches related to the outbreak. Google has announced a 24-hour coronavirus incident response team that would work to remove misinformation from search results and YouTube while promoting accurate information from health agencies. Verily, a sister company to tech giant Google, recently launched a website that allows adults in northern California to answer questions about their health and recent travel events that could result in them receiving a free coronavirus test. President Donald Trump previously thanked Google on Friday for developing a website to help the public determine if they needed to take a coronavirus test. The media accused Trump of fake news over the tool, which Google later conclusively refuted. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

In 2020, the celebrations ran from January 21 to February 20. Many U.S. tech companies in the Seattle area employ many Chinese H-1B visa-workers or sponsor Chinese to become legal immigrants, even though many Americans also apply for jobs at the companies. By January 29, companies began asking their employees not to travel to China. Online searches show why Microsoft & Amazon are concerned re #CoronaVirus: Each employs 6,000+ China-born graduates.

Surely this cannot have any impact at all on US grads' salaries. https://t.co/x96whGFVm7 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 31, 2020  On  January 31, the New England Journal of Medicine described the first Wuhan-disease carrier in the United States: On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider. … On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity. The study does not identify the patient, but does provide a unique number to his coronavirus strain: The full genome sequences from oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens were identical to one another and were nearly identical to other available 2019-nCoV sequences. There were only 3 nucleotides and 1 amino acid that differed at open reading frame 8 between this patient’s virus and the 2019-nCoV reference sequence (NC_045512.2). The sequence is available through GenBank (accession number MN985325). Bedford’s analysis also shows how travelers from Iran and Italy brought infections to cities on the East Coast. Other states have fewer recently sequenced viruses. NY has two, one with direct travel history to Iran (and which has a genome consistent with this travel history) and another that appears to be a recent travel introduction from Europe. 6/8 pic.twitter.com/YvTs58TcfC — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) March 16, 2020  The evidence or infection from abroad comes as migration advocates seek to downplay the role of migration in spreading the disease.

"Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) unveiled the Emergency Family Relief Act of 2020 on Tuesday, which would provide families economic relief in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Hawley introduced the legislation as the Senate continues to consider the House-passed Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which would require employers with fewer than 500 employees to guarantee workers paid sick and family leave. He said Americans need a simpler solution to provide them economic relief. Hawley outlined in a statement on Tuesday: Struggling families need help, and they don’t have time to sort through confusing rules and mandates about who’s paying for what and how. They’re not sure what’s going to happen to mom’s or dad’s workplace during this crisis, or if their work can afford to keep everyone on payroll. Let’s not overthink this. These families need relief — now — to pay bills that are coming due, make those emergency grocery runs, and get ready for potential medical bills. Let’s get it to them. Hawley’s legislation would: Hawley said on Fox News while the House-passed bill does provide meaningful relief to small businesses, Congress needs to do more to help families struggling through the coronavirus outbreak. He said: Well, I like the fact that it does move quickly. I like the fact that it gets relief quickly to businesses, particularly small to medium-size businesses. There’s some aspects of it that I certainly wouldn’t have drafted that way, but my view is we need to move on this quickly. I hope that if there are any amendments in the Senate that they will be processed very, very fast. But listen, we’re in the middle of a national emergency, as the president said. And my view is we need to process the House bill, which the White House negotiated, as quickly as possible and then move on because there’s a lot to do here. And families, in particular — families and working families, workers, individually, they need some support and relief. There is much work to do. We all have our part to play. But let’s be clear. We are going to BEAT THIS. Period. #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak pic.twitter.com/4BNCTo3DyE — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) March 17, 2020  Quinton Lucas —  the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri — endorsed Hawley’s legislation in a tweet on Tuesday.

Tom Cotton, who has proposed his own plan to alleviate the effects of the coronavirus epidemic, has called for Senate Republicans to pass their own coronavirus package. Aaron MacLean, Cotton’s legislative director, wrote in an email to Republican legislative directors that the Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) plan is insufficient to combat the growing threat of the coronavirus. To begin with, the House doesn’t seem to actually have a bill. Further, while the plan as we understand it has some good elements, its key plank — the paid sick leave provisions combined with ever more complicated plans from Treasury to help businesses pay for them — fails to address the severity of the moment. It introduces uncertainty and complexity at a time when Americans (including business owners) are already overwhelmed. Most important, it will not help anyone whose employer goes out of business. Its policy objectives of “wage-replacement” and “wage-continuity” for a small portion of American workers are rapidy being overcome by global events. “The Senate should think bigger,” MacLean added.

"Irish conservative student journalists carried out a months-long undercover operation that exposed multiple collaborators with Antifa in Ireland’s student government. Journalists at the Burkean, an online publication for campus conservatives in Ireland, spent months posing as Antifa on Twitter, aiming to uncover hidden sympathizers of the violent movement at Irish universities. Using the Twitter account “Irish Students Against Fascism,” they conducted and recorded several conversations with senior members of student union officials across Ireland, who made compromising comments exposing their pro-Antifa sympathies. So far, the biggest casualty of the sting is Michelle Byrne, until recently deputy president of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), a national organization representing roughly 374,000 students across the country. Byrne also serves on the board of the National Youth Council of Ireland, a mental health charity, a problem gambling charity, and also took part in an Irish parliamentary committee on housing. In conversations conducted by the Burkean’s undercover journalists, Byrne can allegedly be heard promising to hand over the names of conservative students to the fake Antifa account, which promised to pass them on to people who could “slap them around.” The Burkean’s fake Antifa account also said “Any ideas that you can’t enact for saving face – we can do the sort of illegal stuff, so to speak,” to which Bryne replied, “yeah, absolutely.” “is there anything that I can do, in my capacity in work, to help you – without obviously saying that I’m helping you?” Byrne continued. A global movement, Antifa is notorious for engaging in violent and illegal behavior. Last year, Antifa supporters in Portland violently assaulted conservative journalist Andy Ngo, putting him in the hospital with a brain hemorrhage. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned local law enforcement to be prepared for “domestic terrorist violence” from Antifa. USI launched an investigation after the publication of Byrne’s comments. She resigned from her position as deputy president shortly thereafter. Multiple other student leaders have also been implicated by the sting. Byrne’s superior, USI president Lorna Fitzpatrick, was caught on tape promising to lobby USI National Council members on a motion to support the activities of the purported Antifa group, and also agreed “in a personal capacity” with the tactic of collecting names and firing alleged “fascists” in Ireland. She also agreed to pass on the names of anyone she came across to the group. However, Fitzpatrick avoided conveying any support for Antifa in an official USI capacity. Robert Murtagh, president of the Union of Students in Northern Ireland, was also recorded expressing his support for “direct action” by the purported Antifa group, and said he was “very happy” to get involved in direct action when his term as president was over. Other Irish student leaders were also caught in the sting. Roisin Nic Lochlainn, VP of the students union at NUI Galway, expressed support for Antifa and admitted to throwing a milkshake at a conservative activist. Laura Beston, president of the students union at Trinity College Dublin, who represents over 17,000 students, was recorded expressing support for Antifa, stating that she was prepared to pass the names of conservative students to the purported Antifa group, and stating that she would encourage others to do so as well. She also promised to help Antifa gain influence with the board of Trinity College Dublin, which is widely regarded as the most prestigious university in Ireland. Jacob Woolf, a self-described socialist and acting head of Trinity College’s Jewish Society was also recorded in the sting. Woolf provided the purported Antifa group with a dossier containing names, pictures, and employment information of Burkean writers. Woolf provided the purported Antifa group with the dossier despite their stated intention to cause conservative students physical and professional harm. Woolf also declared his intention to target “classical liberals,” claiming that the label — usually associated with the moderate right — is something “fascists” call themselves to “look normal.” Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.",Undercover Sting Exposes Antifa Collaborators in Irish Student Government,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/03/17/undercover-sting-exposes-antifa-collaborators-in-irish-student-government/,Breitbart
"Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden picked a Secret Service protective detail this week, which means he is now safe-guarded with some of the very guns he is fighting to prohibit the common man from possessing. NBC News reports the Secret Service detail was assigned to Biden after his campaign filed a request for one “to senior congressional officials.” A source told Breitbart News such a detail will see Biden protected with pistols, semiautomatic rifles–perhaps ARs and/or Sig Sauer MCX platform firearms–and there is the strong possibility of fully automatic firearms being part of the equation too. The latter consist of submachine guns on a sling, which allows them to be carried out of sight under a jacket or coat. Biden enjoyed eight years of such protection as the vice president to Barack Obama. Ironically, Biden is running on a campaign to ban the common man from owning rifles such as AR-15s, AK-47s, Sig Sauer MCXs, and similar firearms. He is also campaigning to ban the common man from having “20, 30, 40, 50 clips in a weapon.” The Secret Service agents protecting Biden will certainly be using 30-round magazines in their ARs. Thirty rounds are standard capacity for such a firearm. Mike Bloomberg also availed himself of armed guards while he was running to secure the Democrat nomination and prohibited a large category of guns to the common man.

"Ohio postponed its March 17 primary at the last minute over mounting coronavirus concerns, Gov. Mike DeWine (R) affirmed Monday night. DeWine announced on Monday that he was moving to postpone Tuesday’s election to June 2 out of an abundance of caution but admitted that he alone did not possess the authority to move the date. A Franklin County judge ultimately denied DeWine’s lawsuit, which moved its way up to the state’s Supreme Court. “Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls,” Politico reported. Ultimately, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton signed an order to close the polls, citing a health emergency. DeWine said in a statement: During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus. As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency.

"President Donald Trump struck a realistic but optimistic tone about the fight against the coronavirus outbreak on Tuesday as he addressed reporters  in the White House Briefing Room. “One day we’ll be standing, possibly, up here, and we’ll say, ‘Well, we won’,” the president said. “And we’re going to say that. Sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that. And we’re going to win. I think we’re going to win faster than people think, I hope.” The president and his team described extraordinary measures being taken to contain the virus — as well as progress being made on testing and on preparing hospitals with the machines and space necessary to take care of an expected influx of patients who had been infected. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said that plans were being discussed to provide checks directly to Americans in the next two weeks, rather than waiting for a payroll tax cut to kick in over a longer period. New innovations were described in tele-medicine, and public-private partnerships in the food sector — such as special shopping hours for seniors only. The president described improved cooperation with the states, and deferred to governors’ decisions on questions such as whether to postpone state primary elections. “We’re ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and growing economy, because that’s what’s going to happen,” Trump said. “It’s going to pop.” Joel B.

He added that wealthy Americans would not get direct payments as they did not need it. “I think it’s clear, we don’t need to send people who make millions of dollars a year checks, OK?” Mnuchin said to reporters. Trump agreed. “Obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks for $1,000. Mnuchin said that some of the reported funding numbers of $850 billion for a rescue were probably more expensive than the final bill would be, but that details would be released later in the day. “This is stuff that needs to be done now, the president has instructed to me that this is no fault to American workers,” he said. Trump said there were four different ways to get funding directly to Americans, and said that although he supported a payroll tax cut, he was looking at a better way to get funding to Americans faster. “We want to do something much faster than that,” Trump said. There has been growing support among Republican Senators for direct payments to the American people as proposed by Breitbart economic editor John Carney on Saturday. “You can think of this as something like business interruption payments for the American workers,” Mnuchin said.
Mnuchin left the press conference early to meet with members of Congress on Capitol Hill for a big economic rescue package to help businesses and workers. Trump said that there was support from Congress to do something dramatic. “It’s going to be big, it’s going to be bold,” Trump said. “And the level of enthusiasm to get something done, I don’t think I’ve seen anything quite like it.”",‘Americans Need Cash Now’ — Donald Trump Wants to Send Checks to Households Immediately,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/americans-need-cash-now-donald-trump-wants-to-send-checks-to-households-immediately/,Breitbart
"The chancellor of the Exchequer has announced at least £330 billion in government-assured loans to keep businesses afloat and employees paid as well as three-month mortgage holidays for borrowers in need. Rishi Sunak revealed the next government financial intervention for coronavirus at a press conference alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson and chief medical adviser Sir Patrick Vallance from Downing Street on Tuesday. “I will strengthen our support for people,” Mr Sunak said, outlining: “Following discussion with the industry today, I can announce that those in difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will now offer a three-month mortgage holiday so people will not have to pay a penny in mortgage costs while they get back on their feet.” Mr Sunak also unveiled support for businesses, saying: “Today I am making available an additional £330 billion of guarantees — equivalent to 15 per cent of our GDP. “That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, salaries, suppliers, or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms,” adding that the government will make more loan available “as much is required”.

Both schemes will be up and running next week, and his team is discussing special assistance for airlines in the wake of a number of them slashing routes by up to 80 per cent. The chancellor of the Exchequer also confirmed that pubs, clubs, and other social venues suffering a drop in business will be able to access insurance claims against their policy. He also extended the business rates holiday to all businesses in the hospitality or retail sector for 12 months. The support comes after Prime Minister Johnson urged Britons to enact social distancing, telling them to “avoid pubs, clubs, theatres, and other such social venues” and to work at home where possible. “We have never faced an economic fight like this one, but we are well-prepared. We will get through this, and we will do whatever it takes,” the chancellor concluded.

"A Univision poll of the crucially important swing state Florida shows President Trump beating both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Against Grandpa Joe Biden, Trump leads 48 to 45 percent. This is in line with a Florida Atlantic poll taken a few days earlier that has Trump up 51 to 49 percent over Biden. Against Bernie Sanders, Trump wins the Sunshine State 49 to 42 percent. That Florida Atlantic poll shows Trump up over Bernie 53 to 47 percent. One advantage Democrats were looking for in Florida was Andrew Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor who ran for governor (and lost) in 2018. Gillum, a young, charismatic black man, was almost certainly at the top of any list for vice presidential nominees. Those hopes came to a screeching halt last week, though, when police found Gillum inebriated at 1 a.m. in a hotel room with another man who had overdosed. The second man works as a gay escort. What’s more, meth was found in the room. Gillum is married with three children. Other swing state polling is not as rosy for Trump. In Ohio, an NBC/Marist poll (which is not a very reliable poll), shows Trump losing to Biden 49 to 45 percent and losing to Bernie 48 to 46 percent. In 2016, Trump won Ohio by eight points. In Arizona, Marist shows Trump losing to Biden by one point, 47 to 46 percent; Trump is beating Bernie 48 to 45 percent. In 2016, Trump won Arizona by 3.5 points. With the economy effectively shut down and the president in war mode, the entire game board is scrambled. We have no idea what our country, our economy, or the world is going to look like next week, much less in eight months. That’s the long way of saying these polls don’t mean much right now. We also don’t know how well Trump is going to handle this unprecedented situation. My guess is that people will judge him based on the final numbers, the death toll, as grisly as that sounds. Anyone who tells you they can foresee what anything will look like in November, much less the presidential election, is delusional.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"A Google search for the term “Democratic Party” returned a logo of a rat replacing the party’s traditional donkey mascot. The manipulation occured in Google’s Knowledge Panel, which the tech giant displays prominently for many searches. Mashable reports that Google’s “Knowledge Panel” information box has once again been manipulated, this time if users search for the term “Democratic Party” they are told that the official symbol of the political party is a red, white, and blue drawing of a rat. This isn’t the first time that Google’s Knowledge Panel has been manipulated to display incorrect results.  Mashable reached out to Google to request a comment on the manipulation, to which a spokesperson stated that if the Democratic Party had taken the time to claim its Knowledge Panel then it couldn’t have been so easily changed. “Most images in Knowledge Panels are automatically generated from pages on the web,” wrote the spokesperson over email. “When errors are reported, we fix them quickly. We encourage people and organizations to claim their Knowledge Panels, which allows them to select a representative image.” This is far from the first time that a political party’s Knowledge Panel has been defaced, Breitbart News reported in June of 2018 that Google displayed an image labeled “BIGOT” next to searches for North Carolina State Senator Trudy Wade. Breitbart News reporter Allum Bokhari wrote at the time: “If you search “Trudy Wade” on Google, the search giant displays an old photo in the “knowledge panel” of its search results with “BIGOT” superimposed in big red letters” reported Vice. The image is now removed. Google apologized to Sen. Wade in a statement on social media. We apologize to Senator Wade that this image appeared in the Knowledge Panel in Search. Images that appear in the Knowledge Panel are either selected by verified users or are automatically sourced from sites across the web. — Google Communications (@Google_Comms) June 2, 2018  Shortly before that in May 2018, it was reported that “Nazism” was listed as the Republican party’s official political ideology. Breitbart News wrote at the time: Until earlier today, a Google search for the California Republican Party brought up a list of ideologies in the “knowledge panel” that sometimes appears on the right-hand side of search results. These ideologies included “Nazism, Conservatism, Market liberalism, fiscal conservatism, green conservatism.” The story was first reported by Vice. After press coverage and attention from House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the “ideology” infobox section has now disappeared. Searches for other California parties, like the California Green Party, still show an “ideology” infobox. Other state GOP parties also display the infobox. The information for these boxes appears to have been sourced from Wikipedia. The edit history of the California Republican party shows that someone edited the party’s Wikipedia page to include “Nazism” among its ideologies. Responding to Rep. McCarthy, Google confirmed that “Wikipedia vandalism” was the cause of the problem. As Breitbart News has documented before, Wikipedia pages are oftenbiased smear-jobs, the result of partisan editing by anonymous, unaccountable contributors to the site. Nevertheless, big tech companies continue to give information from Wikipedia a privileged position on their platforms — not just next to Google searches but also YouTube videos and Facebook posts.

"President Donald Trump defended Tuesday his practice of referring to the coronavirus as a “Chinese Virus” despite criticism that the term was racist. “I have to call it where it came from, it did come from China, so I think it’s a very accurate term,” he said. Trump said he used the term to remind the world of the origin of the virus after China suggested that it originated from the United States military. “Well China was putting out information which was false, that our military gave this to them, that was false,” Trump said. When asked if he thought the term unfairly created a “stigma,” Trump replied, “No I don’t think so. I think that saying our military gave it to them creates a stigma.” On Monday and Tuesday Trump twice used the phrase to refer to the coronavirus. “The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,” he wrote on Twitter on Monday. “We will be stronger than ever before!”",Donald Trump Defends Calling Coronavirus ‘Chinese Virus’,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/donald-trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-chinese-virus/,Breitbart
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced at the daily White House coronavirus briefing on Tuesday that the April 15 deadline for Americans to file their income taxes will now allow individuals who owe money to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to defer payment up to one million dollars with no interest or penalty fee for 90 days. “We previously talked about deferring IRS payments,” Mnuchin said. “The president earlier this morning authorized me to announce this program.” “I announced we would defer to one hundred billion dollars and the president suggested we increase that to $300 billion,” Mnuchin said. Mnuchin, at the same time, encouraged people to file their taxes by the usual deadline if they can. “We encourage the American who can file their taxes [by April 15] to continue to file their taxes because you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out,” Mnuchin said. “Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and the IRS,” Mnuchin said. “If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to a million dollars as an individual and the reason we are doing a million dollars is because that covers pass-throughs and businesses, and $10 million for corporations, interest free and penalty free for 90 days.” “All you have to do is file your taxes,” Mnuchin said. “Any American has the right to extend their taxes.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter","Treasury Secretary Announces Tax Day Relief; Individual Payments Can Be Deferred up to $1M, Refunds to Continue",2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/treasury-secretary-announces-tax-day-relief-individual-payments-deferred-1m-refunds-continue/,Breitbart
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday at the White House that the Trump administration wanted to keep the stock markets open during the coronavirus crisis but that it was open to the concept of shortening trading hours. “We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,” he said. “Americans need to know that they have access to their money.” Mnuchin said that he had spoken with the New York Stock Exchange and major banks about the stock markets. “Everybody wants to keep it open,” he said. “We may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that’s something they need to do.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped over 400 points after Mnuchin commented on the markets and detailed an economic rescue package for industries affected by the virus.

"Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) said on Monday that the United States should begin forcing China to “pay the burden and the cost incurred” by the U.S. due to the Wuhan coronavirus. The Indiana lawmaker said during an appearance on Monday’s Tucker Carlson Tonight that the U.S. should place the financial burden caused by the Chinese coronavirus on China and floated several ways to do that, including China relieving a “great amount” of U.S. debt. “We need to start by forcing China to pay the burden and the cost incurred on the United States of America due to the coronavirus. I think there are many ways that we can do that,” Banks said. He continued: The president could force China to relieve a great amount of American debt. He could institute tariffs on China and designate the funds from that into a coronavirus victim relief fund to pay the cost incurred on Americans and American taxpayers due to the negligence on China’s behalf that’s led to the crisis in America today. “So by releasing the debt, the U.S. debt held by the Chinese, we could fund that,” Carlson said, asking Banks if he believes the Trump administration will go in that direction. “I hope so,” Banks said, applauding the “enormous” strength Trump demonstrated on trade deals. “I have no doubt that President Trump will do everything that he can to hold China accountable for what they’ve caused on Americans today,” he said. “I joined @tuckercarlson last night to discuss how we can begin to demand reparations from Communist #China for putting us through the economic strain of #coronavirus,” Banks said in a tweet that shared his Tucker Carlson Tonight segment: I joined @tuckercarlson last night to discuss how we can begin to demand reparations from Communist #China for putting us through the economic strain of #coronavirus.

"The nation could face a severe hospital bed shortage if it reaches the worst-case scenario with the coronavirus outbreak in the United States — potentially 4.7 million patients, or 5.7 for every domestic hospital bed, according to a USA Today study. There is, however, one solution to create more hospital beds in a rush: Task the military. President Trump said Tuesday during a White House press conference that the Pentagon can deploy field hospitals and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can retrofit existing sites into hospital centers to alleviate the hospital bed shortage. The Pentagon said Monday it stands ready to assist in the nation’s response to coronavirus, if requested. The Trump administration — either through Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) — can request the Pentagon to help provide facilities that could be used as temporary hospitals — if not for those suffering from coronavirus, then for those with less critical ailments in order to free up hospital beds There are a number of ways the Pentagon can help. It can provide some hospital beds at its 36 hospitals across the nation. Officials warn, however, that most of them are small community hospitals with fewer than 1,000 beds that are not suited for infectious disease cases. However, patients with less urgent illnesses or ailments can be directed to military hospitals, freeing up beds at civilian hospitals for coronavirus patients. The Pentagon also has two hospital ships, with about 1,000 beds each. Those would only help states near the water, and similar to military hospitals, are not specifically suited for infectious diseases cases but can take patients to lessen the burden on civilian hospitals. The Pentagon could, as the president noted, deploy tent hospitals of varying sizes and capabilities depending on the mission. Defense officials say they are looking at how fast those tent hospitals can be provided. They warn, however, that they will need medical personnel to staff those tent hospitals and calling National Guard or Reserve medical personnel to duty may shortchange their medical civilian jobs and communities. “The president has us inventorying what you all understand as field hospitals, or MASH hospitals, that can be deployed very quickly,” said Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday during the White House press conference. “The field hospitals go up very quickly. We have them. We have all of this equipment in stock, and we’re looking at different sites in different locations,” Trump added. The Pentagon can also direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to work on rapidly modifying existing sites into overflow hospital centers — again, if not for coronavirus patients, then patients with less urgent needs in order to free up beds for coronavirus patients. Since the Army Corps of Engineers does not actually build anything, but issues contracts to private companies to then work on projects, it would need to start right away. “The Army Corps is very prepared to do as we say,” Trump said. “The Army Corps of Engineers is ready, willing, and able. We have to give them the go-ahead if we find that is necessary, and we can get quite a few units up very rapidly.” The National Guard can provide armories for overflow hospital centers, expertise on logistics, and hospital and facilities management. “Whatever the governor’s office asks for to pick our brains, we’ll scour amongst our force,” New York National Guard spokesman Col. Richard Goldenberg told Breitbart News. “The National Guard is a reflection of different aspects, so it’s not just military skill sets and experience, but we may have members with civilian skill sets and experiences, either in hospital management, facilities management, or other types of skill sets they may need,” he added. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has called for the military to help turn existing facilities, such as military bases and college dormitories — many of which are vacated due to the coronavirus — into temporary medical centers. Eric Adams, president of the Brooklyn Burroughs, said his office has identified a range of publicly-owned options in Brooklyn and is investigating privately-owned sites as well. He suggested in a letter to Cuomo a decommissioned detention site, schools, and sports facilities. In response to @NYGovCuomo's and @NYCMayor's call for #COVID19 hospital overflow sites, my office has ID'ed a range of publicly-owned options in Brooklyn, and are still investigating privately-owned sites as well.

Other governors can request the same help from the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard, but the Trump administration can direct the Pentagon and the National Guard to start looking at these measures for every state now so they are ready if and when governors ask.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",How President Trump Can Alleviate the Hospital Bed Shortage Issue Now,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/how-president-trump-can-alleviate-the-hospital-bed-shortage-issue-now/,Breitbart
"Former Democratic Party presidential candidate Andrew Yang has reached out to the White House to help President Donald Trump as the administration considers a version of Yang’s signature idea: $1,000 checks to all households. At a White House briefing on Tuesday, President Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin revealed that the administration wants to send checks to Americans “immediately,” rather than providing a payroll tax cut on its own. The emergency measure would provide cash to households facing an immediate cash crunch due to the loss of work or business with the sudden spread of the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in a sudden halt to the economy. Breitbart News’ John Carney made a similar proposal earlier this month, as has Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) recently. Yang’s proposal was to provide a Universal Basic Income (UBI) of $1,000 per month to every American citizen as a buffer against the effects of automation, which could eliminate American jobs.

"Maryland is postponing its previously scheduled April 28 primary election to June 2 over the growing Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Larry Hogan announced on Tuesday. “I have two main priorities — keeping Marylanders safe and protecting their constitutional right to vote,” Hogan said at a news conference. The state elections board will have until April 3 to “propose a voting plan that will protect the public,” according to the Baltimore Sun. While elections will be postponed on a statewide level, the special election for the seat of late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) will proceed via a vote-by-mail system for that district, specifically. Hogan said that the option could not be implemented in a timely manner for the entire state ahead of the April 28 election but added that it is imperative that constituents in the 7th Congressional District “have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress.” “Free and fair elections are the very foundation of American democracy and while there are many valid reasons for unease and uncertainty right now, ensuring that the voices of Maryland citizens are heard shouldn’t be one of them,” Hogan said. Maryland is just the latest in a growing list of states postponing their elections due to coronavirus-related concerns. Those states now include Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky, and Ohio. Hogan has taken drastic action in an attempt to curb the coronavirus pandemic, announcing the closure of restaurants, bars, fitness centers, theaters, and spas across the state. He has also ordered a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more. “Planned large gatherings and events must be canceled or postponed until after termination of the state of emergency and the proclamation of the catastrophic health emergency has been rescinded,” Maryland’s government website reads: Today I announced additional unprecedented actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Maryland.

"California attorney and Republican Party official Harmeet Dhillon blasted her hometown of San Francisco over its response to the coronavirus outbreak in a series of tweets on Tuesday. “As a San Francisco resident and business owner, I’m wondering—can I trust the health judgments of leaders who let thousands live on the streets in their filth?” Dhillon wrote. “And if we are now getting homeless into shelter, why couldn’t that have happened earlier? Doesn’t their health count?” Dhillon has been a vocal critic of the city allowing homeless to live on the streets of San Francisco neighborhoods, particularly Tenderloin. The area has been plagued by thousands of reports of feces and used needles littering sidewalks. “All of a sudden we are supposed to accept 24-hour curfews ‘for your own safety’ from people who order the police to stand down when Antifa & friends beat the hell out of taxpayers; people who refuse to enforce laws they don’t like (death penalty, bail, property crimes)?” she continued. “City leaders who literally give wanted alien criminals a public heads up when ICE is about to conduct raids are now telling me what’s best, declaring a death penalty for businesses, no hearings or due process?!

Dhillon argued the recommendations for senior citizens to stay inside “seemed reasonable,” but, “Liberal city leaders decided to seize the opportunity and throw the whole economy into a tailspin as collateral damage but don’t worry — we’ll soon have a government sponsored bailout for favored groups soon, funded with a tax increase crammed down the throats of the dwindling number of taxpayers.” The attorney then set her sights on local leaders, who have a less-than-stellar track record. “SF Mayor London is tied to a corruption investigation of a federally indicted city bureaucrat she dated.

"Left-wing challenger Marie Newman defeated incumbent Democrat Rep. Dan Lipinski in the primary for Illinois’ third congressional district on Tuesday. Newman, who fell short of unseating Lipinski in 2018, was backed by pro-choice and “progressive” forces eager to take down the moderate Lipinski, who compiled a pro-life, pro-Israel, and pro-market record over the last fifteen years representing the southwest side of Chicago and nearby suburbs. In 2010, Lipinski was one of several dozen Democrats to oppose Obamacare, doing so against tremendous pressure from the leadership of his party. The Associated Press called the race late Tuesday evening: AP calls #IL03 Democratic primary race for Marie Newman defeating 8-term Rep. Dan Lipinski in election rematch.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez https://t.co/JUAufoWMef — The New York Times (@nytimes) March 18, 2020  After Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Lipinski’s opponent last year, he had responded: “Ms. Newman is an extreme candidate who is completely out of step with the voters of Illinois’ Third District who do not want to be represented by a fifth member of the ‘Squad.'” Evidently, however, they do — at least those motivated enough to vote. The “Squad” refers to a group of left-wing first-term legislators loosely led by Ocasio-Cortez. The election took place against the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak, with city officials complaining that Gov. J. B. Pritzker should not have allowed the the primary to be held at all. Many election judges and poll workers refused to show up on Tuesday, and several polling stations were relocated. Newman will face Republican Mike Fricilone in November. Joel B.

But Sean, they were using the old, manual testing methods in labs, which could only test about 40 to 60 people a week. Because President Trump, two weeks ago, brought together the top commercial labs in the country, and because the FDA moved in record time, now, we have what are called high throughput tests, automated tests that can literally test thousands of people a day for the coronavirus. … U.S. Public Health Service and FEMA are working with states around the country to build on the states’ efforts to establish drive-thru and community coronavirus testing centers. Those are coming online, starting tomorrow, and they’ll be widening their scope around the country.” He added that “now that we have the commercial labs around the country with those high-speed, automated tests, you’re literally going to see tens of thousands of tests in the days and weeks ahead for the American people.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",Pence: You’ll See ‘Tens of Thousands of Tests’ in Next Days and Weeks,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/17/pence-youll-see-tens-of-thousands-of-tests-in-next-days-and-weeks/,Breitbart

"Former Vice President Joe Biden used his speech after Democrat primary wins in Florida and Illinois to try to appear presidential during the coronavirus crisis and appeal to rival Bernie Sanders voters. After first mispronouncing and repeating “Good Evening,” Biden delivered a live-streamed speech from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, first speaking about the coronavirus epidemic. He spoke calmly and slowly, appearing to be reading from a teleprompter or script, and compared fighting the coronavirus to “fighting a war” that is “going to require leadership.” “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead,” he said. He did not reference Trump during his speech, although he and his surrogates have attacked the Trump administration’s response over the last week. “That’s who we are…ordinary people doing extraordinary things,” he said, before turning to the Democrat primaries on Tuesday in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona. Noting that results were not in yet in Arizona, he said, “Today, it looks like once again, in Florida and Illinois…our campaign has had a good night.” He said the campaign has built a “broad coalition” of African Americans, Latinos, high-school educated workers, and teachers. Sanders was expected to lose in Florida, in part due to his praise for former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and the large anti-Communist Cuban-American population in Florida. Biden then thanked Sanders and tried to appeal to his voters. “Sen. Sanders and I share a common vision,” he said, citing affordable health care, income inequality, and climate change. “Let me say, especially to the young voters inspired by Sen. Sanders, ‘I hear you,'” he said. “My goal is to unify this party, and then to unify the nation.” He then turned back to say the coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican, He said. “This is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in all of us.” At the end of his speech, Biden stood still and looked into the camera in silence as his wife, Jill Biden, walked up beside him, surprising him. “Oh!” he exclaimed when she went to give him a hug. He then said “thank you,” several times, followed by, “OK,” before walking off. His campaign has been beset by both verbal gaffes and technical live-streaming difficulties, all of which were kept to a minimum in the seemingly carefully choreographed event.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.","Joe Biden Delivers Speech on Coronavirus After Primary Wins in Florida, Illinois",2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/joe-biden-delivers-speech-on-coronavirus-after-primary-wins-in-florida-illinois/,Breitbart
"Tuesday on MSNBC, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) criticized President Donald Trump for tweeting that she was a “failing Michigan governor.” In that tweet, Trump said Whitmer “must work harder and be much more proactive.” Whitmer said, “We’ve been working overtime to try to be as aggressive as we can to flatten the curve on the coronavirus spread. We knew it was going to come to Michigan at some point, and that’s why I ginned up the state emergency operations center back at the end of February. While it hadn’t been here yet, we knew it was coming. We started task forces and declared a state of emergency immediately. I know how important it is that we are aggressive, where there’s been a vacuum of leadership. I think it’s important all of these governors and mayors across the country are taking the bold action we need to protect the public.” She continued, “We don’t have enough tests, and we don’t have enough resources to make sure that we’re able to process the tests as quickly as we need to. And because of that, we are not confident that we have a real handle on how many people are actually carrying the coronavirus in Michigan and where they are and how we can track down the genesis. And that is dangerous. And that’s why these aggressive actions that we’ve taken like states like Ohio, my friend Mike DeWine, Republican, we’ve been on the phone talking to one another to make sure we are using best practices, making decisions based on the best findings and facts, and always centered around what is in the best interest of the public health. And I’m grateful I’ve got fellow governors who wished to talk and strategize because it is so important that we are aggressive on this front end. But we need help out of the federal government.” Rachel Maddow asked, “The president took some shots at you and has been attacking you personally even as each of you is trying to weather the state and the federal divide in terms of coming up with a response to this. Do you feel like you are able to have a constructive working relationship with the federal government? Does the president attacking you affect how well Michigan is able to respond to what’s happening in your state?” Whitmer responded, “You know what, I can’t get distracted by that. It’s ironic that my point I was making as I was being attacked was that they’re not serious. They’re watching TV and attacking via Twitter. That’s not going to help anything. The only thing that helps us manage a crisis is having clear and swift information, having personal protection equipment, ensuring we’ve got the tests that we need, and the resource that is necessary.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Tuesday called for the United States government to give paychecks to American households in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic — a general proposal thoroughly championed by the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force. Sanders addressed the nation, outlining the steps he believes the U.S. government needs to take in its continued response to the global pandemic. The presidential hopeful floated $2,000 monthly payments to American households — a concept President Trump publicly backed during Tuesday’s press briefing at the White House alongside his administration’s coronavirus task force. “Further, we need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in America every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families,” Sanders said:  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin detailed the administration’s pitch to deliver direct payments to American workers in the midst of the ongoing crisis. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said: “Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now,” he continued, adding that it’s “clear” the administration does not need to “send people who make millions of dollars a year checks.” “I think we’re going to do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible. That may not be an accurate way of doing it, because obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks for $1000,” Trump remarked. “But we’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day what we’re going to be doing,” the president added. Sanders also called for emergency unemployment assistance, offering 100 percent of an individual’s prior salary with a cap of $75,000 per year. Altogether, Sanders estimated that the response for this “unprecedented moment” will cost roughly $2 trillion.",Bernie Sanders Follows President Trump Calling for Cash Payments to Americans,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/bernie-sanders-follows-president-trump-calling-for-cash-payments-to-americans/,Breitbart
"For the first time since the week ending February 29, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released its Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report, which shows that the death toll from the seasonal flu has reached 22,000, including 144 children. The CDC website notes the tardiness of the report.  “The COVID-19 outbreak unfolding in the United States may affect healthcare seeking behavior which in turn would impact data from ILINet (Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network),” the website stated. The website provided updated information: Flu activity as reported by clinical laboratories remains high but decreased for the fourth week in a row; however, influenza-like illness activity increased slightly.  Severity indicators remain moderate to low overall, but hospitalization rates differ by age group, with high rates among children and young adults. Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)psm09 viruses are now the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season. Previously, influenza B/Victoria viruses predominated nationally. But this flu season has broken at least one record. Laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalization rates for the overall U.S. population remain moderate compared to recent seasons, but rates for children 0-4 years and adults 18-49 years are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups, surpassing rates reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Hospitalization rates for school-aged children (5-17 years) are higher than any recent regular season but remain lower than rates experienced by this age group during the pandemic. The report also noted at least 36 million flu illnesses in the United States and 370,000 hospitalizations.

"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) in a  Tuesday press conference praised President Trump’s response efforts to the coronavirus pandemic in New York, saying his team was “on it” and that he was doing the “right thing.” He also called for Americans to put politics aside. Cuomo, whose state is facing more than 600 cases, said he spoke to Trump in the morning about using federal resources to combat coronavirus in New York. “He is ready, willing, and able to help. I’ve been speaking with members of his staff late last night, early this morning. We need their help, especially on the hospital capacity issue,” he said. “We need FEMA, FEMA has tremendous resources. When I was at HUD, we worked with FEMA. I know what they can do. I know what the Army Corps of Engineers can do. They have a capacity that we simply do not have,” he said. He said he has known Trump for many years and extended his hand in partnership. He said: I said to the president, who is a New Yorker, who I’ve known for many, many years, I put my hand out in partnership. ‘I want to work together, 100 percent. I need your help. I want your help. And New Yorkers will do everything they can to be good partners with the federal government. He said he believed Trump was “100 percent sincere in saying that he wanted to work together, in partnership, in a spirit of cooperation,” and that his actions “evidence that.” Cuomo complimented the administration’s response: His team has been on it. I know a team when they’re on it, and I know a team when they’re not on it. His team is on it, they’ve been responsive, late at night, early in the morning, and they’ve thus far been doing everything that they can do, and I want to say thank you, and I want to say that I appreciate it. They will have nothing but cooperation and partnership from the state of New York. Cuomo’s response stands in stark contrast to many Democrats, who are attacking the president and the administration over the coronavirus. The Washington Post reported Tuesday a Democrat super PAC plans to spend $5 million on digital advertising criticizing Trump for his response to the coronavirus — just “one of several groups that planned to devote resources to this type of messaging.” As Breitbart News reported, both Democrat presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have attacked Trump for his response to the coronavirus crisis, which began in China. As Joel Pollak reported: Biden — who called Trump’s January travel ban on China “hysterical” and “racist” — criticized the president and released his own plan, while opposing travel bans from China, Europe, “or any other part of the world.” Sanders called for Trump to be replaced on the coronavirus issue by “experts” and Congress — and said he should be “shut up.” Cuomo appealed for unity and said now is not a time for politics. “We are not Democrats, we are not Republicans, we are Americans at the end of the day. That’s who we are. And that’s who we are when we’re at our best,” he said. “So this hyper-sensitivity about politics and reading every comment and wanting to pit one against the other, there’s no time for this. The president is doing the right thing in offering to step up with New York and I appreciate it. And New York will do the right thing in return.”   Follow Breitbart News’ Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",NY Governor Cuomo Praises Trump: ‘His Team Has Been on It’ ‘President Is Doing the Right Thing’,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/ny-governor-cuomo-praises-trump-his-team-has-been-on-it-president-is-doing-the-right-thing/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump has ordered border agencies to quickly return all migrants from Mexican territory, regardless of routine asylum laws, according to the New York Times. The New York Times, citing information from four administration officials, said: The Trump administration plans to immediately turn back all asylum seekers and other foreigners attempting to enter the United States from Mexico illegally, saying the nation cannot risk allowing the coronavirus to spread through detention facilities and border patrol agents. But under the new rule, set to be announced in the next 48 hours, border patrol agents would immediately return anyone to Mexico — without any detainment and without any due process — who attempts to cross the southwestern border between the legal ports of entry. They would not be held for any length of time in an American facility. The decision reduces the danger that the coronavirus will be brought into ICE detention centers by additional migrants. The short report does not explain the legal rationale for the decision, which puts a final closure on the much-diminished 2019 inflow from Central America. But Section 212(f) of the 1965 immigration act says: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. Business groups strongly dislike this 212(f) rule, which can raise Americans’ wages by choking off the flow of blue-collar migrants into Americans’ workplaces during a growing economy. The southern border will stay open for Americans, foreigners with proper documents, and for trade, the New York Times continued: The administration officials said the ports of entry would remain open to American citizens, green-card holders and foreigners with proper documentation. Some foreigners would be blocked, including Europeans currently subject to earlier travel restrictions imposed by the administration. The points of entry will also be open to commercial traffic. The New York Times‘ report was also silent about the northern border, which is open to many of the travelers from China who have been welcomed by the Canadian government during the last several weeks. The report did not say if the government will curb the inflow of white-collar migrants — such as H-1B workers — to high-tech companies. The inflow likely helped spread the coronavirus through Washington state One traveler from China directly about 30 people with coronavirus in the Seattle area during January and Feb. No report yet on far those infections have spread onwards. This may be one unforeseen cost of the tech sector's preference for visa-workers.  https://t.co/MRVZ1HLGT6 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 17, 2020  The decision was quickly opposed by immigration lawyers. A tweet from Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, an advocate at the American Immigration Council, said: Extremely concerned with this reported plan, which supposedly involves deliberately turning away asylum seekers ‘without any due process,’ including those who seek asylum at ports of entry. I am unsure whether any such legal authority exists. In recent days, pro-migration groups have been urging the border agencies to open the border to the 30,000 migrants who are waiting in Mexico for their asylum hearings. The migrants were sent back to Mexico by the successful “Remain in Mexico” policy. The policy is formally titled the ‘Migrant Protection Protocols.’ For example, the pro-migration pressure group FWD.us tweeted this call for opening the borders to the MPP migrants: 2 things you can do: 1. Tell Congress to #ParoleThemAll & let all asylum seekers in the MPP program in before they get the virus.  2.

"The U.S. association of pork suppliers is asking for more foreign visa workers despite the huge loss of American jobs during the coronavirus epidemic. The federation’s March 10 letter to Congress said: The U.S. pork industry, which is suffering from a severe labor shortage on farms and in plants, is headed for a serious market disruption with catastrophic implications for hog farmers. According to industry economists and analysts, there are not enough available workers to run weekday second shifts or Saturday shifts in many of the nation’s pork packing plants. Hog farmers are also struggling to find a sustained supply of workers as unemployment rates have fallen dramatically. The demand was denounced by the union, which represents 30,000 workers at the pork slaughterhouses, according to Bloomberg News: Allowing for additional migrant workers will “destroy American jobs and further weaken the economy,” [United Food & Commercial Workers Union] International President Marc Perrone said in a statement. “The last thing Americans need is giant corporations watering down safeguards that protect American workers and our country’s food safety,” he said. The pork producers pushed back, Bloomberg reported March 13: “Our farms and plants tell us they are paying over-prevailing wages and still can’t find people,” said Nick Giordano, a vice president at the pork producer council. “If UFCW can supply us with employees, that would be great, because our farms and plants are hiring now.” Wages for slaughterhouse workers have dropped since the early 1980s, and companies invest little in automating the grueling and gruesome work because the companies have enjoyed a flood of migrant — and often illegal — labor. But President Donald Trump is forcing wages up by constricting the supply of new refugees and southern migrants. Before the 1980s, the industry’s wages were higher than manufacturing wages, but the industry broke the union and moved the slaughterhouse into rural areas. By 2016, wages fell to $22,000 per year. In May 2018, median wages for the 75,000 slaughterhouse workers were just $28,260. In 2020, Indian Packers Corp. offered starting pay of $16.22 per hour or almost $34,000 per year. Some companies are also offering bonuses for new workers. For example, a poultry processor in New Market, Virginia, is offering a $1,500 “stay on bonus.” But many other employers were still offering only $11 or $12 per hour or just $23,000 per year. The industry’s claimed inability to recruit workers is worsened by China’s Wuhan virus, said the pork producers’ March 10 letter: the COVID-19 situation could cause significant capacity shortfalls much sooner and put daily animal care needs at risk. School closures preventing parents from going to work are already a concern in farm and plant communities. The specter of market-ready hogs with nowhere to go is a nightmare for every pork producer in the nation. It would result in severe economic fallout in rural communities and a major animal welfare challenge. We call on federal and state officials to work with the U.S. pork industry to mitigate the impact on our industry and the communities which depend on us. Specifically, we ask for solutions for more and expedited worker visas and for the administration to develop support plans for pig farmers impacted by bottlenecks in the supply chain In 2015, Chinese investors bought the largest pork firm in the United States, Smithfield Foods. Many low-tech American business sectors are now facing problems because their lower-income workforce is being dispersed amid the coronavirus shutdowns. For example, the New York Times reported the hardship caused by the shutdown of the city’s hospitality industry: About 154,400 people work in the city’s bars, restaurants, cafes and food trucks, earning $4.7 billion in wages a year, according to a 2019 city study. The city’s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, estimated on Monday that restaurant sales would decline by 80 percent during the shutdown, a figure that will cripple some businesses. “We have never experienced something like this,” said Daniel Boulud, the chef and restaurateur who owns Daniel. “Everybody is on temporary leave and we hope to bring them back as soon as the green light will come, but we have no idea when.” … Across the East River in Queens, Quy Tran, a 55-year-old waiter and delivery man for a Vietnamese restaurant in Jackson Heights, said he had two or three weeks of cash in the bank. “I feel nervous, scared,” he said, “not about the sickness but about money.” The pork producers’ letter does not say if they are looking for more H-2A or H-2B blue-collar visa workers. H-2B workers are usually used by landscapers, hotels, and resorts — but they are also used by crab producers. In March, Chad Wolf, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, okayed an extra 35,000 H-2B workers for use by companies in 2020. The extra H-2Bs will allow companies to hire 101,000 new H-2Bs throughout 2020 — even though hundreds of thousands of Americans are facing layoffs during the epidemic. Many H-1Bs approved in 2019 and 2018 are also allowed to work in the United States. Tom Cotton: DHS ‘Prioritizing Cheap Foreign Labor’ with H-2B Visa Hikehttps://t.co/mtqDZpux1n — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 5, 2020  In 2019, farm employers imported more than 240,000 H-2A workers, up from 100,000 in 2013. The supply of H-2A farm workers does reduce pressure on companies to invest in labor-saving technology for the slaughterhouses. But the supply may not force down wages for Americans because the H-2A wages are set by the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) — which sets wage levels too high, according to a January 2020 complaint by the Cato Institute: The AEWR is unfair discrimination against farmers who are trying to follow the rules and hire foreign workers legally. It is supposed to reflect the actual hourly wage that farmers are already paying workers. But in practice, this is not the case. …  the AEWR artificially inflates the base hourly wage in the following before including these types of extra compensation. “The AEWR is a political wage that the administration or Congress should terminate,” Cato concluded. Also, many high-tech industries have redesigned their management culture to maximize the use of cheap H-1, OPT, and L-1 visa workers. For example, Silicon Valley companies have imported several hundred thousand white-collar workers from India, despite the risk of civil rights lawsuits and the visible loss of innovation. Nationwide, roughly one million Indian contract workers hold white-collar jobs needed by young American graduates, partly because there are no caps on the inflow of foreign graduates into white-collar U.S. jobs. In the Senate, Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee is pushing his S.386 bill that would reward more Indian graduates if they take jobs from American graduates. DoJ/EEOC do nothing as US & Indian execs trade US jobs to Indian #H1B workers, cutting Americans out of careers, homes & families.This trade choked innovation in Silicon-V, slammed  insurance & banking. #SenMikeLee & #S386 will expand it to healthcare https://t.co/qoENwyO6X7 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 9, 2020 ",U.S. Pork Processors Ask for More Foreign H-2 Visa Workers,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/17/u-s-pork-processors-ask-for-more-foreign-h-2-workers/,Breitbart
"The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Department is implementing a new policy where accused criminals deemed “non-violent” will be quickly released after their arrests in light of the coronavirus crisis. Police officials confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that accused criminals charged with non-violent crimes will be processed and released so as not to fill up city jails. Police officials said those accused criminals considered to be violent will not be released. Police officials said in a statement: It should be noted that if a police officer believes that releasing an individual would pose a threat to public safety, the officer will notify a supervisor, who will review the totality of the circumstances, and in the interest of public safety, utilize discretion in determining the appropriate course of action. Non-violent criminals will be re-arrested later in the year. Police officials confirmed the authenticity of an internal memo that states that those arrested for crimes like burglary, auto theft, vandalism, prostitution, and theft will not be held in jail. Instead, they will be released back into the general public after their arrest. The new arresting procedure comes as crime is up in Philadelphia, especially in categories deemed “non-violent” offenses but that still leave victims in their wake. For instance, compared to this time last year, retail theft in Philadelphia is up 64 percent. Likewise, commercial burglary has increased eight percent, motor vehicle tag theft is up 26 percent, theft from a person is up 16 percent, theft is up 14 percent, and auto theft is up 20 percent. There are at least 18 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Philadelphia. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden is the projected winner of the Democrat presidential primary in Florida. Biden, who led most polls emanating out of the Sunshine State in recent weeks, was declared the winner shortly after the last ballot was cast. Although the official margin is yet to be known, Biden seems to have dispatched his main rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), handily. When the race was called, with nearly 70 percent of precincts reporting, the former vice president led Sanders by more than 40 percentage points—60 percent to 22 percent. Given Biden’s expansive lead, it is likely he will capture the lion’s share of Florida’s 219 delegates. BREAKING: Joe Biden wins the Democratic presidential primary in Florida. #APracecall at 8:00 p.m. EDT. #Election2020 #FLprimary https://t.co/lGfinjTqT4 — AP Politics (@AP_Politics) March 18, 2020  The primary was one of the first to take place after the Coronavirus outbreak was deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As such, turnout was lower than expected across Florida as at-risk populations, mostly the elderly and individuals with compromised immune systems, were advised to stay home to mitigate their risk of infection. Many believed a dropoff among older voters, who make up a substantial part of Florida’s electorate, would impact Biden, as they constitute one of his key demographics. As evidenced by the results, that theory did not pan out. In fact, as exit polling indicates, the burgeoning pandemic may have actually helped the former vice president. According to an NBC News exit poll released Tuesday, 71 percent of Florida voters said they trusted Biden to “handle a major crisis,” while only 23 percent said the same of Sanders. Even without the onset of the pandemic, Biden’s landslide win is not all that surprising. In recent weeks, the former vice president has led Sanders in polling among Florida Democrats since entering the race. Biden’s position was all the more strengthened after dominating wins in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, in the aftermath of which establishment Democrats coalesced behind his candidacy. The consolidation was nowhere stronger than in Florida, where Biden received the backing of every single Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation. Included on the list where high-profile power brokers like former Democratic National Committee chairwoman and congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sanders’ standing among Florida Democrats, although never strong, was also diminished by a number of self-inflicted wounds. Most notably, the self-described Democratic Socialist angered many in the state’s Cuban community by praising the late-dictator Fidel Castro. The ill-will engendered by Sanders’ remarks was best exhibited by Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell(D-FL), who represents a heavily Cuban district in southern Florida. “I find Senator Bernie Sanders’ comments on Castro’s Cuba absolutely unacceptable,” Mucarsel-Powell said publicly at the height of the controversy. “The Castro regime murdered and jailed dissidents, and caused unspeakable harm to too many South Florida families.”",Joe Biden Routs Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democrat Primary,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/17/joe-biden-routs-bernie-sanders-in-floridas-democratic-primary/,Breitbart
"Cities across the United States are releasing hundreds of accused criminals deemed “non-violent,” claiming their release is necessary to ensure the Wuhan, China-originated coronavirus does not spread. Los Angeles County, California In Los Angeles County, California, Sheriff Alex Villanueva confirmed that more than 600 inmates deemed “non-violent” offenders and most at-risk of contracting the coronavirus had been released. Villanueva said, according to the LA Times, officers should be citing and releasing individuals committing non-violent offenses as much as possible rather than booking them into prison. Already, Los Angeles County has dropped their daily arrests from an average of 300 to just 60 over fears of the coronavirus, and officers are instructed to release all accused criminals who have a bail less than $50,000. No coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the county jail. Cook County, Illinois In Cook County, Illinois, where the city of Chicago is located, the sheriff’s department is releasing inmates who are considered “highly vulnerable” to contracting the coronavirus. Officials have yet to say how many inmates have been released from prison thus far. Those being released in Cook County have been deemed “non-violent.” The sheriff’s department is requesting the Cook County Public Defender, the Office of Chief Judge, and the Cook County State’s Attorney to follow their lead in making sure inmates and accused criminals are released. No coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the county jail. Cuyahoga County, Ohio Cuyahoga County, Ohio — home to the most dangerous city in the state, Cleveland — is releasing hundreds of inmates from prison in fear that the coronavirus may spread among the prison population. Judges in Cuyahoga County are even taking measures to quickly get through cases where accused criminals have pleaded guilty and can be readily released or sent home under house arrest measures. Judges held a special Saturday morning session to settle cases with guilty pleas, release inmates, send them to prison, or release them on house arrest. The George Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) praised the release of inmates in Cuyahoga County, asking other counties and states to follow suit: “Mass incarceration is a clear public health risk,” ACLU officials wrote online. “We encourage other states to follow Ohio’s leadership.” Mass incarceration is a clear public health risk.

"Top officials from the Obama-era U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) privately told Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller that they were concerned about the FBI’s conduct in investigating President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor Michael Flynn. Breaking: Senior Obama DOJ officials privately told Mueller they were alarmed by FBI treatment of Flynn, memos show. Believed threat of Logan Act prosecution was a ""stretch"" and Flynn was not properly allowed to have legal counsel. https://t.co/4Z2FuoPPjX — John Solomon (@jsolomonReports) March 16, 2020  The officials suggested that retired Lt. Gen. Flynn did not lie to the FBI about his dealings with Russia despite claims to the contrary and added credence to assertions that the DOJ coerced the former White House official into making a guilty plea on a charge of lying to the bureau. Mueller’s Russia collusion hoax investigation led to Flynn making a guilty plea for allegedly lying to the FBI, which resulted in a conviction. Flynn’s defense lawyer, Sidney Powell, however, has officially requested to withdraw the retired general’s guilty plea on lying to the FBI and have the case dismissed. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump said he is “strongly considering” offering Flynn a full pardon. Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is one of the officials who raised concerns about the FBI investigators’ treatment of Flynn, the Just the News outlet founded by award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon revealed on Monday. Specifically, during her short stint as attorney general, Yates, an Obama holdover, reportedly complained to the Muller team about a January 24, 2017 effort by the FBI to interview Flynn about his dealings with Russia without letting the former White House official know he was under investigation. A May 2018 letter from the Mueller team to the retired general’s lawyers highlights Yates’ concerns. “Yates said it was not always clear what exactly the FBI was doing to investigate Flynn,” the letter stated. According to Yates, the Mueller team briefed her about the Flynn interview the day after she raised concerns, particularly about the FBI’s focus on whether the retired general remembered talking to a Russian official about sanctions. The Mueller team’s letter to Flynn’s lawyers noted: Flynn denied having a conversation about sanctions. Yates did not speak to the interviewing agents herself, but understood from others that the interviewing agents’ assessment was that Flynn showed no ‘tells’ of lying, and it was possible he really did not remember the substance of his calls with [Russian] Ambassador [Sergey] Kislyak. The comments the Muller team’s letter attributes to Yates mark a stark difference from what she told CNN in May 2017 — that Flynn was in a “serious compromise situation, that the Russians had real leverage over him.” Former Acting AG Sally Yates once declared Mike Flynn Russia compromised. But in private, she and other Obama DOJ officials told Mueller they were concerned by FBI treatment of Flynn. One even thought prosecuting him under Logan Act was a “stretch.” https://t.co/4Z2FuoPPjX — John Solomon (@jsolomonReports) March 17, 2020  Remarks made by other DOJ officials further compound the concerns that the FBI lured Flynn into a perjury trap, Just the News pointed out. Among those officials are former Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord and former Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Matthew Axelrod. McCord and Axelrod indicated that Flynn told FBI investigators the truth. Citing DOJ memos, Just the News reported: The documents, which include a letter from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team transmitting exculpatory evidence to Flynn’s defense lawyers in 2018, offer the most detailed montage to date about why Attorney General Bill Barr recently appointed a special prosecutor to review the government’s actions in the Flynn case. Among other things, the correspondence shows: The documents fuel the assertions by Flynn’s lawyer Sidney Powell that the retired lieutenant general should be allowed to withdraw his 2018 guilty plea because the DOJ coerced him into making it. Last month, AG Barr installed a federal prosecutor from outside the U.S. attorney’s office in the U.S. capital to review the criminal case leveled against Flynn. Barr’s decision to appoint the prosecutor came after the DOJ inspector general (IG) exposed a string of abuses by the FBI in obtaining Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretaps on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The wiretaps were part of Mueller’s Russia collusion hoax probe.",Report: Senior Obama DOJ Officials Privately Suggested Flynn Didn’t Lie to FBI,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/17/report-senior-obama-doj-officials-privately-suggested-flynn-didnt-lie-to-fbi/,Breitbart
"The bill, titled the Emergency Money for the People Act, would provide monthly checks between $1,000 and $2,000 to every American who earned less than $130,000 last year. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced Tuesday during the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing that he would work with Senate Republicans to move forward with “sending checks to Americans immediately.” “Americans need emergency cash, now,” Khanna said. “Our economy has to get the stimulus from immediate spending. While we are glad to see that the Trump administration now supports our approach, we can’t wait any longer to see the Secretary’s words translate to action.” “The Trump Administration needs to adopt Rep. Ryan’s and my proposal in full and get this country on the road to recovery,” Khanna added. Ryan stated he is “heartened” to hear that the Trump administration will stand alongside their efforts to send checks to the American people. Ryan said: Many Americans have begun to follow our recommendations to stay home and avoid the spread of coronavirus. Unfortunately, that means many are now missing paychecks or losing their jobs. Our country is already hurting under these unprecedented times and we should take swift, broad-sweeping action to keep working-class Americans on stable footing. Ryan added, “I’m heartened to hear that this Administration has joined Congressman Khanna and me to move forward with putting cash in the pockets of the American people. Time is of the essence, so let’s work together and get Americans the help they need.” An online press release noted: Under the Ryan/Khanna plan, the vast majority of working-class Americans would qualify for this tax relief. Every American adult making up to $130k would receive at least $1k and up to $2k per month for 6 months. Congress could then renew this again for another 6 month period. This would operate as a temporary, emergency Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), allowing the IRS to access 2019 Tax Return Information in order to ease the cutting and sending of the checks. For those individuals who earned $0, were unemployed, or who are currently unemployed will also be eligible. Should the bill go forth and pass, the payments “would not count as income in order to protect eligibility for any of the income-based state or federal government assistance programs.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.","Democrat Reps.

"As Illinois Democrat primary voters head to the polls, state officials confirmed two months ago that hundreds of noncitizens were on the voter rolls in 2018 and many voted. In January, Illinois election officials admitted that about 574 noncitizens were improperly registered to vote in the 2018 election and out of those noncitizens, 19 fraudulently voted. These noncitizens were kept on the voter rolls for more than 500 days. After learning of the “programming error,” Democrat Secretary of State Jesse White’s office did not inform officials with the Board of Elections until December 18, 2019 — indicating that non-citizens were kept on voter rolls for more than 500 days or over 17 months. The error was a direct result of Democrat and Republican state lawmakers’ implementation of an automatic voter registration system. States like New York and California have similar programs. California’s automatic voter registration fraudulently registered about 1,500 ineligible voters, including noncitizens, over six months. Though state lawmakers demanded answers to the issue, Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker refused to temporarily halt the automatic voter registration program, as Breitbart News reported. Illinois is a sanctuary state that shields criminal illegal aliens from arrest and deportation. The state allows illegal aliens to obtain driver’s licenses, which are used by citizens to register to vote. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"MSNBC political analyst and MoveOn.org spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that when President Donald Trump refers to the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” it is “dangerous,” racism. Fill-in host John Heilemann asked, “It seems to me that is what has happened here over the last couple of days that President Trump has realized on the basis of the continued falls in the stock market and some of the briefings that suggest how serious the health impacts can be in the United States, he finally came to the realization that happy talk Trump was not working and was not going to bear up to reality. So he shifted now, and he’s shifted to xenophobic wartime Trump. Where he thinks the only path now is to basically declare the virus public enemy number one, paint it in somewhat racist terms, and say we must defeat this virus and try to take the mantle. That I’m like the Douglas MacArthur, the Dwight Eisenhower, or Harry Truman of virus warfare. Trump is now making that pivot. I’m curious whether you see the same thing, number one. And whether you think that is a strategy that has any chance of working when we also see schizophrenic Trump behaving in different ways on Twitter than he does in the White House briefing room.” Jean-Pierre said, “I wanted to say the xenophobia and racism in the outbreak is such a common thing. We’ve seen it in past health outbreaks we’ve seen in this country’s history. The problem is it’s coming directly from the president of the United States. It is incredibly dangerous. It is problematic, and it is scary. I just want to call that out squarely. You do have people in the Asian-American community whose lives are at risk. For the president to call it a Chinese virus or foreign virus, that’s so dangerous and not a good thing to do obviously.” “In a public health crisis, you need the president, you need our leaders to be consistent,” Jean-Pierre added. “Donald Trump has not given us consistency. One week it’s a hoax. One week it is a crisis. Then the next week, we have a somber, very focused Donald Trump. Five hours later, he is like a wrecking ball on Twitter. Again, that is dangerous, that is scary, and that is not helpful. Donald Trump has 72 million followers on his Twitter account. Imagine if he used that to share important guidelines from CDC or to give factual information to people who are incredibly worried about what’s happening right now in our country. Instead, he attacks Democratic governors. Instead, he tweets about Hillary Clinton. He talks about ratings on the TV show. Yeah, you could say there’s some sort of political trajectory here. He’s throwing red meat at his base, but this is not the time for that.

"The United Auto Workers (UAW) union is asking Ford, General Motors (GM), and Fiat Chrysler to temporarily close their plants to protect American workers from contracting the coronavirus. UAW leaders are in talks with executives at Ford, GM, and Fiat Chrysler to either temporarily close their plants across the country or considerably cut back on production to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading. On the table is an option to close auto plants for two weeks so that workers can quarantine, socially distance, and take further precautions. While the UAW negotiates future production with the nation’s three largest automakers, an American worker at GM’s Warren Technical Center outside Detroit, Michigan has tested positive for coronavirus. The Warren plant employs about 20,000 Americans. “Our thoughts are with our member and their family, coworkers and friends at GM’s Warren Technical Center, who rightfully are worried about their loved one’s health and their exposure to Coronavirus,” UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement. “It is important that our members are quarantined in accordance with [CDC] guidelines,” Dittes said. The UAW is working with GM to inform any members who should be in quarantine.” Similarly, a Ford employee in Dearborn, Michigan has tested positive for coronavirus. Executives said the employee had not been at work since first being exposed to the Wuhan, China-originated virus and thus no other Ford employees are at risk.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said in a statement that as of  Tuesday, he has completed his self-quarantine and will move to advance solutions to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Cruz decided to go into self-quarantine after he came into contact with a CPAC attendee who had tested positive for the Wuhan virus. He went into self-quarantine again later in March after he met with Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Spanish Vox Party, who had later tested positive for the coronavirus. Cruz said: Today marks 14 days since my interaction with a second individual who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, and the end of my extended self-quarantine. I still have no symptoms and feel healthy. From the time the COVID-19 outbreak was first reported, and during my self-quarantine,I’ve been actively working with the administration, my colleagues, state and local officials, and industry leaders in combatting the spread of this disease and protecting human life. The Texas senator said that he will move to address the coronavirus epidemic in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, saying: This is a serious public health crisis and it requires a serious, all-hands-on-deck response. Tomorrow I will return to Washington, D.C., where I will be focused on advancing more common sense, targeted proposals to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and provide relief from the economic impacts of the outbreak. We need to work quickly and we need to be guided by the facts and the medical science, not politics. People’s lives, and their livelihoods, are on the line. At every level, from health experts in our nation’s capital to families in the heart of Texas, we have all taken important steps to flatten the curve and slow the growth of this pandemic. We still have a long road ahead of us before COVID-19 is defeated, with many more steps involved. But together – without panic, hysteria, or partisan games – we can curb this outbreak and eventually stop it in its tracks. Sen. Cruz sent letters to Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services (HHS) Director Alex Azar, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn urging them to take swift action to counter the spread of the coronavirus.

"Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday the Pentagon will provide up to five million N-95 respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators from its strategic reserves to help with the government’s response to the coronavirus. Esper said the first million masks will be made available “immediately.” Esper said the Pentagon will also provide its fourteenth additional lab for testing non-DOD personnel for COVID-19 and hopes to add two more. “We hope this will provide excess capacity,” he said. He said the Pentagon is considering activating National Guard and reserve forces to help states with planning, logistics, and medical support as needed. In addition, he said he has asked the Navy to prepare hospital ships for use in the response, and is planning to talk with state and local leaders about the need for field hospitals. While the ships and field hospitals are not geared towards infectious disease treatment, Esper said they can take patients who are not suffering from COVID-19 and alleviate the strain civilian hospitals are under to provide enough hospital beds in the worst case scenarios. “I’ve made it clear we will continue to support the administration’s comprehensive efforts,” he said. “I want you to know we are all in this together.” The Pentagon said it is looking at what resources it can provide in the response, including providing hospital beds at its 36 nationwide hospitals, and deploying tent hospitals as necessary. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also discussing how they can help with the response. President Trump said the USACE is “ready and willing to help” with the retrofitting and modifying of existing sites into medical centers that can help alleviate a potential hospital bed shortage. National Guard soldiers have also been activated in several states, and are helping with logistics, planning, testing, food delivery, and other tasks.   Follow Breitbart News’ Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.","Pentagon Will Provide Up to 5M Respirator Masks, 2K Ventilators in Coronavirus Response",2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/17/pentagon-will-provide-up-to-5m-respirator-masks-2k-ventilators-in-coronavirus-response/,Breitbart
"China’s coronavirus has infected 22 people in a nursing home in DuPage County, Illinois, forcing officials to declare an emergency. The infection has hit 18 elderly patients and four workers, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced March 17, according to Patch.com The bad news came two days after officials revealed the first infection at the nursing home. The Chicago Tribune reported March 15: DuPage County announced its first case of coronavirus, a woman in her 60s, during a press conference with Governor J.B. Pritzker on Saturday. The woman, who is a resident of Chateau Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Willowbrook, remains hospitalized and is in stable condition, said Ron Nunziato, CEO of Extended Care LLC, a consulting firm that works with the Willowbrook facility. “We do not know how this happened to this resident,” DuPage County Public Health Department Executive Director Karen Ayala said. “However, since she hasn’t traveled or apparently had contact with another COVID case, we are conjecturing at this point that this is another example of community spread.” Presidnet Donald Trump and health officials have warned state and local officials to try to shield nursing homes from the disease, which kills rough 20 percent of people aged 80 and above. On March 13, Trump told a press conference: Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions, and those who are most at risk. They have not done very well. … Especially if they have a health problem, they have not done well. We must take all precautions. The disease has already killed numerous residents of a nursing home in Washington state. Business Insider reported March 11: Before the coronavirus hit the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, 120 seniors lived there. Now there are fewer than 50. The long-term care facility, about 20 minutes north of Seattle, has been battling a coronavirus outbreak for weeks. Since the outbreak started, 26 of the center’s residents have died, 13 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19, the disease the coronavirus causes. Some others who died have not yet been tested. The Kirkland deaths came at the very start of the epidemic when there was no shortage of hospital resources. Illinois officials said they are trying to identify the source of the infection, before the source — likely a person — infects another site: Individuals who have come in close contact with the woman have been given both verbal and written instructions on what to do. Ayala defined close contact as being within six feet of the woman for at least 10 minutes. Though Ayala could not put a number to the number of people who had come in close contact with the woman, Ayala noted that the average in such cases is about 90 people per case. One traveler from China directly about 30 people with coronavirus in the Seattle area during January and Feb. No report yet on far those infections have spread onwards.

"Joe Biden’s (D) national lead in the Democrat primary race is narrowing, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday. The survey, taken March 13-16, 2020, showed the former vice president losing his double-digit lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who trails the former vice president in current pledged delegate totals. “If the 2020 Democratic presidential primary election were held today, and you had to choose from the list of candidates below, for whom would you vote?” the survey asks. Biden leads Sanders among registered Democrat voters, 48 percent to 39 percent. Biden led in the same poll one week ago by 21 percentage points. Two percent of Democrat voters indicated support for Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and eight percent said they “don’t know” whom they would support. The sample size and margin of error were not immediately available. The news comes as voters in three more states, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, cast their ballots for their preferred candidate in Tuesday’s election. Biden needs 50.4 percent of the remaining delegates in order to secure the Democrat nomination on the first ballot.

"Australia declared a “human biosecurity emergency” on Wednesday as Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned the country’s citizens should cease all overseas travel because of the coronavirus pandemic. The formal declaration – the first in the nation’s history – gives the government powers to close off cities or regions, impose curfews and order people to quarantine, if deemed necessary to contain the spread of the virus. The upgrade in official advice to an unprecedented “Level 4: Do not travel” to any country in the world, was accompanied by a ban on any non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. The conservative coalition leader cautioned the government was preparing for the impact of the pandemic to last six months or more. “We are going to keep Australia running. We are going to keep Australia functioning. It won’t look like it normally does but it is very important that we continue to put in place measures that are scalable and sustainable,” Morrison said in a nationally televised address from the national capital, Canberra. “There is no two-week answer to what we’re confronting. There is no short-term, quick fix to how this is dealt with in Australia. The idea that you can just turn everything off for two weeks and then turn it all back on again and it all goes away, that is not the evidence, that is not the facts, that is not the information and it is not our way through this.” <span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> The hospitality, tourism and event sectors are predicted to be those worst hit as social distancing measures are intensified to curb the virus’s spread.

He will be dropping out soon!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Biden easily beat Sanders in the Democrat primaries in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona on Tuesday. The president painted it as a victory for the Democrat establishment. “The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule,” Trump said. “Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters.

"U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Wednesday doubled down on his belief that the nation has hit a pivotal point in combating the coronavirus pandemic. Adams told NBC “Today” host Savannah Guthrie he feels the United States has “turned the corner on testing.” “I think we’re starting to turn a corner, and people really are [sensing the urgency],” Adams stated. “It’s because it’s starting to affect people who they see and know.” He added, “Look, chances are you don’t have coronavirus. Chances are if you do you’ll recover based on Korea data, 99.3 percent of people recover. But what we don’t want to do is have you or other people out there spreading it to people who are at higher risk.” Adams emphasized the importance of Americans to participate in the “15 days to stop the spread initiative.” “We’re telling people that we really want them to avoid gatherings of 10 or more,” he outlined. “We want them to avoid any unnecessary travel. We want them to work from home if at all possible or not go in. The reason why we framed it that way is because when we look at the data, our numbers are where Italy’s were two to three weeks ago. So, we really have a choice to make right now as a nation: Do we want to go the way of Italy and see our numbers increase rapidly, or do we want to go the way of South Korea and China who aggressively leaned into mitigation measures and were able to level off their peak and are now seeing significantly decreased number of cases?” Adams continued, “We feel like if we can get America to all pitch in for the next 15 days, we can flatten the curve, which is a term you’ve been hearing a lot, not overwhelm our health care systems and hopefully get through this.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Surgeon General: ‘I Really Feel Like We’ve Turned the Corner on Testing this Week’,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/18/surgeon-general-i-really-feel-like-weve-turned-the-corner-on-testing-this-week/,Breitbart
"A trade organization dedicated to the interests of truck drivers is “extremely disappointed” in Pennsylvania officials for shutting down rest areas due to the coronavirus, saying the areas are critical to drivers who play a vital role in keeping the country’s supply chain open. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) announced Monday that it was closing the areas as part of the state’s effort to prevent further spread of the deadly illness. “We understand this decision was likely made in an effort to limit passenger vehicle movement, interaction among travelers, and the state’s administration and supervision of these facilities during an emergency declaration,” the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said in a Tuesday statement. “However, rest areas are vitally important to truckers, who at this time are being heavily relied upon to transport critical supplies across the country.” “Pennsylvania is a major contributor to the nation’s economy and its location between the Northeast region and markets in the South and Midwest means countless truckers move across the state each day,” the statement added. “Many of these truckers rely on the state’s rest areas to do just that – rest!” In response, PennDOT said rest areas on the Pennsylvania Turnpike will remain open, as will privately-owned truck stops. “PennDOT’s rest areas are currently closed, but we are routinely evaluating our position relative to the effort to mitigate the impact of COVID-19,” PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said in an email statement to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “We must also consider the ability of our contract cleaners to provide staffing adequate to maintain clean, safe and sanitary facilities within our rest areas while limiting the exposure risk to [commercial motor vehicle] drivers as well as staff.” The Turnpike has closed all fast-food restaurants and indoor bathrooms at all 17 rest areas. However, gas stations will remain open and portable toilets will be installed outside the rest stop buildings. Pennsylvania has 96 cases of the coronavirus as Tuesday, up 20 from the beginning of the week. The U.S. has 6,496 cases and 114 deaths, according to data via John Hopkins University.",Coronavirus: Truckers ‘Extremely Disappointed’ Pennsylvania Has Shut Down Rest Stops,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/coronavirus-truckers-extremely-disappointed-pennsylvania-has-shut-down-rest-stops/,Breitbart
"Zimbabwe’s defense minister claimed God was “punishing” America and other Western states with the Chinese coronavirus for imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Associated Press reported on Monday. Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri allegedly made the observation – which seemingly mocked Western nations currently victims of the Chinese coronavirus, originating in Wuhan – at a rally for ruling party leaders on Saturday in Chinhoyi, 75 miles northwest of Harare. She announced: This coronavirus that has come are sanctions against the countries that have imposed sanctions on us. God is punishing them now and they are staying indoors now while their economy is screaming like what they did to ours by imposing sanctions on us. [U.S. President Donald] Trump should know that he is not a God. Zimbabwe has not registered a single Chinese coronavirus case. However, according to the Senior Hospitals Doctors Association, the country is ill-prepared to detect or treat the virus. A recent study by doctors at France’s Sorbonne University agrees, arguing that “some countries remain ill-equipped” in Africa to handle the threat. One of the study’s authors, Dr. Vittoria Colizza, added that, in African countries, more efforts are needed in regard to “surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, patient isolation and contact tracing.” The United States and other Western countries have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe for years over human rights abuses under longtime dictator Robert Mugabe, deposed by his former vice president in 2017. Last week, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe officials for ordering an attack on peaceful protesters and mistreating members of an opposition party. According to a statement by the U.S. Treasury Department, Zimbabwe State Security Minister Owen Ncube ordered security services to abduct and mistreat members of the opposition group. The statement also said Anselem Sanyatwe, Zimbabwe’s ambassador to Tanzania, directed security forces to attack protesters during demonstrations after the country’s 2018 elections; Sanyatwe was a national army commander at the time. Violence broke out after the 2018 election results were delayed, resulting in the death of six protesters. Justifying the sanctions – which essentially freeze any U.S.-held assets of the two officials and prohibit Americans from engaging in business with them – Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich said, “Political and military leaders in Zimbabwe have repeatedly used violence to silence dissent and peaceful protests.” Despite these sanctions, the United States, along with Britain and other European countries, remain among Zimbabwe’s most generous donors, providing regular relief in the form of food, aid, and medicine to the struggling nation. On social media, many reportedly criticized Muchinguri’s comments for ignoring Zimbabwe’s troublingly close relationship with China, one of its biggest political allies. On Monday, opposition party leader Nelson Chamisa criticized Zimbabwean leaders for blaming the Chinese coronavirus for political failings, alluding to Muchinguri-Kashiri’s comments. “We should not be partisan about it, because diseases are non-partisan … We cannot afford to talk politics,” Chamisa reportedly said. “Health is beyond politics, but it is about life, we can’t go into politics, we cannot wish others bad thinking that we will not get this kind of problem … This is Zimbabwe and this the time for us to unite as a people and do what we know best to defend our being as a people.”",Zimbabwe Defense Chief: ‘God Is Punishing’ America with Chinese Coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/03/18/zimbabwe-defense-chief-god-is-punishing-america-with-chinese-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"The Idaho Senate voted Monday to approve the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act (HB 500a), which would ban biological males who identify as female from competing on girls’ and women’s athletic teams. The bill passed the State Senate, 24-11, after being approved by the House in February, 52-17. The House must approve a Senate amendment to the bill prior to sending it to the desk of Gov. Brad Little (R) for his signature. The State Senate approval means Idaho could become the first state in the nation to protect girls’ and women’s sports from an ideology that makes gender identity subservient to biological science. Left-wing LGBT activists and their media allies are attempting to shame members of the Idaho legislature who voted to protect girls’ and women’s sports as the coronavirus pandemic continues. “This is downright shameful,” tweeted GLSEN, which pushes LGBT sexual relationships and gender ideology in state-mandated comprehensive sex ed curricula and in public school districts. “In the face of a global pandemic, the #Idaho Senate spent yesterday passing a dangerous bill that singles out #transgender students for discrimination,” the group complained: This is downright shameful: In the face of a global pandemic, the #Idaho Senate spent yesterday passing a dangerous bill that singles out #transgender students for discrimination. https://t.co/LY5vOhb5b1 #IDLeg — GLSEN (@GLSEN) March 17, 2020  Hey #IDLeg: How about we all come together to find solutions during this global crisis – and drop this senseless attack on #transgender students?

Mary Souza (R), one of the bill’s sponsors, according to the Idaho Press. Souza also told her fellow lawmakers fearful of the bill drawing a lawsuit that a “third-party group that has been working with us on this bill … will be responsible for any legal defense fees.” “So, is there a problem now?” she asked, and added: Not in Idaho. Although there was a young man on a track team in eastern Idaho who decided a year ago that he wanted to run on the girls’ team. He was on the boys’ track team, and he wanted to sign up for the girls’ track team. And he thought about it, talked to the coach and made a decision not to do that. I don’t know any of the details, but that’s what the outcome was. It’s coming. The issue is in states across the country. Left-wing media Vox also attempted to shame Idaho lawmakers who voted to approve the trans athlete ban during the coronavirus crisis. The headline on its story about the bill read, “While the country deals with the coronavirus, Idaho state legislators prioritize banning trans athletes.” LGBT media outlet Logo NewNowNext headlined the story with, “Despite Pandemic, Idaho Passes Ban on Trans Student Athletes.” “Idaho has at least seven coronavirus cases, but lawmakers took aim at trans kids,” the outlet added. While we were all wondering how we were going to get by in groups smaller than 10..Idaho’s House of Rep got 70 people in a room to pass HB500..56-13..Idaho is a gov signature away from being 1st state to limit transgender athletes.. — KTVB Brian Holmes (@KTVBBrian) March 17, 2020  UPDATE: that vote was to amend the bill..vote still needs to be held on actually passing the amended HB500..so still one step away from @GovernorLittle's desk..but still..70 people gathered in a room today.. — KTVB Brian Holmes (@KTVBBrian) March 17, 2020  In a similar way, Planned Parenthood attacked the firestorm over House Democrats’ insistence to push for taxpayer funding of abortion in a loophole in the coronavirus spending bill. The abortion giant complained: Using this very real public health emergency to attack abortion coverage shows a despicable lack of concern about the severity of this crisis. These politicians will do anything to advance their anti-abortion agenda.

According to a press release from WILL, the school policy, issued in April 2018, trains district employees to “conceal and even deceive parents about the gender identity their son or daughter has adopted at school.” The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest LGBT activist group, condemned the approval of the bill banning transgender athletes by the Idaho Senate, calling it “discriminatory.” .@HRC data shows that nearly half of all LGBTQ youth say their families make them feel bad for their sexual orientation or gender identity.

These elected officials and the groups backing them are proposing a ‘solution’ in search of a problem — and using transgender kids as pawns to stoke division at a time when our elected leaders should be finding ways to unite us. If HB 500 becomes law, it will send a strong message to trans youth that they are less than their peers and not deserving of community and acceptance. HRC states it appreciates its partners, among them the ACLU, Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii, and the Pride Foundation. Breitbart News sought comment from supposed women’s rights groups Planned Parenthood and the National Organization for Women on the plight of three Connecticut female high school runners who have now filed a federal lawsuit that aims to safeguard fairness in women’s sports, but neither organization responded. Some transgender activists have falsely claimed there is no scientific evidence that suggests biological males identifying as females have an unfair advantage over biological female athletes. However, as Breitbart News reported, a recent study conducted by the Karolinska Institute and Linkoping University in Sweden found biological males — who claim to be transgender women — who were administered a full year of hormone therapy, still maintained muscle mass and strength advantages over biological women. “Despite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in TM, the TW were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12months of treatment,” the researchers observed. “These findings add new knowledge that could be relevant when evaluating transwomen’s eligibility to compete in the women’s category of athletic competitions. “Our results indicate that after 12 months of hormonal therapy, a transwoman will still likely have performance benefits over a cis-woman [biological woman],” they concluded. In another study published at BMJ and released in July, three professors — two in bioethics and one in physiology — concluded that male athletes who claim to be female hold an “intolerable” advantage over biological female athletes. The study was conducted after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced it would allow “transgender women” to compete against biological females if their testosterone is below 10 nmol/L. However, even that level is “significantly higher” than that of biological females, the authors said. They cited research demonstrating that “healthy young men did not lose significant muscle mass (or power) when their circulating testosterone levels were reduced” for 20 weeks to meet the IOC’s guidelines. The researchers also noted that “indirect effects of testosterone will not be altered by hormone therapy.” “For example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions postpuberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained,” they explained. “We conclude that the advantage to transwomen afforded by the IOC guidelines is an intolerable unfairness,” stated the professors.",Idaho Senate Approves Bill to Protect Women’s Sports from Transgender Athletes,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/idaho-senate-approves-bill-to-protect-womens-sports-from-transgender-athletes/,Breitbart
"China censured the U.S. Wednesday for its “incorrect” characterization of the global coronavirus pandemic as Chinese in origin as it re-asserted the “right” to expel three American newspaper journalists and bar them even from working in nearby Hong Kong. Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang delivered a series of instructions for the U.S. from the Communist state at a regular press briefing, saying it would not hesitate to take further action against U.S. media and journalists in China if the United States did not “correct its mistakes.” “The U.S. has said that all options are on the table. Today, I can also tell the U.S. that all options are on the table for China,” Geng said. The foreign ministry maintained American citizens working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post with credentials expiring before the end of the year must surrender their press cards within 10 days. As Breitbart News reported, Beijing flagged the move Tuesday saying it would ban American citizen journalists from several mainstream publications from working in China, claiming it represented a “reciprocal” measure to the U.S. State Department limiting Chinese state media staff to 100 Chinese nationals per media outlet. China’s move accelerated a tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington over press freedom, raised questions about Hong Kong’s autonomy under a one country, two systems” agreement that prevails between the former U.K. territory and the mainland. But under Hong Kong’s Basic Law, as its mini constitution is known, Beijing is ultimately responsible for foreign affairs and defense in the former British colony, Reuters reports. Geng said the expulsions were in response to U.S. actions and the decision to oust them, and block them from Hong Kong, fell under Beijing’s diplomatic purvue. The Trump administration designated five Chinese state media outlets — Xinhua, China Daily, Hai Tian Development USA, China Global Television Network (CGTN), and China Radio International — “foreign missions” last month because their purpose is not to share news but to promote the agenda of the Communist Party. “Unlike foreign media organizations in China, these entities are not independent news organizations,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in February, explaining the limits on the number of Chinese propagandists allowed to operate in the United States. At the time, China branded the restrictions a “ridiculous war against Chinese media.” Geng earlier said the United States needs to cease directing “unwarranted accusations” at China, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump described the new strain of coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus” on Twitter. “Some U.S. political figures have recently been connecting the coronavirus with China,” Geng warned. “We express strong indignation and objection to such stigmatization.” The official Chinese spokesman said describing the coronavirus as Chinese violates principles set out by various international agencies, although he declined to name them or point to their direct warning against ever publicly criticizing Communist China. Geng also took the opportunity to attack the U.S. response to the pandemic that first started in the southern China city of Wuhan. “As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads and worsens all over the world, the urgent task for the international community is to respond with aggressive and concerted efforts,” he said. “The United States should get its domestic issues handled first.” UPI contributed to this report",China Instructs U.S. to ‘Correct Its Mistakes’ and Think Proper Thoughts About Coronavirus Origins,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/18/china-expels-american-reporters-instructs-u-s-to-correct-its-mistakes/,Breitbart
"The abortion industry has been more successful than many other propaganda groups in making lies take hold in the public imagination through repetition. Examples include: “It’s not a baby; it’s just a clump of cells.” “Thousands of women died every year from unsafe abortion before Roe v. Wade.” “Abortion is health care.” Every one of these assertions is demonstrably false. Yet one of the most pervasive and dangerous lies promulgated by abortionists and their friends in government and the media is that abortion is safer than childbirth. The lie is so deeply ingrained in the pro-abortion psyche that even Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg repeated it during oral arguments earlier this month in an important abortion case from Louisiana. “Among medical procedures, first-trimester abortion is among the safest – far safer than childbirth,” Ginsburg said, failing to attribute this “fact” to any reliable source – as the abortion advocates have failed to do since Roe v. Wade. This old – and specious – claim was demolished in the amicus briefs filed for the case of June Medical Services v. Russo. The American Center for Law and Justice, the American Academy of Medical Ethics, and the American College of Pediatricians submitted a brief in support of a Louisiana law that requires hospital admitting privileges for abortionists. On page 17 of the 119-page brief, they wrote: No one expects to see an ambulance pulling away from a dermatology or dental office. Yet ambulances are a not uncommon sight at abortion facilities. This sorry fact is just one of many that belie the abortion industry myth that abortion is safe and routine, even safer than childbirth. As demonstrated below, abortion in fact is a hazardous procedure that all too often results in serious complications. Moreover, the common claim of abortion advocates that abortion is safer than childbirth is based upon incomplete data and flagrantly inapt comparisons. The published medical evidence strongly suggests that abortion is more dangerous, not less, than childbirth. The brief documents 72 instances of women being taken by ambulance from abortion businesses in 2019 alone. Perhaps that seems a very small number, given the annual carnage caused by legal child-killing, but the brief also notes that the only way the public finds out about abortion injuries is when pro-lifers are outside the facilities to take note. “There is every reason to believe this list is just the tip of the iceberg,” the brief explains. “The news media do not, as a rule, report on medical emergencies at abortion facilities.” The names of 10 young women killed by legal abortion in recent years were also included in the brief. Some of these deaths generated a story or two in each woman’s local media, but certainly not the wall-to-wall national coverage that followed the death of Kanye West’s mother after cosmetic surgery. Moms who die from abortion are just the under-reported collateral damage of the killing machine that is legal abortion. The brief analyzes the ways that the relative “safety” of abortion is compared to childbirth, suggesting that in the end it boils down to which statistics are included and which are omitted. Here’s a sampling of some of these errors, as spelled out in the brief. The story of Keisha Atkins, mentioned but not detailed in the brief, is a heart-breaking example of an abortion death cover-up. Keisha died during a second-trimester abortion in New Mexico. She had been in medical distress for more than nine hours before the abortion clinic transferred her to the hospital, and physicians there waited several more hours before taking her to the operating room, where she died.  An autopsy later blamed her death on a pulmonary embolism, a leading cause of maternal mortality. In other words, the autopsy alleged that the pregnancy killed her, not the abortion. But a string of emails from various hospital personnel questioned the autopsy conclusion, with one physician reporting being “floored” by the assertion. A more realistic cause of death, they said, was sepsis. By the time Keisha died, her dead daughter had been in her womb for more than 60 hours. This is a known cause of sepsis. The abortion killed Keisha. To find factual information about abortion deaths, the brief’s authors had to look abroad to studies performed in Finland, Norway, and Denmark, because in this country, pro-abortion researchers funded by pro-abortion foundations perform the bulk of the peer-reviewed studies. The vast majority conclude that abortion is a “safe” procedure. But in the studies from abroad, abortion was not found to be safer than childbirth. The brief concludes: Abortion is a procedure fraught with hazards. The notion that abortion is safer than childbirth rests on inapposite comparisons and incomplete data, flies in the face of far more rigorous peer-reviewed studies, and should not be relied upon by this Court for any purposes. The Supreme Court is expected to release its opinion in the Louisiana case in June. Whether the coronavirus pandemic and the postponement of oral arguments in other cases will come to bear on this timetable is unknown. One can only hope that the justices take their time making their way through briefs like this one that tell the truth about abortion. Women’s lives depend on it. Fr.

"“I’m not a virus. I’m human. Eradicate the prejudice.” This was the message of videos released in northern Italy in February this year, urging Italians to hug Chinese people to encourage them in the fight against the coronavirus. Here is one of the videos, showing a Chinese girl in Milan exchanging hugs with passers-by. Here is another, set in Florence this time, in which a Chinese man wearing a surgical mask (which he later removes) also offers himself up for hugs by Italian people in the street. These videos — as the saying goes — have not aged well. Northern Italy is now the home of the Coronavirus’s deadliest cluster, with hospitals overwhelmed, approaching 2,000 dead and the entire country in lockdown. Pity the poor fools who were seduced into giving out hugs when, really, the sensible money was on scaling back close physical contact with strangers. The videos were put out by Associazione Unione Giovani Italo Cinesi, a local organisation, funded by the Chinese government. What’s clear now, is that they belong to an era which no longer exists. Dutch Priorities: Amsterdam Potheads Panic Buy Marijuana As Govt Orders Coronavirus Store Closures https://t.co/RmuXo45KFD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 17, 2020  Imagine the response the Chinese government would get now if they tried to make such a propaganda video on the streets of Italy. (If the streets weren’t on lockdown, that is). Those friendly Chinese folk in the video would be more likely to get lynched than hugged — not least because Italians have now woken up to the fact that being discriminating about who you get up-close and personal with can sometimes be beneficial: a life-saver even. Until quite recently the Chinese Communist Party — ably assisted by its useful idiots in the liberal Western MSM — has fought a largely successful propaganda war. It has persuaded the media to focus on how amazing it is that China can put together a series of jerry-built hospitals in six days — and ignore the fact that we wouldn’t be in this mess if the Chinese authorities hadn’t covered up the outbreak for so long in the first place. It has persuaded idiots on CNN — and elsewhere — that it is somehow racist to use phrases like Wuhan Flu, or Wu Flu, even though Wuhan (that’s in China, by the way) is where this Chinese contagion originated. And, for a time, it even managed to persuade some gullible fools to swallow politically correct guff like the message in those flagrant and dangerous propaganda videos. The Mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, actually lent his support to that ‘hug a Chinese person’ campaign. Woke culture has imbued us with the notion that ‘racism’ is the worst crime in the world, and that pushed a lot of people into a mad dash to virtue-signal about how good and wonderful they are by putting themselves at risk. But you’d have to be frankly suicidal to give out free hugs in certain Italian cities now — to Chinese tourists or anyone else. It is a simple and observable fact that woke culture is becoming an unmourned casualty of Coronavirus. When your relatives are dying, when your country has closed down, when your economy is collapsing, woke identity politics suddenly becomes a luxury you can no longer afford.

"Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has rejected the suggestion that the UK should delay the Brexit transition period leaving date because of the coronavirus pandemic. The UK is currently in a transition period where it remains tied to the EU’s rules and has continued access to the Customs Union and Single Market until December 31st, 2020 despite being theoretically free of the bloc. During this time, London and Brussels negotiators will agree on a trade deal; if one is not agreed, the UK will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms at the end of the year. Addressing the House of Commons chamber on Tuesday, Mr Raab said that, “if anything”, the coronavirus crisis demonstrates “the case for intensive diplomacy to get this deal done and move on and take the relationship [with the EU] to the next level”. The foreign secretary made the remarks in response to a call by Exeter Labour MP Ben Bradshaw that the UK and EU should “urgently” agree on an extension to the transition period in order to avoid the “shock” of a “no-deal Brexit”. “We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need,” Mr Raab also said in response to a question on delaying negotiations by Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. Last week, Labour leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy had said that the UK “must” extend the transition period because of the Wuhan virus’s impact on the economy.

On Friday, the UK and EU announced that face-to-face negotiations slated for this week in London would be postponed, while negotiators explore alternatives including video-conferencing. It would not be impossible, given that G7 leaders were able to hold an emergency meeting on coronavirus on Monday across multiple time zones via videoconferencing. There have been a number of reports by the establishment media in recent weeks demanding that the UK’s exit from the bloc’s institutions be postponed. Sociologist Frank Furedi wrote for Spiked on Monday that “‘experts'” were turning coronavirus “into a battleground for pre-existing political and cultural conflicts”, including Brexit. Citing an article in The Observer, which portends that “Brexit means coronavirus vaccine will be slower to reach the UK”, Emeritus Professor Furedi wrote that the Sunday sister paper of the liberal-left Guardian’s “casual transformation of Brexit into a threat to public health is a classic example of politicising an illness”. Citing other examples in the left-wing press, he added: “The fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic and yet raging against the Tories and Brexit still motivates much of the media class confirms that the UK faces far more difficulties than the threat of Covid-19.” Coronavirus Could Delay Brexit Talks, But Transition Won’t Be Extended, Says Minister https://t.co/Nq4wdhV4XG — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 12, 2020 ",Brexit: Raab Rejects Transition Extension Because of Coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/18/brexit-raab-rejects-transition-extension-because-coronavirus/,Breitbart

"Tech giant Facebook recently admitted that it marked posts linking to genuine information and articles about the Wuhan coronavirus as spam, blaming a “bug in an anti-spam system.” The Verge reported that on Tuesday evening, information began rolling in across social media that Facebook was labeling some posts and articles about the Wuhan coronavirus as spam, even when the articles were genuine and factual. The spam label drastically reduces the engagement on Facebook posts, in many cases making them essentially disappear. Users across Twitter began posting about the phenomenon: .@Facebook — Oh wow and then three in a row !  How is @TomHanks being okay be SPAM?

Rosen’s tweet about the issue can be seen below in a reply to former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos: We're on this – this is a bug in an anti-spam system, unrelated to any changes in our content moderator workforce. We're in the process of fixing and bringing all these posts back. More soon. — Guy Rosen (@guyro) March 17, 2020  In another tweet, Rosen explained: “We’ve restored all the posts that were incorrectly removed, which included posts on all topics — not just those related to COVID-19. This was an issue with an automated system that removes links to abusive websites, but incorrectly removed a lot of other posts too.” It was reported earlier this week that multiple Silicon Valley tech firms have stated that they’re working together to fight misinformation surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic. Facebook published a joint statement from the tech firms on its website this week. The joint statement from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube reads: We are working closely together on COVID-19 response efforts. We’re helping millions of people stay connected while also jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus, elevating authoritative content on our platforms, and sharing critical updates in coordination with government healthcare agencies around the world. We invite other companies to join us as we work to keep our communities healthy and safe. While the firms are under immense pressure to crack down on fake news relating to the virus, anti-spam systems restricting the spread of accurate information also causes major issues.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is assessing his campaign following Joe Biden’s (D) sweep in Tuesday’s primary elections, his campaign manager Faiz Shakir said on Wednesday. Biden defeated Sanders in every state that voted on Tuesday — Florida, Arizona, and Illinois — by significant margins. The former vice president secured Florida by almost 40 percentage points, Arizona by 12 percentage points, and Illinois by 23 percentage points, according to the latest updates on Wednesday morning. With that, as well as his losses on Super Tuesday and “mini” Super Tuesday in mind, Sanders is assessing his campaign. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,” Shakir said in a statement Wednesday. “Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” Shakir added. At this point in the race, Biden leads Sanders by 292 delegates, taking what the New York Times describes as an “all but insurmountable lead.” According to NPR’s updated delegate tally, Sanders, who has 861 delegates, would need a majority, or 62.9 percent of the remaining available delegates to seal the nomination. Biden, who boasts 1,153 pledged delegates, needs 46.6 percent of the remaining delegates to win the nomination. The numbers clearly favor Biden, who has remained on an upward trajectory since his victory in South Carolina. A candidate needs 1,991 to win the nomination on the first ballot. However, it remains to be seen how the coronavirus pandemic could shape the remainder of the race. Several states — including Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, Maryland, and Ohio — have postponed their elections, meaning it could take longer for the party to finalize the Democrat nominee. President Trump weighed in on the state of the Democrat race on Wednesday and predicted that Sanders will be “dropping out soon”: The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG — Donald J.

"Gun sales in Colorado jumped 100 percent last week in reaction to the ongoing coronavirus threat and looming prospect of civil unrest should a worse-case scenario arise. KDVR reports some 14,000 firearms were sold in the state just last week, and that is a 100 percent increase over the 7,000 that were sold in that same week one year ago. Joe Oltmann, owner of DCF Guns in Castle Rock, Colorado, said, “The panic started with toilet paper, then moved to food. Then, obviously when people see bare shelves, then obviously they want to make sure they will protected if it gets any worse.” Oltmann said many of the buyers are getting a gun for the first time; that the virus and possibilities of unrest associated with it have them thinking about defending themselves and their families. As a result he admitted business is booming, but said he wished the cause of the increased business was not a virus. He said, “The good part about this is that business is good for us. The bad part about this is I wish it wasn’t this good just based on the circumstances.” Ammunition sales have risen dramatically during the coronavirus scare as well. On March 17, 2020, Breitbart News reported that Ammo.com saw a 276 percent increase in ammo sales last week. In Colorado specifically, Ammo.com saw a 730 percent increase in ammo sales.

"How’s Grandpa Joe Biden’s gun-grabbing looking now, I mean in a world where the Democrat-led Philadelphia publicly announced there will be no jail time for burglary, car theft, vandalism… Where non-violent crimes, like someone robbing your home, will be met with a bench warrant instead of the hoosegow? Since no one’s going to prison for non-violent crime, I have a question… Is looting a violent crime? Isn’t looting merely property damage + burglary? ‘Scuse me. I may have to take a couple of days off for a trip to Philly so I can upgrade my stereo system. Meanwhile, in other Democrat-led cities, a Democrat mayor just banned gun and ammunition sales, which is the same as banning the right for you to defend yourself, your home, and your family. New Orleans could be next. Yeah, freakin’ New Orleans. How would you like to helpless in New Orleans? Oh, and did I forget to mention that in New York City, in a single precinct, police staffing is down 17 percent due to sick calls. One police officer in that precinct tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus. In summation… A major Democrat-led city just told the criminal world Philadelphia is a free-for-all. A New York police precinct is short staffed. Democrat mayors either have or are contemplating banning the sales of guns and ammunition. Not to get all I Told You So-ey on you, but did I not tell you so…? Did I not urge everyone out there to buy guns and ammo? Why, yes — yes, I did… And for two very good reasons… The gun-grabbing fanaticism in this country is not only real, we have never seen anything like it before. Which means the Never-Let-A-Crisis-Go-To-Waste party will never let a crisis go to waste, even a pandemic. I don’t want to get all alarmist, but here’s what I do know… Between Sunday March 7 and Sunday March 14, things went from Zero to Crazy. And when I went out on Sunday night to purchase more ammunition and my wife suggested we already had “plenty of ammunition,” I told her that if things can get this crazy in one week, what are things going to look like next week? Or the week after? Well, here we are in the early days of the “week after” and Democrat-led Philly is promoting the equivalent of The Purge for crimes like burglary and vandalism, while other Democrats are banning or looking to ban our right to defend ourselves. The gun control nuts’ primary argument is, Why do you need all those guns in a country that’s so safe and prosperous, in a democracy?” And we would answer, “Because this could easily break down. Because governments can become tyrannical.” And they would then call us paranoid and crazy and alarmists and GunTards. Well, here we are… This is how crazy thing got in ten days. This is how crazy Democrats got in ten days. Now ask yourself… How crazy will they look ten days from now?

"During a Wednesday appearance on “Fox & Friends,” Sen. Martha McSally (R-AZ) sounded off on the White House’s proposed $1 trillion coronavirus stimulus package to help out families unable to work due to the pandemic. McSally said senators’ hearts are “heavy” right now thinking about how families are affected by the coronavirus, adding Congress wants to “act quickly” to get cash into American workers’ hands. “Our hearts all go out to the people who are struggling right now with coronavirus, their families, seniors and the vulnerable who are deeply concerned about their own health and the healthcare workers on the front lines,” McSally told Fox News. “So, everybody’s hearts are heavy.” She added, “We want to act. We want to act quickly. And we want to make sure that we get resources, cash, directly to American workers, families. You know, those in Arizona, I met with just this weekend, like the single mom down the street with three kids who has a food truck. She’s literally out of business right now because everything’s canceled. And I saw her at the supermarket with an empty cart looking for what she could do to support her family. We need a check to her and everyone like her as quickly as possible and the small businesses who support the economy that are being hurt right now.” McSally went on to emphasize the importance of ensuring people have the money to pay rent and buy food. “The impact is significant and it’s our responsibility to ensure people have cash to pay their rent, to buy food so that we can protect seniors, the vulnerable and healthcare workers and flatten this curve so we can beat this virus and get on the other side of it and get back to a stronger America,” she stated.

"Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite who allegedly operated as Jeffrey Epstein’s “madam” in procuring underage girls for sexual predation, has filed a civil lawsuit against the deceased criminal’s estate, seeking the recoupment of her mounting legal bills. Maxwell, who is reportedly under federal investigation for her alleged role in Epstein’s child sex trafficking activities, alleges that the once-high flying investor made “clear and unambiguous” promises to provide her with financial assistance, read court filings in the United States Virgin Islands. “Maxwell reasonably and justifiably relied on Epstein’s promises and put her trust in Epstein that he would fulfill his promises,” reads the lawsuit the filed in Superior Court in St. Thomas last week. Maxwell’s U.S. Virgin Islands-based attorney, Kyle Waldner, did not reply to a request for comment for ABC News and other media outlets. Since Epstein’s death on August 10, Maxwell’s whereabouts have been the subject of intense speculation. Over the summer, Maxwell’s friend and lawyer, Leah Saffian, reportedly staged a photo of her eating at In-n-Out burger while reading The Book of Honor: The Secret Lives and Deaths of CIA Operatives. The Daily Mail reported of the photo: “According to the photograph’s metadata, reviewed by DailyMail.com, the photograph is tagged with ‘Meadowgate’. Metadata provides information about the rights of the photograph to users. Saffian is president of Meadowgate Media Investments Inc, according to public records. The In-N-Out burger joint picture was published by the New York Post on Thursday after they obtained it from Saffian, 60.” Other reports have claimed Maxwell is living in Paris and with technology CEO Scott Borgerson in Massachusetts; however, he told reporters that the claim is false.

"Iranian state media issued a dire warning to its citizens on Tuesday about the severity of the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic, suggesting “millions” could die across the country if people keep ignoring medical advice. State television journalist and medical doctor Dr. Afruz Eslami gave the warning on Tuesday citing a study by Tehran’s prestigious Sharif University of Technology, which outlined three possible scenarios to the outbreak. “If people begin to cooperate now, Iran will see 120,000 infections and 12,000 deaths before the outbreak is over,” she explained. “If they offer medium cooperation, there will be 300,000 cases and 110,000 deaths.” She warned that, should people fail to follow medical guidance, this could place excessive pressure upon the country’s already strained healthcare system, leading to millions of deaths. “If medical facilities are not sufficient, there will be four million cases, and 3.5 million people will die,” she explained. Many of the country’s Islamic fundamentalists continue to ignore government advice to observe religious practices. On Monday evening, an angry mob stormed the courtyards of Mashhad’s Imam Reza shrine and Qom’s Fatima Masumeh shrine so they could pray and kiss the shrines. This has caused immense concern among health officials, who have pleaded with Iran’s Shiite clergy to close them. Eslami did not elaborate on the details and methods of the study, but making such claims on tightly-controlled Iranian state television marked a significant shift in approach from the Iranian regime, which has repeatedly tried to play down the crisis only for its severity to worsen. Iran has so far recorded over 17,000 cases of the coronavirus, and over 1,100 deaths, making it one of the most badly affected countries in the world.  At least 12 of those deaths have been of Iranian politicians and officials, both sitting and former, while 13 others have been infected and are currently in quarantine and receiving treatment. According to Dr. Rick Brennan, Director of Emergency Operations for the World Health Organization’s Emergencies Program, the number of coronavirus deaths in Iran could be up to five times higher than the official figures as a result of limited testing. On Monday, the regime dismissed satellite photos of mass dug for victims in one of the most heavily affected areas as “fake news.” On Tuesday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a religious ruling banning any “unnecessary” travel throughout the country in the country. However, he insisted earlier this month that the outbreak was “not such a big tragedy” and one that the country can easily overcome by launching a health “jihad.” “The Coronavirus is not such a big tragedy and this country has surmounted graver ones,” he declared. “However, beseeching God, seeking intercession from the Prophet and his Household, and the prayers of the pure youth and pious are very effective in repelling major tragedies.” “I don’t want to say it’s unimportant, but let’s not exaggerate it either. The Coronavirus will affect the country briefly and leave,” he continued. “But the experience it brings, and the actions of the people and the government sectors, are like a public exercise that will remain as an achievement.” Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.  ",Iran Warns Chinese Coronavirus Could Kill Millions After Branding It ‘Not Such a Big Tragedy’,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/18/iran-warns-chinese-coronavirus-could-kill-millions-after-branding-it-not-such-a-big-tragedy/,Breitbart
"The Trump administration’s plan for ‘stage 3’ of economic rescue measures includes two rounds of payments to Americans, each in an aggregate amount of $250 billion. The plan calls for payments to be distributed to individuals on April 6 and May 18, according to a Treasury Department memo obtained by the Washington Post‘s Heather Long. Payment amounts would be tiered according to income, presumably falling for individuals with higher incomes. The plan calls for payments to go to “individual taxpayers,” likely an indication that the government would use tax rolls and the Internal Revenue Service to distribute money and determine which Americans are eligible for which amounts.

Others, including the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, have raised concerns that about the government issuing checks to wealthy individuals who do not need assistance. EVERYBODY SHOULD GET A CHECK In today's @Markets newsletter, I explain why we need the People's TARP, and that means everyone in the country, employed, unemployed, millionaire, billionaire, child, adult, etc should get a check from the government now. https://t.co/e5TYtjIuOw pic.twitter.com/jumuGfaAJ7 — Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) March 18, 2020  On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he opposed extending the payments to people “who earn a million dollars.” The memo also says the payments would be linked to family size, addressing concerns of some pro-family advocates who pointed out a program that paid a flat fee to households or taxpayers would penalize those with large families. The U.S. tax code generally allows taxpayers to set aside more of their income for household support for each dependent family member. The memo also outlines a $300 billion plan to aid small businesses and their employees through a business interruption loan program. These loans would be made by financial institutions and backed by the federal government for amounts up to 100 percent of 6 weeks payroll, capped at $80,000 annual salary per employee. Employers would not be allowed to lower wages under the program. The memo includes $200 billion of aid to businesses thrown into distress by the coronavirus outbreak, with $50 billion set aside for the airline industry. The plan would authorize the Federal Reserve to backstop the money market mutual funds with a guarantee program, a step it undertook during the financial crisis but is arguably barred by post-crisis financial reforms. Money market funds are used by many Americans as an alternative to savings accounts and the fund much of the short term credit used by U.S. businesses and financial institutions. The Fed backstop is meant to prevent a “run on the bank” against these funds, much the way deposit insurance is aimed at discouraging the more traditional bank run of the sort probably familiar to most Americans from the movie It’s a Wonderful Life. ",White House Coronavirus ‘Stage 3’ Rescue Includes $500 Billion in Income Security Payments to Individuals,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/18/white-house-coronavirus-stage-3-rescue-includes-500-billion-in-income-security-payments-to-individuals/,Breitbart

Don't let your friends and family fall for it. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 18, 2020    On Tuesday, Trump defended calling the disease a “Chinese virus,” an illness that originated in Wuhan, China. “I have to call it where it came from, it did come from China, so I think it’s a very accurate term,” he said during a press conference. The president said he began using the term after China attempted to claim the U.S. military was the source of the virus. “Well, China was putting out information which was false, that our military gave this to them, that was false,” Trump said. He denied referring to China in the name would create a “stigma.” “No I don’t think so. I think that saying our military gave it to them creates a stigma,” Trump said.

"The British parliament’s weekly questions-and-answers session with the Prime Minister was sparsely attended Wednesday, as parties told members to stay away from the debating chamber unless their presence was essential. Normally enthusiastically attended by a packed house, the Wednesday convention of parliamentarians from both sides gathering to ask direct questions of the prime minister looked deeply unfamiliar today, as the vast majority of members stayed away. Both the Conservative and Labour whips told their members to stay away from the session unless their names had already been selected to ask a question in advance, and told Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday 11th (above) and Wednesday 18th (below), showing members sitting apart from one another / Parliament.tv Most members who did attend the session, where questions were almost all about the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, sat apart from one another, appearing to obey the government’s own social distancing advice. The closest proximity sitters were the members of the government front bench itself. Responding to a question from Labour leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn, Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to be going to lengths to appear upbeat. He told the house that the government following the best scientific advice was the best path forward. He said the more closely the government was able to do so: ” the better our chances of relieving the burden on the NHS, the more lives we will save, the more suffering we will avoid, and the quicker we will get through it. “And be in no doubt… this is an enormous challenge for this country, but I think the people of this country understand what they need to do to beat it, and they also understand that we will beat it, and we will beat it together.” The presence of Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn was itself against Parliament’s own advice, which has told members and peers over the age of 70 to stay away from the building and work from home. The Palace has also strictly limited public access to Parliament, closing the viewing galleries in which visitors are able to watch proceedings. The dogged determination of Parliament to stay open stands in contrast to the Canadian Parliament, which shut its doors last week, self-suspending to slow the spread of coronavirus. The move came just days after the Canadian prime minister’s wife tested positive for coronavirus.",‘This is An Enormous Challenge For The Country’: Unnecessary Politicians Told to Stay Away From Parliament,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/18/empty-house-unnecessary-politicians-told-to-stay-away-from-parliament/,Breitbart
"A professor at Central Michigan University (CMU) told student members of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) that she is “terrified” of their group, and that she tears down TPUSA posters whenever she sees them as “an act of civil disobedience.” “I’ve known about [TPUSA] longer than you have, so you’re responsible for the organization you are a part of, and I just, I need you to know that,” said CMU professor Sara Moslener to two students involved with the TPUSA group on campus — according to audio obtained by Breitbart News. “We actually had a long conversation in my class about this today, and I take [posters] down when I see them,” the professor added. “Why would you do that?” asked one of the students. “Because I’m terrified of your organization,” replied Moslener.

And I will tell everyone exactly what I told you, okay?” “There’s no reason you should be scared of us, honestly,” said the student. The exchange continues, before the professor eventually falsely claims that TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk got his start as President Donald Trump’s “social media director.” “He actually doesn’t work for him,” explained the student. “That’s how he got started,” insisted Moslener. “He was his social media director.” “No, he wasn’t.” “Yeah, you should check out Wikipedia then,” retorted the professor. A CMU spokesperson told Breitbart News that the school “encourages critical thinking and analytical thinking, particularly in the marketplace of free ideas and expression.” “CMU recognizes that the intellectual growth if its students requires them to be exposed to vigorous debate and differing points of view on a variety of issues,” added the spokesperson. “CMU hereby affirms its commitment to academic freedom and free speech, and its commitment to upholding such freedoms in the face of external and internal actions or decisions which might threaten such freedoms.” Professor Moslener did not respond to Breitbart News’ request for comment or clarification on whether Wikipedia is an acceptable source for students to use on her class assignments.

"Wednesday on ABC’s “The View,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) argued that 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden would “bring back decency and dignity to the White House.” Klobuchar said, “In terms of what they should know about Joe Biden, I think it’s what we saw last night. A true leader, someone who has worked for change his whole life, someone who will have the back of the American people. What is so missing in this White House as you just discussed earlier in the show with the way he’s been handling the discussion on this virus, what’s so missing, the decency, the dignity that Joe Biden will bring back to the White House. he’s someone of great empathy, and I know you know this, Meghan, because Joe Biden was a good friend of your dad’s.” She added, “He’s someone that will go that extra mile. I remember a friend of mine whose husband died, and Joe Biden had come to Minnesota and done an event. When I called to thank him—this is years and years ago —I told him that my friend’s husband, who had helped with the event, had suddenly died. It was of a virus actually leaving three teenage girls. I said, ‘maybe you can drop her a note or something, it might be nice, widowed at such a young age.’ He didn’t do that. He said, ‘I want her cell phone.’ I said, ‘no, you don’t have to do that, Mr. vice president.'” “He said, ‘yes,'” she continued. “He called my friend while she was driving home from work her first day. He made her pull over on the road, the vice president of the United States, and made her write down his cell phone on her hand so she could call him whenever it was hard because he had lost his own family members.

"Health officials in New York City recorded 279 new coronavirus cases just between morning and night on Tuesday, bringing the total to 923 as testing increases and the mayor considers a “shelter in place” order within the next 48 hours in the most populous city in America. As of Tuesday night, there were ten coronavirus-related deaths in New York City, one of the largest cities in the world. NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio reportedly indicated that the total number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the city went from 644 on Tuesday morning to 923 at night time, marking an increase of 279. “BREAKING: [De Blasio] says that the city now 923 cases of [COVID-19], up from 644 THIS MORNING,” Jesse McKinley, the New York Times bureau chief in the capital of New York state, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night. “Also, now 10 deaths in the city”: BREAKING:  @BilldeBlasiosays that the city now 923 cases of #coronavirus, up from 644 THIS MORNING.

NYC, like other cities across the United States, is currently under drastic restrictions and shutdowns. On Tuesday afternoon, Mayor de Blasio warned city residents to prepare for a potential “shelter in place” order within the next 48 hours. “It is definitely a possibility at this point,” the NYC mayor told reporters, acknowledging that such a move would have to be approved by state officials. The New York Times explained: Mr. de Blasio did not elaborate on what such an order would look like in New York City, but a similar directive in California’s Bay Area requires people to stay at home except for essential activities. The mayor said that such an order could limit movement in the city to people with essential jobs like police officers, firefighters, and health care workers. It could also allow people to go outside to exercise, although he noted that Italy had imposed more restrictive measures. Soon after De Blasio briefed reporters, Gov. Cuomo rejected any suggestion that a “shelter in place” order was forthcoming. “Any blanket quarantine or shelter in place policy would require state action, and as the governor has said, there is no consideration of that for any locality at this time,” Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Cuomo, declared in a statement. The World Health Organization (WHO) has deemed the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. As of Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases (confirmed and likely) and 75 deaths across the United States and its territories. The total number of U.S. cases recorded by the CDC more than doubled in just days, from the 1,629 reported on Friday.

"Alabama Governor Kay Ivey on Wednesday announced the state’s much-anticipated U.S. Senate Republican runoff between former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville previously scheduled for March 31 is postponed until July 14. Citing concerns involving the COVID-19 coronavirus threat, Ivey announced she was exercising the authority granted to her based on an opinion released by Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall a day earlier. “Exercising my extraordinary powers under the Emergency Management Act, I am setting Alabama’s Primary Runoff Election for July 14, 2020,” Ivey said in a statement. “The ability to hold free and fair elections is an inherent right as citizens of the United States and the great state of Alabama, but the safety and wellbeing of Alabama citizens is paramount. Our State Health Officer, Dr. Scott Harris, is recommending that we should practice social distancing and refrain from public gatherings of more than 25 individuals. Maintaining a 6-foot distance between one another is paramount. This guidance alone would be making an election day a hotbed for spreading the virus.” “Persons who are 65 years or older as well as those with previous heart and lung diseases are more vulnerable to the Coronavirus,” she added. “Knowing the average age of our faithful poll workers qualifies them to be most at-risk adds the necessity to extend the election runoff date. Delaying the election to July 14 is not a decision I came to lightly, but one of careful consideration. I appreciate the guidance of Attorney General Steve Marshall and Secretary of State John H. Merrill for their collaboration to ensure the continuity of our state government.” Two other key runoff primaries runoff elections in Alabama were also impacted by Ivey’s decision. In Alabama’s first congressional district, Mobile County Commissioner Jerry Carl faces former State Senator Bill Hightower (R) for the GOP nod in a race for the seat Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL) is vacating at the end of his term. In Alabama’s second congressional district, Dothan, AL businessman Jeff Coleman faces former State Representative Barry Moore (R) for the Republican nomination in the seat Rep. Martha Roby (R-AL) is vacating at the end of her term. Sessions commended the decision in a statement. “I know that Governor Ivey has considered the health of Alabamians and that she has focused on their best interests in making her decision,” Sessions said. “The safety and health of Alabamians must take precedence,” he said. “I am confident that Secretary of State John Merrill and Circuit Clerks across the state, in consultation with public health officials, will work hard to ensure a safe and orderly runoff election on July 14th. It is important that every voter’s voice has a fair chance to be heard, whether the vote is cast via an absentee ballot, or at the ballot box on election day. We intend to maintain our vigorous campaign up until the last day, even as we are careful to do so in a manner that puts the health and safety of the public first.” Sessions also took a shot at his opponent Tuberville for his lack of willingness to debate. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump gave Tuberville his endorsement, and Tuberville has been ahead most of the way since the March 3 primary based on polling. Senator Doug Jones (D-AL), the incumbent in the general election that will face either Tuberville or Sessions in November, also applauded Ivey’s call. “Amid this COVID-19 public health emergency, I commend Governor Ivey’s decision to delay the runoff election until July 14th,” Jones said in a statement. “Right now, everyone’s top priority should be to stop the spread of the virus and keep folks safe at home, and that includes allowing Alabamians to vote absentee and vote by mail. It’s crucial that we expand access to the ballot box, enact early voting and expand opportunities to vote by mail in Alabama so that all eligible voters are able to participate in our democracy.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",Alabama Sessions-Tuberville U.S. Senate GOP Runoff Postponed Until July 14,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/alabama-sessions-tuberville-u-s-senate-gop-runoff-postponed-until-july-14/,Breitbart
"Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said in a statement on Wednesday that multinational corporations should explain how they plan to move jobs back to America before asking for bailouts from the federal government. “To any multinational corporations that come to Congress asking for taxpayer $$$, you better come prepared to explain how you will move supply chains and jobs back to America if you want my vote,” Hawley wrote on Wednesday.

Hawley introduced legislation late February that would combat potential drug shortages and help the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gather information regarding potential shortfalls in pharmaceutical companies’ manufacturing capacity. He said in February that the coronavirus outbreak has highlighted America’s vulnerable medical supply chain. Hawley explained: The coronavirus outbreak in China has highlighted severe and longstanding weaknesses in our medical supply chain. This is more than unfortunate; it’s a danger to public health. Our health officials need to know the extent of our reliance on Chinese production so they can take all necessary action to protect Americans. This legislation will give us the information we need to better secure our supply chain and ensure that Americans have uninterrupted access to life-saving drugs and medical devices. Hawley also introduced the Emergency Family Relief Act of 2020 on Tuesday, which would provide families economic relief in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic. He said: Struggling families need help, and they don’t have time to sort through confusing rules and mandates about who’s paying for what and how. They’re not sure what’s going to happen to mom’s or dad’s workplace during this crisis, or if their work can afford to keep everyone on payroll. Let’s not overthink this. These families need relief — now — to pay bills that are coming due, make those emergency grocery runs, and get ready for potential medical bills. “Let’s get it to them,” he said.

"Hundreds of Americans are stuck in Peru after the government shut down the country’s borders (land, air, and maritime) on Monday as part of its strategy to slow the number of coronavirus infections. The United States Embassy in Peru announced on Tuesday the Peruvian Ministry of Health confirmed 117 coronavirus cases, with 13 hospitalized. No deaths have yet been reported. So far, the embassy has not announced plans to help the Americans: American Citizens who remain in Peru should arrange lodging for the duration of the quarantine period and plan to limit their movements.  Limited quarantine exemptions include movement to obtain food and medical care.  Travelers currently in country should consult iPeru for the latest guidance for tourists.  The Embassy will provide a daily update on this page as this situation develops. The Hill reported on some of the Americans stranded in the country: Many Americans have been caught up in the confusion, split between the port city of Lima where the international airport is and the mountain town of Cuzco, which has one airport. A number of Americans stuck in the country say they are having difficulty finding places to sleep. Two Americans tried to organize stranded U.S. travelers by creating a group chat on the messaging service WhatsApp, which has expanded to nearly 300 participants and more people being added. They say they have received little to no communication with the U.S. Embassy in Peru, are distraught over whether they can return to the U.S. and are concerned over whether those with permanent residency status in the U.S. will be able to return.They have organized a spreadsheet with their information, set up a Facebook group and directed chat members to register for the State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.  The Americans are also using Twitter to appeal to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to address their plight.

"Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News in an interview on Tuesday that Democrats exploited the coronavirus package by pushing for bigger government and policies that will hurt small businesses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) pushed forward with Democrats’ coronavirus response package without many of President Donald Trump’s proposals, including a payroll tax holiday. Gohmert said Democrats took advantage of the package to push for paid sick and family leave in the coronavirus package that negatively impacts small businesses. Quoting former Barack Obama Chief of Staff, Gohmert said the Democrats “Never let a crisis go to waste.” The Texas conservative revealed the package crafted by Democrats exempted businesses larger than 500 employees, exposing the Democrats’ corporatist tendencies. He said: We were talking about really ramming the Department of Labor and Treasury through some small businesses’ lives. And so much for the Democrats’ hating big business and big corporations. Because you look at the bill, they exempted business with 500 or more employees. They targeted only businesses that have less than 500 employees. There was a time 12 years ago with Obamacare that they exempted businesses that had less than 50 employees. If they had a turnover over the last decade, they had a turnover with the small businesses and given the big evil corporations a major break. “If you’re a small business, a very small business, it may put you out of business, not to come and work. And so I have a concern for those regular employees who are going to lose their employees and go out of business because they have to pay people who are not coming to work even though they get reimbursed,” he added. “Democrats wanted to go because this is a crisis, and that means more government intervention and took advantage of that chance.” In contrast, Gohmert said Congress should consider Trump’s payroll tax holiday. The Texas congressman said he came up with the idea as an “alternative” to the 2008 financial crisis bailout package. “You could allow people to keep the massive amount of money in their paycheck that they send to Washington every month,” Gohmert said. “They’re going to know what better to do it instead of the bozos in Wall Street that sent us to the brink of ruin.” The spread of the coronavirus throughout China has exposed the deep vulnerabilities in the U.S. medical supply chain as well as the country’s dependence upon China producing pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Axios reported the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized the American supply of roughly 150 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, generics, and brand-name drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market. Gohmert added he recently told President Trump, “Any major nation that cannot produce what they need in a time of war is not going to stay a major nation after the next war.” He added the president understood Gohmert’s argument. “We need to be producing more steel here, we need to have more manufacturing jobs here, and certainly we need to be producing more of the critical medications we need to protect our citizens,” he added. “And we have the capability, and we should be doing it here. We don’t even have to wait on this until the crisis is over. We could be doing that now. I would like to see us push for it.” Gohmert said, “I think we’ll see the brilliance of American ingenuity once again shine through.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Plan for social distancing at least until mid-or late May, and be thankful if it eases off earlier.” The article also notes there would likely be four different rounds of social distancing throughout the year to prevent the virus from spreading.

On Tuesday, he praised health care workers for their efforts. “We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our health professionals and everybody who’ll be on the front lines of this pandemic for a long while,” he said. “They’re giving everything.

"ROME — Pope Francis has urged people not to “waste” the opportunities for growth presented by this period of trial, recommending families to rediscover the affection that binds them together. “During these difficult days we can find small, concrete gestures expressing closeness and concreteness towards the people closest to us, a caress for our grandparents, a kiss for our children, for the people we love,” the pope said during an interview published Wednesday in La Repubblica. “These are important, decisive gestures. If we live these days like this, they won’t be wasted.” The pontiff suggested that the period of isolation that many are experiencing because of the coronavirus can serve to bring people closer together, replacing “virtual communication” with the real thing. “In their homes, families often eat together in great silence, but not as a result of listening to each other, but because the parents watch television while they eat, and children are on their mobile phones,” Francis said. “They look like monks, all isolated from each other. Here there is no communication, whereas listening to each other is important because that’s how we can understand the needs, efforts, desires of the other. “This language made of concrete gestures must be safeguarded. In my opinion, the pain of these days should open us up to this concreteness,” he added. The pope also revealed what he prayed for when earlier this week he traveled across Rome to the churches of Santa Maria Maggiore and San Marcello al Corso. “I asked the Lord to stop the epidemic: Lord, stop it with your hand. That’s what I prayed for,” he said. The key to living these days well, Francis said, is to “understand that in small things lies our treasure.” “These gestures of tenderness, affection, compassion, are minimal and tend to be lost in the anonymity of everyday life, but they are nonetheless decisive, important,” he said. “For example, a hot meal, a caress, a hug, a phone call… They are familiar gestures of attention to the details of everyday life that make life meaningful and that create communion and communication among us.” “We must rediscover the concreteness of little things, small gestures of attention we can offer those close to us, our family, our friends,” he said. The pope also had words of encouragement for nonbelievers, insisting that they can find hope in the love of those around them, even if they do not believe in God. “They are all God’s children and are looked upon by Him,” Francis said. “Even those who have not yet met God, those who do not have the gift of faith, can find their way through this, in the good things they believe in: they can find strength in love for their children, for their family, for their brothers and sisters.” “One can say: ‘I cannot pray because I do not believe.’ But at the same time, he can believe in the love of the people around him, and thus find hope,” he said.

"Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite who allegedly operated as Jeffrey Epstein’s “madam” in procuring underage girls for sexual predation, has filed a civil lawsuit against the deceased criminal’s estate, seeking the recoupment of her mounting legal bills. Maxwell, who is reportedly under federal investigation for her alleged role in Epstein’s child sex trafficking activities, alleges that the once-high flying investor made “clear and unambiguous” promises to provide her with financial assistance, read court filings in the United States Virgin Islands. “Maxwell reasonably and justifiably relied on Epstein’s promises and put her trust in Epstein that he would fulfill his promises,” reads the lawsuit the filed in Superior Court in St. Thomas last week. Maxwell’s U.S. Virgin Islands-based attorney, Kyle Waldner, did not reply to a request for comment for ABC News and other media outlets. Since Epstein’s death on August 10, Maxwell’s whereabouts are still currently unknown. Over the summer, Maxwell’s friend and lawyer, Leah Saffian, reportedly staged a photo of her eating at In-n-Out burger while reading The Book of Honor: The Secret Lives and Deaths of CIA Operatives.

The In-N-Out burger joint picture was published by the New York Post on Thursday after they obtained it from Saffian, 60.” Other reports have claimed that Maxwell is in France living and living with businessman Scott Borgerson in Massachusetts; however, he has told reporters that the claim is false.

"The Trump administration’s plan for ‘stage 3’ of economic rescue measures includes two rounds of payments to Americans, each in an aggregate amount of $250 billion. The plan calls for payments to be distributed to individuals on April 6 and May 18, according to a Treasury Department memo obtained by the Washington Post‘s Heather Long. Payment amounts would be tiered according to income, presumably falling for individuals with higher incomes. The plan calls for payments to go to “individual taxpayers,” likely an indication that the government would use tax rolls and the Internal Revenue Service to distribute money and determine which Americans are eligible for which amounts.

Others, including the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, have raised concerns about the government issuing checks to wealthy individuals who do not need assistance. EVERYBODY SHOULD GET A CHECK In today's @Markets newsletter, I explain why we need the People's TARP, and that means everyone in the country, employed, unemployed, millionaire, billionaire, child, adult, etc should get a check from the government now. https://t.co/e5TYtjIuOw pic.twitter.com/jumuGfaAJ7 — Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) March 18, 2020  On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he opposed extending the payments to people “who earn a million dollars.” The memo also says the payments would be linked to family size, addressing concerns of some pro-family advocates who pointed out a program that paid a flat fee to households or taxpayers would penalize those with large families. The U.S. tax code generally allows taxpayers to set aside more of their income for household support for each dependent family member. The memo also outlines a $300 billion plan to aid small businesses and their employees through a business interruption loan program. These loans would be made by financial institutions and backed by the federal government for amounts up to 100 percent of 6 weeks payroll, capped at $80,000 annual salary per employee. Employers would not be allowed to lower wages under the program. The memo includes $200 billion of aid to businesses thrown into distress by the coronavirus outbreak, with $50 billion set aside for the airline industry. The plan would authorize the Federal Reserve to backstop the money market mutual funds with a guarantee program, a step it undertook during the financial crisis but is arguably barred by post-crisis financial reforms. Money market funds are used by many Americans as an alternative to savings accounts and the fund much of the short term credit used by U.S. businesses and financial institutions. The Fed backstop is meant to prevent a “run on the bank” against these funds, much the way deposit insurance is aimed at discouraging the more traditional bank run of the sort probably familiar to most Americans from the movie It’s a Wonderful Life. ",White House Coronavirus ‘Stage 3’ Rescue Includes $500 Billion in Income Security Payments to Individuals,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/18/white-house-coronavirus-stage-3-rescue-includes-500-billion-in-income-security-payments-to-individuals/,Breitbart
"Hordes of young people defied orders to practice social distancing as coronavirus concerns steadily increase, congregating on South Florida beaches Tuesday despite official calls to limit social events to groups of ten. The phenomenon speaks to the growing generational tension between younger Americans — who as President Trump said, may feel “invincible” in this time of crisis — and older Americans who remain at a higher risk. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Tuesday the mass closure of bars and nightclubs as the coronavirus pandemic festers in the United States and in the state of Florida. He did not provide a stringent order for beaches in the Sunshine State, but said the statewide position is in accordance with the CDC guidance of “no group on a beach more than ten.” “You have to have distance apart if you’re going to be out there,” DeSantis said during Tuesday’s press conference. “So that will apply statewide.” The governor noted that local officials could take more aggressive action depending on the situations in their respective communities. Officials in the Miami area, for example, have taken more aggressive action, with Miami Beach imposing a curfew on popular blocks of South Beach and shutting down public beaches “from Fifth through 15th streets — including Lummus Park” in South Beach. According to the Miami Herald: In Miami Beach, the emergency measures will run through at least March 19, but City Manager Jimmy Morales — who invoked his emergency powers on Thursday through a declaration of state of emergency — will ask the City Commission to extend them. … The directives expand the scope of an emergency measure Morales ordered Saturday to close three blocks of beach in South Beach early beginning at 4:30 p.m. On Friday, Morales issued his first emergency order requiring the city’s most popular restaurants and clubs to limit their capacity to under 250 people. Fort Lauderdale has also prohibited gatherings of more than 250 people. “The status quo with crowds of spring breakers is absolutely unacceptable,” Miami Beach Commissioner Mark Samuelian said in a statement. “Every health expert is telling us we need social distancing — less interaction to reduce transmissions.” “While I empathize with our businesses and their employees, I fully support the City Manager’s additional emergency measures to enhance public safety,” he added. Despite best efforts from officials, younger people have continued to flock to South Florida beaches, seemingly ignoring the calls to practice social distancing. That practice, officials say, could curb the impact of the virus on vulnerable Americans — older generations and those with underlying health issues. Nevertheless, photos show dozens, if not hundreds, of spring breakers on Miami’s South Beach reveling in their youth on St. Patrick’s Day, twerking, wrestling, and partying, despite the Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber previously deeming spring break effectively “over.” “We can’t have the kinds of crowds we’ve had, the kinds of gatherings,” Gelber said during a news conference on Sunday. “I walked down Ocean Drive yesterday and what I saw was incredibly disturbing, it wasn’t just the typical large gatherings of people, but it was young people who believe they’re invincible and probably don’t really think of this in any way as a health crisis,” he added. Local 10 reported a similar phenomenon last week, noting that crowds on Hollywood Beach “were out in full force despite coronavirus concerns.” The refusal to heed to the warnings of public health officials is furthering the generational divide across the board. None summed up the harsh reality better than actress Vanessa Hudges, who came under fire after telling her 38 million Instagram followers that extreme social distancing measures are “bullshit” because “like, yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible, but like, inevitable?” She has since apologized for her “insensitive” words. Nonetheless, President Trump said on Wednesday that younger generations need to “heed the advice” of officials. “We don’t want them gathering, and I see they do gather —  including on beaches and including in restaurants — young people. They don’t realize — they’re feeling invincible,” Trump said during a Wednesday press conference. “They were feeling totally invincible or are feeling that way but they don’t realize they can be carrying lots of bad things home to grandmother and grandfather and even their parents,” he continued. “So we want them to heed the advice. We made the advice and I think it’s getting through. I do believe it’s getting through,” he added.

"Former Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton called on Congress to “make voting by mail the norm” with “free postage” as a result of public health concerns due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he expects the current national emergency to last through July or August. The White House has not yet said what, if any, preparations might be needed for the November election. Clinton’s call echoed a similar demand by Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D), who asked legislators to allow all-mail voting this year. Republicans are skeptical, recalling the infamous words of President-elect Barack Obama’s incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, in 2008: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” We wholeheartedly agree, @SecretaryHobbs, and we already have a bill by @seanbowie that would do just that. Let's work with @FannKfann to send it straight to the floor and fast track this important legislation. Read the bill here: https://t.co/KMOcluzpEK — Arizona Senate Dems (@AZSenateDems) March 18, 2020  Several states already allow voting by mail, though Republicans have warned that California’s system is vulnerable to fraud. There, Democrats legalized a system called “ballot harvesting,” which allows unverified third parties to deliver each other’s ballots — effectively allowing party organizers to bring thousands of ballots to be counted. Republicans blamed some of their 2018 losses in California on “ballot harvesting.” And Republican efforts to copy Democrats’ tactics have failed because Republicans are generally more reluctant to give their ballots to others. Clinton is familiar with the value of voting by mail: she was thought to be running neck-and-neck with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in California in the 2016 presidential primary, but then she won by several points — largely because she had stronger turnout in mail-in ballots. Mail-in ballots also helped her run up popular vote margins in 2016. Joel B.

"President Trump confirmed on Wednesday that migrants arriving at the United States-Mexico border will be turned back to Mexico to stave off additional coronavirus outbreaks. During a White House press briefing, Trump said he would be invoking 42 U.S. Code § 265, which allows the federal government to suspend entry of foreign nationals over risks of spreading a communicable disease. “On asylum seekers and people who cross the southern border illegally, are you planning to invoke 42 USC 265 which would allow you to prohibit entry of certain people across the border?” a reporter asked Trump. “The answer is yes,” Trump said. When asked when the order would take effect, Trump said, “Very soon, probably today.” The stopping of migrant traffic at the southern border is likely to mimic Trump’s newly announced shutdown of the U.S.-Canada border. The order does not equate to a closing of the southern border, as Trump noted, because essential traffic will continue. The same carve-out has been made for the northern border entry suspension. As Breitbart News reported, nearly 151,000 border crossers and illegal aliens have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border since October 2019 from 72 affected countries. Since then, 1,657 Chinese nationals have been apprehended at the southern border. About 341 of these Chinese nationals sought to enter the U.S. illegally just within the last few months. At the U.S.-Canada border, nearly 10,400 foreign nationals were deemed inadmissible or apprehended in January and February. In January, alone, northern border agents encountered nearly 3,600 foreign nationals. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday commented on the newest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed by President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force.

"The Michigan Department of Attorney General issued a “cease and desist” letter on Tuesday to the home improvement chain Menards after the attorney general claimed the company was “price gouging” face masks, cleaning products, and other items related to the coronavirus pandemic. Far-left Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office alleges Menards sold bleach at double the price, and two-packs of face masks for $39.95 with a $20 rebate. “In the context of the media stories about the mounting public health threat caused by Coronavirus, Menards’ pricing actions this past week serve only to fuel anxiety and promote hoarding,” Assistant Attorneys General Darrin Fowler and Andrea Moua wrote. Kelly Rossman-McKinney, communications director for the attorney general, told Breitbart News that the office has received 500 complaints statewide of price gouging. Only 18 of them have been lodged by Menards shoppers. Menards owner John Menard Jr. has been a regular financial supporter of Republican politicians. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported in 2015: Billionaire John Menard Jr. gave more than $1.5. million to the Wisconsin Club for Growth in an effort to boost Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign in the 2012 recall, Yahoo News reported. Citing anonymous sources, Yahoo reported that Menard backed the Wisconsin governor and likely 2016 presidential candidate by making more than $1.5 million in donations to Club for Growth, which doesn’t disclose its donors. Club for Growth spent heavily to defend Walker in his successful recall election. According to Open Secrets, Menards has given more to Republicans than Democrats each campaign cycle, with the exception of 2020 to date. Rossman-McKinney denied a political motivation to target Menards. “COVID-19 isn’t partisan. Consumers are from all parties, and whether or not Mr. Menard contributes to anyone or any party has absolutely no impact on our decision to go after his store for price gouging,” she told Breitbart News. Nessel is taking action after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) issued an executive order banning stores from raising prices on items more than 20 percent from what they were on March 9, 2020. “Big box stores are not immune to the Michigan Consumer Protection Act or the Governor’s Executive Order,” Nessel said in a press release. “Large corporations must also play by the rules, and my office will work diligently to ensure this state’s consumers are treated fairly and not abused by businesses seeking to unlawfully jack prices up to line their pockets with profits at the expense of the public during this time of great need.” Menards has ten days to respond to the attorney general’s demands, or Nessel will potentially take legal action, according to Moody on the Market.

"Detroit (AP) — Ford and General Motors are confirming that they will temporarily close all of their North American factories due to the coronavirus threat. Fiat Chrysler will do the same, according to two people briefed on the matter Wednesday. Ford said its plants will shut down after Thursday evening shifts, through March 30, while GM said it will begin a “systematic orderly suspension” of production through at least March 30. Operations will be evaluated weekly after that. Messages were left seeking comment from Fiat Chrysler. The people speaking about the closures didn’t want to be identified because formal announcements had not yet been made. “We have been taking extraordinary precautions around the world to keep our plant environments safe, and recent developments in North America make it clear this is the right thing to do now,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. Ford said in its statement that it will work with leaders of the United Auto Workers union in the coming weeks on plans to restart factories, as well as exploring more procedures to prevent the virus from spreading. The union has been pushing for factories to close because workers are fearful of coming into contact with the virus. The companies’ decisions reverse a deal worked out late Tuesday in which the automakers would cancel some shifts so they could thoroughly cleanse equipment and buildings, but keep factories open. But workers, especially at some Fiat Chrysler factories, were still fearful and were pressuring the union to seek full closures. Fiat Chrysler temporarily closed a factory in Sterling Heights, Michigan, north of Detroit, after workers were concerned about the virus. The company said a plant worker tested positive for the coronavirus but had not been to work in over a week. One shift was sent home Tuesday night and the plant was cleaned. But that apparently didn’t satisfy workers, and two more shifts were canceled on Wednesday. Ford said it closed an assembly plant in the Detroit suburb of Wayne, Michigan, on Wednesday after a worker there tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The company said it is thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the building. Production will be halted through March 30, the company said. Honda Motor Co. announced Wednesday morning that it will temporarily close its North American factories for about one week starting on Monday, and that put additional pressure on Detroit automakers. The move by General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford will idle about 150,000 auto workers. They likely will receive supplemental pay in addition to state unemployment benefits. The two checks combined will about equal what the workers normally make. Automakers have resisted closing factories largely because they book revenue when vehicles are shipped from factories to dealerships. So without production, revenue dries up. Each company has other reasons to stay open as well. Ford, for instance, is building up F-150 pickup inventory because its plants will have to go out of service later this year to be retooled for an all-new model. Despite the plant closures by other automakers, electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc.’s assembly plant in Fremont, California, remained open Wednesday. Production continued even though Alameda County on Tuesday night declared it a “nonessential business” under the county’s shelter-in-place order. Seven Bay Area counties have ordered nearly 7 million residents to shelter in place for three weeks and ordered businesses to send employees home in order to slow spread of the coronavirus. Businesses that can remain open include pharmacies, banks and supermarkets — but not electric car manufacturing. In an email to employees, Tesla Human Resources said the company does not have final word from city, county, state and federal governments on whether the plant can operate. Tesla has conflicting guidance from different levels of government, the email said. The note said production workers should still report for work unless they aren’t feeling well. If that’s the case, they should use paid time off. The email said there would be further communication Wednesday night.","Coronavirus: Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler Shutting Down U.S. Factories",2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/18/coronavirus-ford-gm-fiat-chrysler-shutting-down-u-s-factories/,Breitbart

"Maria Ryan, CEO of Cottage Hospital in Woodsville, New Hampshire, told Breitbart News that her biggest concern during the coronavirus outbreak is loss of staff due to actual or suspected coronavirus infection. She joined Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin to discuss the state of affairs at her rural hospital in addressing the viral spread. Mansour asked, “Bottom line, do you feel prepared? Do you have everything that you need? Do you need anything else from the federal government that you’re not getting?” Ryan shared her fear of temporarily losing staff to real or suspected coronavirus infection during a period of increased demand on her hospital’s services.  “I don’t feel that way, like I need anything more except workforce, right?” replied Ryan. “If I get a sick workforce, then like any hospital, especially in a rural area, that’s what’s going to strap me, if the workforce starts to get sick.” LISTEN:
 “We’re already in a workforce shortage,” added Ryan. “We have one of the lowest unemployment rates. We border Vermont, [which] has an even lower unemployment rate. We don’t have enough people for the jobs, so we’re all strapped for healthcare personnel to begin with.” Ryan explained, “If we start getting sick with people, or even if they have a common cold, but we suspect [or are] concerned they may have coronavirus, they have to go home for 14 days. So that is a valid concern of all of [ours], our workforce.”  Ryan’s hospital serves 26 towns in New Hampshire and Vermont. The towns “are really economically depressed, and it’s an older population,” Ryan said. Ryan noted the impact of the conventional flu — influenza A and B viruses, primarily — across America during the 2019-2020 flu season, beginning October 1. “In the United States, it’s considered a moderate season,” said Ryan of the most recent flu season. “We’ve had about 36 million flu illnesses [and] 370,000 hospitalizations throughout the United States, and 22,000 deaths — unfortunately, 144 were children — and this is not even done, yet. We’re still in high flu season, and this is considered moderate. A high season, [such as ] in 2017 to 2018, we’ve had 79,000 deaths.” The swine flu outbreak of 2009 and 2010 provided hospitals with experience in dealing with pandemics, remarked Ryan, praising President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Ryan recalled, “The 2009 pandemic with the swine flu [was] another novel virus. It was an H1N1 family, but a new virus we hadn’t studied, yet, and we hadn’t seen. That was really devastating. A couple of things happened in 2009 that made me prepare for today. One, there was a delayed response in the national emergency [declaration]. I’m not blaming anybody. It was new. We have certainly learned from that time.” Ryan continued, “Look at how quickly President Trump had declared a national emergency and that freed up to do an awful lot of stuff, and waive some of the burdensome regulations so we can take care of patients, and he also — which was very bold — he stopped travel in from China and then subsequently from Europe which helped slow the transmission.” “But in 2009, it was really devastating how much the [swine] flue hit the United States,” Ryan added, “We learned something about that because it was so devastating, and we had so many deaths related to it. We had, globally, anywhere from 151,000 people up to 575,000 people, and it hit children and young adults, which was very different than the typical flu season.” About 60 million Americans were infected with swine flu, remembered Ryan, noting that about 12,000 American died of the virus. The economic impact of coronavirus-related closures of businesses worried Ryan. “Here’s my fear with hospitals — I’m not actually afraid that we are not prepared to handle really critically ill people, I’m not even afraid of that — I’m afraid that economically, some of us are going to die,” Ryan said. “We have all these edicts now, [such as] don’t have people come to your clinics unless they’re really critically ill, but if it’s just for a physical, don’t have them come in, [and] elective surgeries are all being canceled.” Ryan asked, “Economically, how are we going to survive? We’re the economic engine for rural America. Hospitals employ more people and we contribute to the economics of really depressed areas, and I employ 300 people. Every year, I’ve been able to create jobs, and now I’m walking through my hospital — it’s a ghost town — but we have to comply with all the recommendations or guidelines, because God forbid somebody does get sick — people get sick all the time and they have flues, but people would say, ‘Oh, you didn’t follow the guidelines.'” “So that’s what I worry about,” concluded Ryan.

"While speaking on MSNBC on Wednesday, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel stated that China feels they are being scapegoated by people calling the coronavirus the Wuhan flu, Wuhan virus, or China virus. And that the virus “came from the territory of China, but came from bats. This is a bat virus, not a China virus.” Engel said, “It is easy to scapegoat people. And that is what has always happened when there have been pandemics or epidemics, that foreigners are attacked, foreigners sometimes physically attacked. If you look at what happened during the Middle Ages. There was lots and lots of scapegoating against an ethnic group or a religious group whenever there were pandemics that effected the society and frightened a lot of people. And China certainly feels that is what is happening now with people calling it the Wuhan flu or the Wuhan virus or the China virus. This is a virus that came from the territory of China, but came from bats. This is a bat virus, not a China virus. It doesn’t speak Chinese. It doesn’t target Chinese people.

"Chinese media outlets import numerous journalists into the United States via the H-1B program, usually at very low salaries. The imported visa-workers’ wages are as low as $33,000 per year – despite the large number of Americans seeking journalist careers – according to federal data collected by MyVisaJobs.com. MyVisaJobs.com uses federal data to track job opportunities for foreign graduates in the United States. The data shows that employers nationwide nominated 11,153 Chinese-born migrants for green cards in 2019; 12,612 in 2018; 8,603 in 2017; and 7,217 in 2016. Overall, 59,870 Chinese has been nominated for green cards since 2010 by U.S. employers. Nearly all of those requests are approved by the government, after a short delay. On March 17, Chinese media outlets announced that China’s government is pushing roughly 13 U.S. journalists out of China: China demands that journalists of US citizenship working with the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020 notify the Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within four calendar days starting from today and hand back their press cards within ten calendar days. They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People’s Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions. On March 18, China made more threats against American journalists, Reuters reported: Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also warned that China would be compelled to take further action against American media and journalists in China if the United States did not “correct its mistakes”. “The U.S. has said that all options are on the table. Today, I can also tell the U.S. that all options are on the table for China,” Geng told a regular daily press briefing. “The expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it ‘deplores’ China’s decision,” Reuters reported. The MyVisaJobs data shows the many requests for H-1B workers in 2019, 2018, and 2017 by China-run outlets, as well as by U.S. media companies that hire Chinese workers: Some of the media outlets are privately owned – even though they import journalists from China. Huopai Media Inc. sought ten H-1Bs, at wages from $48,000 to $52,500. The company has apparently been threatened by the Chinese government, according to the Washington Post. “China’s transnational operation to suppress free speech and influence international public opinion is equally significant, extending to Chinese American communities as well as to the mainstream U.S. media,” the Post reported. Sing Tao Newspapers New York asked for 25 H-1Bs, at an average wage of $36,000. The company is an affiliate of a Hong Kong newspaper.

These workers must first get a technology-related degree from a U.S. university and can work for up to three years, even if they are paid very low wages. In 2018, almost 480,000 Chinese students were registered in the United States. Also, 25,843 Chinese graduates got work-permits via the ‘STEM’ side of the Optional Training Program. Many American outlets and trade associations import foreigners to work as journalists in the United States. Bloomberg, for example, asked for 14 journalists since 2017, plus several hundred software experts. Marketing agencies and advertising firms also hired many foreigners instead of Americans. Each year, roughly 40 percent of the requests for H-1Bs are approved by the federal government. Once imported, the H-1B workers can stay for roughly six years. However, U.S. companies can sponsor their foreign H-1B employees for green cards. There is no limit to the number of foreign employees who can be nominated each year. Once nominated the employees can continue extending their work permits. This extension rule has created a domestic workforce of roughly 350,000 Indian computer-workers who have been imported by many American companies.

"Wednesday on “MSNBC Live,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio lamented that there is U.S. Military at the country’s southern border with Mexico building a wall during the coronavirus pandemic. de Blasio said the United States needs the military’s “medical resources,” ‘their logistical know-how” and their help ensuring “food and medicine moves around this country.” “If the federal government does not get involved quickly, and specifically the United States Military –and I spoke to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff yesterday, the military has an extraordinary medical capacity, it’s needed in places like New York right now,” the mayor stated. “But it’s quite clear that the administration in Washington has not mobilized the American military. There are American military officers right now still building a wall at the southern border when all they should be doing domestically is addressing coronavirus. We need their medical resources, their logistical know-how, we need them to help ensure that food and medicine moves around this country and our supply chain is not disrupted.

"Joe Biden continues to lead just a few minutes behind. The former vice president issued a demand on Wednesday that President Trump invoke the Defense Production Act related to coronavirus recovery products. Biden’s plan says to “prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis — such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate — by invoking the Defense Production Action.” biden sends out a statement demanding trump invoke the Defense Production Act minutes after trump…invokes the Defense Production Act pic.twitter.com/D2R0EnoBVg — Joe Gabriel Simonson (@SaysSimonson) March 18, 2020  “This action must be built on forecasted demand, using the best modeling currently available for negative scenarios,” he wrote. But just minutes prior, Trump did just that. The Hill reported: President Trump announced Wednesday he will invoke the Defense Production Act, which would allow the administration to force American industry to ramp up production of medical supplies that are in short supply in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. “It can do a lot of good things if we need it,” Trump said during a White House press conference. Just days ago, Biden seemed to borrow heavily from Trump’s plan to combat the Chinese virus. Breitbart News’s Haris Alic reported March 12: Many of the proposals Biden suggested for combatting the virus were, in fact, already central to the Trump administration’s efforts. For instance, Biden’s plan calls for “no efforts” to be spared in getting private laboratories and universities to help test for the virus. The suggestion mirrors a move the Trump administration took in February in ordering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow hundreds of academic hospitals and private laboratories to start testing for the coronavirus. Similarly, the former vice president’s plan argues in favor of a federal relief effort for small businesses negatively impacted by the pandemic. The idea is identical to one Trump, himself, proposed on Wednesday, while addressing the nation in primetime. Trump’s version, which has been presented to Congress in the form of a $50 billion appropriation for low-interest loans to small businesses, includes detailed requirements for cost, eligibility, and implementation. Biden’s proposal, on the other hand, is vague in terms of cost, only stating the former vice president would push for the creation of a small-business loan program upon taking office.

"The Prime Minister and the Education secretary have announced that all schools in England will be closed from Friday, but the children of ‘key workers’ including doctors and nurses will still be expected to attend. Education secretary Gavin Williamson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that “after schools shut their gates on Friday afternoon, they will remain closed until further notice.” Sixth form colleges, early years providers, further education providers, private schools, and boarding schools are expected to do the same. This will be for “all children” except for those who are “most vulnerable” and the children of “key workers” such as NHS staff, police, and delivery drivers who need to be able to go to work. Vulnerable children are those who have a social worker and have educational and health and care plans. “I said before that if the science and advice changed, such that keeping schools open would no longer be in the best interest of children and teachers, that we would act. We are now at that stage,” Mr Williamson said. “The spike of the virus is increasing at a faster pace than anticipated and it is crucial that we consider the right measures to arrest that increase and to relieve the pressure on the health system,” he added. The minister said that he is working with Her Majesty’s Treasury on the financial support required. Provisions will also be available for children eligible for free school meals. Immediately after Mr Williamson addressed the House of Commons, the Prime Minister spoke to the nation in his daily coronavirus briefing. Explaining some of the specifics of the school shutdown, Mr Johnson said that while the government’s previous stance that schools should stay open may have seen “counter-intuitive”, it was right at the time but now the spread of coronavirus in the UK was entering a new phase of infection, the advice form scientific experts had changed. He said: …we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time, and to follow the best scientific advice. We come today to the key issue of schools where have been consistently advised that there is an important tradeoff. And so far the judgement of our advisors has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic, and that is partly because, counter-intuitively, schools are very safe environments, and in this disease children and young people are much less vulnerable. And hitherto, the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce pressure on the NHS and on all other public services… I have always been clear this is a balanced judgement and one we have kept under constant review. The prime minister echoed Williamson’s earlier comments and said state schools would continue to function until Friday afternoon, at which point they would close to almost all pupils “until further notice”. He said the government would be urging private schools and nurseries to do the same, adding that financial support would be provided to these independent organisations. Of crucial importance, however, was allowing key workers to stay at their jobs, so their children would still be expected to attend school during the shutdown. Those key workers needed to keep the government’s coronavirus response working include National Health Service (NHS, the UK’s state healthcare provider) staff, food delivery drivers, police officers, and care workers, the Prime Minister said. School exams due to take place in the spring will also be cancelled, the PM said, while remarking that pupils will still get the qualifications they “deserve and need”. While no clarification was givne in this point, that could mean exams postponed until the pandemic recedes, or school GCSE certificates given based on previous performance. Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales had already announced schools closures earlier today. Other European countries, including the UK’s closest EU neighbour the Republic of Ireland, have also closed schools to prevent the spread of the Chinese virus.",UK Closes All Schools From Friday to Slow Spread of Coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/18/education-minister-announces-schools-closure-friday/,Breitbart
"Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD) said on Tuesday that there is a “high level of interest” among Republicans for a Donald Trump administration proposal to send Americans payments to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. “I think there is a high level of interest among our members in that idea and seems it might be an area where there’s some common ground with Democrats as well,” Thune said after a Senate Republican lunch on Tuesday. The Trump administration proposed on Wednesday to send Americans up to $1,000 checks in April and May as direct economic support to respond to the economic slowdown that followed the coronavirus epidemic. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who proposed a similar economic relief package this week, said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told senators that the Trump administration “could stand that up pretty quickly … and get pretty significant relief out there pretty fast.” Hawley said that compared to the House Democrats’ coronavirus package, Americans need a simpler solution to provide them economic relief. He outlined in a statement on Tuesday: Struggling families need help, and they don’t have time to sort through confusing rules and mandates about who’s paying for what and how. They’re not sure what’s going to happen to mom’s or dad’s workplace during this crisis, or if their work can afford to keep everyone on payroll. Let’s not overthink this. These families need relief — now — to pay bills that are coming due, make those emergency grocery runs, and get ready for potential medical bills. Let’s get it to them.

"Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner asked the city’s police department to cut back on arrests for low-level and non-violent crime. WHYY reported that Krasner said each arrest causes greater risk of the spread of coronavirus at police substations, in court rooms, and in detention facilities. Krasner said, “We want to make sure the police are safe and don’t have prolonged contact with people that have the virus. Taking one person back to the police station risks everyone at the station. They go into custody, they endanger other inmates in that great cruise ship that is a jail. And then they go to court.” He has asked Philadelphia police commissioner Danielle Outlaw to focus police officers on “serious offenses” only, for a time. NBC Philadelphia reported that Outlaw is willing to delay arrests for certain low-level crimes, but makes clear she is “not turning a blind eye to crime.” This means the arrest for nonviolent offenses will still be made, but at a later date. Outlaw stressed that officers still have the discretion to make an immediate arrest, if so needed. She said, “An officer still has the authority to utilize discretion, and take an offender into physical custody for immediate processing, if the officer and supervisor believe the individual poses a threat to public safety.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Sure this Coronavirus pandemic is a misery but I’m much more optimistic than most at the moment. Here’s one of the reasons: there’s an effective treatment already and it’s available and cheap, according to studies. Chloroquine phosphate, an old-fashioned anti-malarial drug, has shown strong results against COVID-19 infections in South Korea and China. As Anthony Watts notes here there have been at least three studies demonstrating its efficacy against the Coronavirus. Here is one, by James M Todaro and Gregory J Rigano, in association with Stanford University School of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Researchers. According to the summary: Recent guidelines from South Korea and China report that chloroquine is an effective antiviral therapeutic treatment against Coronavirus Disease 2019.  Use of chloroquine (tablets) is showing favorable outcomes in humans infected with Coronavirus including faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay.  US CDC research shows that chloroquine also has strong potential as a prophylactic (preventative) measure against coronavirus in the lab, while we wait for a vaccine to be developed.  Chloroquine is an inexpensive, globally available drug that has been in widespread human use since 1945 against malaria, autoimmune and various other conditions. It concludes: Chloroquine can both prevent and treat malaria.  Chloroquine can both prevent and treat coronavirus in primate cells (Figure 1 and Figure 2).  According to South Korean and China human treatment guidelines, chloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.  Given chloroquine’s human safety profile and existence, it can be implemented today in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world.  Medical doctors may be reluctant to prescribe chloroquine to treat COVID-19 since it is not FDA approved for this use.  The United States of America and other countries should immediately authorize and indemnify medical doctors for prescribing chloroquine to treat COVID-19.  We must explore whether chloroquine can safely serve as a preventative measure prior to infection of COVID-19 to stop further spread of this highly contagious virus. Here is the second study by Jianjun Gao, Zhenxue Tian, Xu Yang Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future. Here is the third, in the journal Nature. It’s titled ‘Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro’ Extract: Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug.8,9 Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV.10Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1c, d). Besides its antiviral activity, chloroquine has an immune-modulating activity, which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. Chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body, including lung, after oral administration. The EC90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 6.90 μM, which can be clinically achievable as demonstrated in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500 mg administration.11Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV. What does this mean? Essentially it means the end of the nightmare is – or ought to be – much closer than we think. It will take many, many months before a vaccine is available for COVID-19. In the meantime, this is a very effective stop-gap solution. Not only does it make those critically affected by the virus less likely to die; but it also acts as a prophylactic – that is, it is capable of stopping people from getting the disease in the first place. The reason that Chloroquine works, I understand from an expert in viral pandemics, is that enables the body to absorb more zinc. Zinc appears to be the most effective agent in disrupting the virus and preventing the ‘cytokine storm’, which is the deadly phase in which the virus tricks the body’s immune system into attacking its own healthy tissue, with often fatal consequences. Why isn’t there more excitement about this readily available treatment? One possible reason is that chloroquine is a generic drug to which no pharmaceutical company owns the patent. Big Pharma’s money and lobbying power will strive to persuade governments – and markets – that the only viable solution to the coronavirus is a vaccine. But in the short term this simply isn’t true. Nor is it clear to me that the global economy is going to survive on lockdown for as long as it takes to develop and test that vaccine – which may not even prove effective in any case. Note that point in the Todaro and Rigano paper about the need for FDA approval. There is no time to waste.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) this week released his own plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic, which includes $2,000 monthly paychecks to “every person in America,” the halt of student loan payments, and the expansion of unemployment insurance. While Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir said the presidential hopeful will be assessing his campaign after Joe Biden’s (D) sweep on Tuesday, he emphasized that Sanders will be focusing keenly on the coronavirus response in the “immediate term.” It is something he has already been doing over the past week, providing near-daily updates on the administration’s continuing response to the virus. Sanders released a formal list of proposals he wants to see implemented to combat the crisis. Some of the ideas, such as issuing paychecks to Americans, have already been championed by President Trump. His administration released its economic proposal to address the ramifications of the coronavirus on Wednesday, which includes “two rounds of payments to Americans, each in an aggregate amount of $250 billion.” On the economic front, Sanders states that workers must remain on payroll and called for the government to “work with affected businesses to provide direct payroll costs for small and medium sized businesses to keep workers employed until this crisis has passed.” He is also calling for emergency $2,000 cash payments “to every person in America every month for the duration of the crisis” and the expansion of unemployment insurance. According to his plan, “everyone who loses a job must qualify for unemployment compensation at 100 percent of their prior salary with a cap of $75,000 a year.” The expansion would include coverage for “non-traditional workers,” including independent contractors and tipped workers. Additionally, Sanders is calling for a pause on student loan payments, evictions, and utility shut-offs. Sanders also calls for the U.S. government to “Empower Medicare to Lead Health Care Response.” Under Sanders’ proposal, everyone will receive free healthcare treatment for coronavirus testing, treatment, and the coming vaccination. Citing the “major shortage of ICU units and ventilators,” Sanders says the government must “work aggressively with the private sector to make sure that this equipment is available to hospitals and the rest of the medical community.” Sanders adds that the U.S. should: The Vermont lawmaker has used the public health crisis to push his political visions, such as Medicare for All.

"The Emergency Coronavirus Bill is set to be passed in the House of Commons without a vote in the coming days and could result in citizens being detained by police and even placed in isolation facilities for refusing to be tested for COVID-19. In a document released by the Department of Health and Social Care on Tuesday, the government announced that it would be “strengthening the quarantine powers of police and immigration officers”. The measures will be time-limited for up to two years and will only be enacted “when strictly necessary”, the government said, with The Times reporting that the bill will likely be passed in the lower house without a formal vote but “on the nod” with the legislation gaining Royal Assent before the houses rise for Easter next week. –Detaining those who refuse testing, restrict gatherings– “The bill will enable the police and immigration officers to detain a person, for a limited period, who is, or may be, infectious and to take them to a suitable place to enable screening and assessment,” the document said. Police may then be able to place those individuals in “appropriate isolation facilities to protect public health”. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week recommended that Britons avoid mass social gatherings, the bill would “enable the government to restrict or prohibit events and gatherings during the pandemic in any place” including in vehicles, trains, aircraft, or other vessels and even “any offshore installation”.

But, it only appears, if sickness affects the ability of Border Force staff to adequately police borders — not to halt migration from high-risk countries. The government said: “[The bill will] enable the Home Secretary to request that port and airport operators temporarily close and suspend operations if Border Force staff shortages result in a real and significant threat to the UK’s border security. “This is to ensure the UK can maintain adequate border security throughout the pandemic and protect the public from the threat of criminality or importation of prohibited items that could result from an inadequately controlled border. “This would only be used in extremis, where necessary and proportionate, and any direction will be kept to the minimum period necessary to maintain the security of the UK border.” Meanwhile, even the pro-open borders European Union has recommended that all member states lock down the bloc’s external borders to all but its own citizens, guest workers, and medics and scientists. –Streamlining the “death management system”– In a section with the sobering heading, “Managing the deceased with respect and dignity”, the government’s bill will allow measures that will enable “the death management system to deal with increased demand for its services”. Such measures include expanding the list of people who can register a death and for local authorities to order funeral directors, mortuary owners, and crematoria owners “to streamline the death management process” if the number of fatalities exceeds capacity. “This may include an increase in the operating times of crematoriums, directing companies to use their vehicles to move bodies, or directing others not directly involved in the funeral sector, to provide necessary support,” it said.

Recently retired medics and social care workers will be allowed to return to work and the law will allow for the emergency registration of students who are near the end of their training to get as many staff into the NHS as possible. For employees affected by sickness or quarantine, Statutory Sick Pay will be available from day one of absence, rather than the usual three. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement: “The new measures we will be introducing in the Emergency Coronavirus Bill this week will only be used when it is absolutely necessary and must be timed to maximise their effectiveness, but crucially they give the government the powers it needs to protect lives.” Countries including Italy and France have gone into lockdown, forcing citizens into isolation to halt the spread of the virus, while Austria has banned gatherings of five people or more.

"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Tuesday that the state is prepared for the possibility of declaring martial law in an effort to combat the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. “[W]e have the ability to do martial law … if we feel the necessity,” Newsom said during a press conference on California’s ongoing response to the deadly illness. In what would be an extraordinary measure, martial law is the suspension of ordinary law and the imposition of direct military control of a population. The governor has already placed the California National Guard on alert for humanitarian duties, including food distribution and public safety activities. California, which approved $1.1 billion in emergency funding on Monday, may exceed the state’s roughly $21 billion in reserves, warned Newsom. “The magnitude of this moment may exceed those reserves,” he said. Newsom also gave an assessment on the status of California schools, stating that “few if any” will reopen before summer. U.S. and California health officials have repeatedly warned that the virus could have a devastating impact and that the timetable for controlling it is not known. President Donald Trump on Monday said the crisis could last until August. California’s 415 hospitals have been planning for a surge of patients. They have about 88,000 beds and Newsom said health officials are running models to determine needs based on various infection rates and resulting hospitalizations. Under worst-case scenarios, California could be short 20,000 beds, he said. “So we had a very candid and a sober if not sobering conversation about where we may be and where we need to go together,” he said after the meeting with hospital officials. “The good news is none of it surprised any of us. We as a state, working with our system, anticipated much of these needs and have been running plans to address them.” He said the state should have the two large hospitals in its possession as early as Friday and will use money from the emergency authorization to get them ready for service.

"President Donald Trump announced Wednesday at the White House he would invoke the Defense Production Act. The act allows the president to expand the supply of resources from American industry to support the fight against the Chinese coronavirus, according to FEMA. “Just in case we need it … it can do a lot of good things if we need it,” Trump said. Invoking the Defense Production Act would give the administration the authority to speed up the production of needed resources, such as medical masks and hospital ventilators. Trump made the announcement to Americans at the White House press briefing room on Wednesday afternoon. The president also said FEMA would be activated on a level one disaster to offer federal support for the coronavirus response. “FEMA now is fully engaged at the highest levels,” Trump said. “Today, FEMA is activated in every region. We are at level one, level one being the highest level.” The president praised FEMA for handling recent hurricane response during his administration and promised that they would help significantly. “This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do,” Trump said. He recalled the heroism and sacrifices expressed by Americans in World War II and urged people to meet the moment. “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we’ll come through together,” Trump said. “It’s the invisible enemy that’s always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy, but we’re going to defeat the invisible enemy.”",Watch – Donald Trump Invoking Defense Production Act to Fight Coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/watch-donald-trump-invoking-defense-production-act-to-fight-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump continued backing his description of the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” on Tuesday saying it was not racist. The establishment media predictably reacted strongly against Trump’s use of the term “Chinese virus” on Twitter and in his news conference on Wednesday. ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega challenged the president during the news conference. “Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?” she asked, citing “dozens” of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans after the coronavirus spread. “Why do you keep using this?” Vega continued. “A lot of people say it’s racist.” “It’s not racist at all no, it comes from China that’s why I want to be accurate,” Trump said. Trump said he had a “great love” for everyone in the country, but said he felt the need, to be honest about the origins of the virus. PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor also challenged the president’s rhetoric, noting reports that someone called the coronavirus the “kung flu” in front of an Asian-American White House reporter. “I wonder who said that, do you know who said that?” Trump asked. “Say the term again.” Alcindor repeated the term “Kung Flu” twice and asked again about his use of the term “Chinese virus.” But Trump dismissed the idea that the term “Chinese virus” endangered Asian Americans. “I think they probably would agree with it 100 percent,” Trump said. “It comes from China.”",Watch – Donald Trump: Calling Coronavirus ‘Chinese Virus’ Is ‘Not Racist at All’,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/watch-donald-trump-calling-coronavirus-chinese-virus-is-not-racist-at-all/,Breitbart
"Health officials in New York City recorded 279 new coronavirus cases just between morning and night on Tuesday, bringing the total to 923 as testing increases and the mayor considers a “shelter in place” order within the next 48 hours in the most populous city in America. As of Tuesday night, there were ten coronavirus-related deaths in New York City, one of the largest cities in the world. NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio reportedly indicated that the total number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the city went from 644 on Tuesday morning to 923 at night time, marking an increase of 279. “BREAKING: [De Blasio] says that the city now 923 cases of [COVID-19], up from 644 THIS MORNING,” Jesse McKinley, the New York Times bureau chief in the capital of New York state, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night. “Also, now 10 deaths in the city”: BREAKING:  @BilldeBlasiosays that the city now 923 cases of #coronavirus, up from 644 THIS MORNING.

NYC, like other cities across the United States, is currently under drastic restrictions and shutdowns. On Tuesday afternoon, Mayor de Blasio warned city residents to prepare for a potential “shelter in place” order within the next 48 hours. “It is definitely a possibility at this point,” the NYC mayor told reporters, acknowledging that such a move would have to be approved by state officials. The New York Times explained: Mr. de Blasio did not elaborate on what such an order would look like in New York City, but a similar directive in California’s Bay Area requires people to stay at home except for essential activities. The mayor said that such an order could limit movement in the city to people with essential jobs like police officers, firefighters, and health care workers. It could also allow people to go outside to exercise, although he noted that Italy had imposed more restrictive measures. Soon after De Blasio briefed reporters, Gov. Cuomo rejected any suggestion that a “shelter in place” order was forthcoming. “Any blanket quarantine or shelter in place policy would require state action, and as the governor has said, there is no consideration of that for any locality at this time,” Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Cuomo, declared in a statement.

"President Donald Trump announced at the daily press conference of his coronavirus task force on Wednesday relief for Americans who rent or own homes in the form of temporarily stopping evictions and foreclosures. “The Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April,” Trump said. “We are working very closely with [HUD Secretary] Ben Carson and everyone from HUD,” Trump said. “Every generation has been called on to make such sacrifices for the good of the nation.” “In World War II, young people volunteered to fight,” Trump said. “They wanted to fight so badly because they loved our country.”  Details on exactly what housing markets would fall under this announcement was not provided at the press conference. The HUD website explains the federal agency’s role in U.S. housing: HUD and its roughly 9,600 employees occupy a leadership role in increasing homeownership, supporting community development, and increasing access to affordable housing that is free from discrimination. The HUD website states: “The Department of Housing and Urban Development is the Federal agency responsible for national policy and programs that address America’s housing needs, that improve and develop the Nation’s communities, and enforce fair housing laws. HUD’s business is helping create a decent home and suitable living environment for all Americans, and it has given America’s communities a strong national voice at the Cabinet level.

"Dr. Deborah Birx told Americans on Wednesday at the White House that the mortality rate for coronavirus would be higher in the early stages of the fight against the disease. “The mortality is higher at the beginning because you’re diagnosing the sickest, the ones who came in quite ill,” she said to reporters during a White House press briefing on Wednesday afternoon. Birx added that the risk for serious illness among the majority of Americans was low but that they could transmit the disease to the elderly. “I just want to remind the American public that still the risk for serious illness in the majority of Americans are low,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that you can’t transmit it to one of those higher-risk groups, and that’s why we’re asking for all Americans to take responsibility.” The people currently dying from the disease, she explained, were diagnosed two to three weeks ago with the illness or where it had been contracted in nursing homes. “If we’re going to solve this with a lower death rate, we have to protect the elderly because of their percent is much higher in mortality than any other age group,” she said. But Birx also said that more young people in the millennial generation were contracting the virus than expected in countries like Italy and France. “It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation, that will carry us through for the next multiple decades — there may be a disproportional number of infections among that group,” she said. President Donald Trump urged all young people to adhere to the guidelines from the federal government urging them to stop gathering in large groups. “We don’t want them gathering, and I see they do gather, including on beaches, including in restaurants,” Trump said. “Young people, they don’t realize.

"Nearly 6.3 million noncitizens were granted admission to the United States in the last two and a half months by air, land, and sea at ports of entry along the northern border before Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a national lockdown. On March 16, Trudeau said he would be shutting down Canada’s borders to noncitizens with exemptions for permanent Canadian residents, diplomats, aircrews, and American citizens. Before the announcement, Trudeau had not issued a single travel ban — not even for China, Iran, South Korea, or Italy. Federal data obtained by Breitbart News finds that between January 1 and March 15, a total of 6,275,009 noncitizens were granted admission to the U.S. from Canada. The overwhelming majority, 6,254,052 noncitizens, arrived via land, while 16,420 arrived at sea and 4,537 via air travel. (Screenshot via Department of Homeland Security) These noncitizens include the millions of Canadians who are admitted to the U.S. on a daily basis for nonimmigrant, temporary purposes and not to permanently resettle. These admissions are in addition to the nearly 10,400 northern border crossers encountered by Border Patrol in January and February, as Breitbart News reported. The number of apprehensions and admissions come as President Trump has announced that he will close the northern border to non-essential travel — effectively shutting off entry to foreign nationals living in Canada. The nation’s leading medical experts have routinely said that border and immigration controls are necessary to stop the growing outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S. Last week, experts said 30 states had seen coronavirus outbreaks specifically because of travel to the U.S. from Europe.

"Hordes of young people defied orders to practice social distancing as coronavirus concerns steadily increase, congregating on South Florida beaches Tuesday despite official calls to limit social events to groups of ten. The phenomenon speaks to the growing generational tension between younger Americans — who, as President Trump said, may feel “invincible” in this time of crisis — and older Americans who remain at a higher risk. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Tuesday the mass closure of bars and nightclubs as the coronavirus pandemic festers in the United States and in the state of Florida. He did not provide a stringent order for beaches in the Sunshine State but said the statewide position is in accordance with the CDC guidance of “no group on a beach more than ten.” “You have to have distance apart if you’re going to be out there,” DeSantis said during Tuesday’s press conference. “So that will apply statewide.” The governor noted that local officials could take more aggressive action depending on the situations in their respective communities. Officials in the Miami area, for example, have taken more aggressive action, with Miami Beach imposing a curfew on popular blocks of South Beach and shutting down public beaches “from Fifth through 15th streets — including Lummus Park” in South Beach. According to the Miami Herald: In Miami Beach, the emergency measures will run through at least March 19, but City Manager Jimmy Morales — who invoked his emergency powers on Thursday through a declaration of state of emergency — will ask the City Commission to extend them. … The directives expand the scope of an emergency measure Morales ordered Saturday to close three blocks of beach in South Beach early beginning at 4:30 p.m. On Friday, Morales issued his first emergency order requiring the city’s most popular restaurants and clubs to limit their capacity to under 250 people. Fort Lauderdale has also prohibited gatherings of more than 250 people. “The status quo with crowds of spring breakers is absolutely unacceptable,” Miami Beach Commissioner Mark Samuelian said in a statement. “Every health expert is telling us we need social distancing — less interaction to reduce transmissions.” “While I empathize with our businesses and their employees, I fully support the City Manager’s additional emergency measures to enhance public safety,” he added. Despite best efforts from officials, younger people have continued to flock to South Florida beaches, seemingly ignoring the calls to practice social distancing. That practice, officials say, could curb the impact of the virus on vulnerable Americans — older generations and those with underlying health issues. Nevertheless, photos show dozens, if not hundreds, of spring breakers on Miami’s South Beach reveling in their youth on St. Patrick’s Day, twerking, wrestling, and partying despite the Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber previously deeming spring break effectively “over.” “We can’t have the kinds of crowds we’ve had, the kinds of gatherings,” Gelber said during a news conference on Sunday. “I walked down Ocean Drive yesterday, and what I saw was incredibly disturbing. It wasn’t just the typical large gatherings of people, but it was young people who believe they’re invincible and probably don’t really think of this in any way as a health crisis,” he added. Local 10 reported a similar phenomenon last week, noting that crowds on Hollywood Beach “were out in full force despite coronavirus concerns.” The refusal to heed to the warnings of public health officials is furthering the generational divide across the board. None summed up the harsh reality better than actress Vanessa Hudgens, who came under fire after telling her 38 million Instagram followers that extreme social distancing measures are “bullshit” because “like, yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible, but like, inevitable?” She has since apologized for her “insensitive” words. Nonetheless, President Trump said on Wednesday that younger generations need to “heed the advice” of officials. “We don’t want them gathering, and I see they do gather — including on beaches and including in restaurants — young people. They don’t realize — they’re feeling invincible,” Trump said during a Wednesday press conference. “They were feeling totally invincible or are feeling that way but they don’t realize they can be carrying lots of bad things home to grandmother and grandfather and even their parents,” he continued. “So we want them to heed the advice. We made the advice, and I think it’s getting through. I do believe it’s getting through,” he added.

"Ford, General Motors (GM), and Fiat Chrysler announced plans on Wednesday to close all factories in the United States to protect workers from possible coronavirus infection. Ford executives said their U.S. plants will shut down from March 19 to March 30 while GM executives said their U.S. plants would close at least through March 30.  said it will begin a “systematic orderly suspension” of production through at least March 30. The decisions come after the nation’s three largest automakers entered negotiations with the United Auto Workers (UAW) to determine how best to deal with the coronavirus crisis. UAW leaders said in a statement that U.S. plant closures will be implemented on a “rotating partial shutdown” policy that distances American workers from each other and prevents large groups from working the same shifts. “We spent hours tonight in talks with the leadership of the Big 3, demanding that they do the right thing for our members,” UAW leaders said. “All three companies have agreed to new measures that will increase adherence to CDC recommendations on social distancing in the workplace.” “Most importantly, all three companies have agreed to review and implement the rotating partial shutdown of facilities, extensive deep cleaning of facility and equipment between shifts, extended periods between shifts, and extensive plans to avoid member contact,” they continued. “They will be working on shift rotation to minimize risk. The companies have also agreed to work with us in Washington, D.C., on behalf of our members as we manage the disruption in the industry.” Breitbart News Economic Editor John Carney predicted on SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Tonight that work which cannot be done from home would be halted due to the coronavirus crisis. “It’s not just going to be bars and the restaurants and the movie theatres, it’s going to be a lot more. Anything that you can’t do from your home is going to stop being done in America,” Carney said. Ford executives said in its statement that it will work with the UAW in the coming weeks on plans to restart factories, as well as exploring more procedures to prevent the virus from spreading. The union has been pushing for factories to close because workers are fearful of coming into contact with the virus. The companies’ decisions reverse a deal worked out late Tuesday in which the automakers would cancel some shifts so they could thoroughly cleanse equipment and buildings, but keep factories open. But workers, especially at some Fiat Chrysler factories, were still fearful and were pressuring the union to seek full closures. The move by General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford will idle about 150,000 American auto workers. They likely will receive supplemental pay in addition to state unemployment benefits. The two checks combined will about equal what the workers normally make. The Associated Press (AP) contributed to this report.  John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Republicans blamed some of their 2018 losses in California on “ballot harvesting.” And Republican efforts to copy Democrats’ tactics have failed because Republicans are generally more reluctant to give their ballots to others. Clinton is familiar with the value of voting by mail: she was thought to be running neck-and-neck with Sen.

"On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) laid out the demands Democrats have for the third coronavirus bill, and stated that repairing the social safety net and “changing the way we think about how corporations should govern” are potential positives and future improvements that could come out of dealing with the “horrible crisis” of the coronavirus. Schumer said, “I think there will be bailouts of the [airline] industry and other industries. … But I’d say a few things. Number one, any bailout that Democrats will support has to put the workers first. We’re not going to bail out an industry and have them cut workers, cut their salaries, and all kinds of things like that. This is for the workers, above all. Second, we’re going to have to put some brakes on some of these executives. The [airline] industry itself did about $300 billion in stock buybacks over the last year. … That is outrageous. And we’re going to have to, somehow, figure out how to make up for that. Because the airlines shouldn’t be allowed to do that, in the past, or in the future. And none of this can go to executive salaries or things like that. So, if I had to describe what kind of rescue of the [airline] industry that we would support, it’s worker-friendly above all. Second, get rid of the corporate excesses, not just during this situation, but permanently.” He added that Democrats will demand that paid sick leave and paid family leave, a remake of unemployment insurance into “employment insurance,” and a “Marshall Plan for our hospitals” be included in the bill. Schumer later stated, “[I]n this awful, awful cloud, maybe a little good will come out of it. The social safety net has been ripped apart, particularly in the last ten years, when the Tea Party was so dominant in the House of Representatives, and now, in many ways in the White House. To restore some of that social safety net by improving unemployment insurance, by improving paid leave, family leave and sick leave, and doing many other things, and changing the way we think about how corporations should govern.

"Representative Robert Aderholt (R-AL) sees the federal government’s effort to tackle the coronavirus threat as something you might see in a “wartime scenario.” Therefore, it should be approached with a similar sort of vigor as an act of war by a hostile nation. During an interview that aired on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN this week, he made the comparison arguing the present was not the time to worry about “pinching pennies.” “This is sort of like in a time of war — you don’t worry about pinching pennies if you think you might lose the war,” he said. “And this really is like a wartime scenario where we have a war on the coronavirus. If we’re being attacked by some other country where they’re coming directly at us, we’re worried about saving lives and saving the country.” The Alabama Republican congressman also acknowledged a level of cooperation between the two sides in the House of Representatives in the battle against the pandemic. “I think there is a lot more bipartisanship right now,” Aderholt said. “I mean, you still have some sparring, a little bit. I know the president and some of the governors have had a little bit of sparring. But by and large, things are a lot better. I think that’s one positive thing that’s come out of this is a little more bipartisanship with it. And hopefully, this will be something that can continue. Obviously, that’s the type of system we’re built on, where we have the parties spar with each other because that is what you want.” “Instead of us having a system where other countries that are shooting people, and they’re killing people and assassinating people — we have those discussions where we publicly disagree about issues,” he continued. “But at the end of the day, nobody is bleeding in the streets and things like that. You know, there’s a certain amount where there needs to be some disagreement between the parties because they protect each other, and make sure one party is not dominating. But at the same time — at the end of the day, in situations like this, we all have to come together.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",GOP Rep.

"Here’s a thought: While self-quarantining with their families in multimillion-dollar Manhattan co-ops, Wall Street wives ought to have a chat with their Master of the Universe husbands about China, globalism and political correctness. Those are the vectors of their robber-baron wealth. Thanks to “globalism” — i.e., cheap goods from China — we’ve gotten many wondrous things, for example: — Toothpaste on American shelves made with a poison found in antifreeze. — Toxic Chinese drywall installed in about 100,000 U.S. homes, emitting noxious fumes that destroyed electrical wiring and metal fixtures and sickened homeowners. Replacement of the drywall, pipes and wiring cost Americans billions of dollars. — Hundreds, possibly thousands, of American dogs killed by melamine-laced Chinese dog food in 2007. — The loss of about 200,000 beautiful maple trees lining the streets of small New England towns, eaten by Asian long-horned beetles that arrived on Chinese cargo ships in 1996. The U.S. taxpayer spends hundreds of millions of dollars to eradicate the repeated outbreaks that continue to this day, despite promises from the Chinese to do better. — Viral pandemics — H1N1 (from China), bird flu (from China), SARS (from China) and now the Wuhan virus (from China). Is it really worth paying $3 for a T-shirt at Walmart, rather than $9? The precise reason Chinese goods are so cheap is that they skip the crucial quality-control step. The media’s reaction to this latest pandemic out of China is to say … LET’S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT: THE CHINESE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS! Well, like most animal-to-human viruses, this one did originate in China and then spread across the globe when Chinese tourists infected people in other countries. As described by Melinda Liu in Smithsonian Magazine, the Chinese wet markets, “often poorly ventilated, with multiple species jammed together — create ideal conditions for spreading disease through shared water utensils or airborne droplets of blood and other secretions.” This 2017 article was titled: “Is China Ground Zero for a Future Pandemic?” When the pandemic arrived, at least the World Health Organization leapt to action. First step: Find a cure? Develop a vaccine? Demand protections for the elderly? NO! WHO officials got together and worked on coming up with a new name for the “Wuhan virus” that sounded less Asian. Next, the WHO put out a “Fact Sheet” to ensure that those with Kung Flu would not be stigmatized. It instructed: “DO — talk about people ‘acquiring’ or ‘contracting’ #COVID-19. “DON’T — talk about people ‘transmitting COVID-19,’ ‘infecting others’ or “spreading the virus’ as it implies intentional transmission & assigns blame.” As fear of the Chinese virus spread, Gloria Allred brought a lawsuit against a Los Angeles school for sending an Asian student to the school nurse after he coughed in class. Americans are cowering in their homes. Airlines, restaurants, beaches, ski resorts, professional sports, colleges and stores have been shut down. But we must never violate the fundamental civil right of an Asian to cough in class and refuse to see the nurse! The New York Times has also been on the racism beat, with these pressing stories: As Chinese Grapple With a New Illness, an Old Stigma Is Revived An Outbreak of Racist Sentiment as Coronavirus Reaches Australia As Coronavirus Spreads, So Does Anti-Chinese Sentiment And there’s more! Virus Fuels Anti-Chinese Sentiment Overseas Coronavirus Outbreak Risks Reviving Stigma for China Wait – here’s another: For a Chinese Traveler, Even Paradise Comes With Prejudice A few weeks ago — before a trillion dollars in wealth was destroyed by the coronavirus panic and we learned the real disease was racism — everyone, including the Times, admitted that the virus was brought to Italy by two Chinese tourists. “[T]here had not yet been any confirmed cases in Italy,” the Times reported, until Jan. 30, “when the government announced the first two cases.” The scientific director of an infectious diseases hospital in Rome identified them: “two Chinese tourists visiting Rome.” The Times buried this fact in an article perversely titled: “Cruise Passengers Are Held at Italian Port in False Alarm Over Coronavirus.” On one hand, a bunch of cruise passengers were inconvenienced for 12 hours; on the other hand, a viral pandemic that could kill millions was introduced to Italy. You write the headline. Lombardy is the Italian region most devastated by the Wuhan virus. As far back as 2003, a Library of Congress report cited Lombardy as having the highest concentration of Chinese immigrants in Italy. Our media refuses to tell us this fact today — or any day. No hard feelings, but why not relieve people’s minds? West Virginians who have no contact with anyone visiting from China can rest easy! No need to stockpile toilet paper. While we’re at it, when will the media and the “medical community” get around to informing Americans that this latest Chinese pandemic poses little danger to anyone under 70 without certain chronic medical conditions? Italy has been ravaged by the Wuhan virus, but the average age of the dead is 81. According to the dire estimates of the Imperial College of London — whose assessment we are following — excepting those with underlying medical conditions, the new coronavirus could be less deadly than the seasonal flu to anyone under 60 years old and no worse than the 2017-18 flu season for those in their 60s. But it’s five to 10 times more deadly than the regular flu for those in their 70s and 80s, respectively. We ought to surround old folks homes with the National Guard and call it a day. It would probably save more lives and wouldn’t destroy the economy. But there’s no time to think about saving lives. The important thing is to stamp out the idea that a virus that originated in China has anything to do China.","Ann Coulter: Cheap TVs, Expensive Flu",2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/ann-coulter-cheap-tvs-expensive-flu/,Breitbart
"The nation’s immigration enforcement agency is reducing its arrests of illegal migrants amid growing fears of a coronavirus outbreak in federal detention centers. “ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) will focus enforcement on public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds,” said a press statement issued on March 18. “For those individuals who do not fall into those categories, ERO will exercise discretion to delay enforcement actions until after the crisis or utilize alternatives to detention, as appropriate.” “This is a return to ‘felons, not families,'” which was the policy adopted by President Barack Obama, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a pro-migration advocate at the American Immigration Council. “Though I strongly suspect ICE will not revert to the prosecutorial discretion policies of the Obama administration and that this will primarily impact who is targeted for arrest,” he added. Up to 50,000 recent migrants and violent illegal migrants are already detained in centers around the nation. Federal courtrooms remain open while their deportation cases are being processed, according to pro-migration lawyers. The statement was released after President Donald Trump said he would block additional visitors, migrants, and asylum seekers at the southern and northern borders. The statement, however, did not say if the United States has permission from Mexico’s government to return migrants from Mexico back into Mexico after they are caught at the border. White-collar immigration lawyers and pro-migration groups are still demanding that Trump admit the roughly 30,000 migrants who have been sent back to Mexico before their asylum hearings in the United States. The large population of illegal residents in the United States reduces wages for blue-collar Americans — especially amid the economic crash spurred by migrants from China.

Examples include investigations into child exploitation, gangs, narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, human smuggling, and continued participation on the Joint Terrorism Task Force. This work will be conducted based on ability to coordinate and work with prosecutors from the Department of Justice and intake at both the U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons. The statement also said that ICE would not arrest migrants who are seeking medical care because of China’s disease: Consistent with its sensitive locations policy, during the COVID-19 crisis, ICE will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, such as hospitals, doctors’ offices, accredited health clinics, and emergent or urgent care facilities, except in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Individuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement.

"The media is celebrating that the coronavirus –– which has killed over 3,000 in China –– could be combating climate change as nations’ economies around the world are ground to a halt. CNN reported on the “blue skies” in China in recent days: Factories were shuttered and streets were cleared across China’s Hubei province as authorities ordered residents to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. It seems the lockdown had an unintended benefit — blue skies. The average number of “good quality air days” increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period last year, according to China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment. NASA, which promotes climate change on its website,  released images that show a reduction of nitrogen dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial plants during January and February — the height of the coronavirus pandemic in China. “This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,” Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the CNN report. “I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize the spread of the virus.” The Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), an “air pollution research organization,” hailed the reduction of coal production, an energy source that helps save lives in China as a source for warming homes. Leftists hope this trend continues. “We would very much advocate for China to foster this opportunity to transform its economy, to break apart from the old,” Li Shuo, a senior climate policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, said in the CNN report. “There might be a round of economic stimulus which would inject cheap credits to heavy industries in China, and as a result of that we might see increasing pollutants and also carbon emissions in the second half of this year,” Li said. But communist China is planning to reboot its economy. “President Xi has made clear that workers and factories need to ramp up activity as soon as possible if the country is to avoid a steeper economic downturn,” CNN reported.

"On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “The Story,” Biden Campaign Senior Adviser Symone Sanders said that while some of what President Trump said during that day’s coronavirus briefing was good, he also referred to the coronavirus by “a racial slur.” Sanders said, “Testing is still a real issue. We were happy to see the Trump administration and the president come out to the podium today and enact a number of sweeping changes. But the reality is, we have to ensure that we are doing what’s best for the American people. That means testing. That means being as innovative and creative as we can. But that also means being transparent.” She added, “[I]f the Trump administration is getting the number of tests out that they said are going to get out, then that is amazing. But the reality is, we have not seen the tests that the Trump administration promised in the field and we have not seen those results yet. Now, results could be coming. … And some of what he said today was good. But the reality is, he also stood at the podium and called the coronavirus, COVID-19, what I would suggest is a racial slur.” Host Martha MacCallum then mentioned Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) as an example of a disease that is named after where it originated and also brought up China’s obfuscation on the virus. Sanders responded that China refused to let American scientists in to research the virus, but maintained that Trump’s name for the virus is “offensive” and that testing and informing the public are the key issues.

Host Anderson Cooper said, “Senator Schumer, after 9/11, the terrible days right after 9/11, there was an extraordinary spirit, not only in the country but in New York City. It was a privilege to be in New York at that time, to stay with the city, and to watch the people come together. Citizenship seems to be more important now than it has been for a long time in our lives. Can you talk to people about what that means? Whether it’s New York or somewhere else? To be a good citizen right now?” Schumer said, “I have lived through 9/11. I lost three friends that I knew in the towers. I was there through the crash of 2008, but this is the worst of all for a variety of reasons. First, we’re uncertain as to what is going to happen. There was some uncertainty after 9/11, in the days after we were worried we might be attacked again, but it’s not the same as this. How long is this going to last? Who does it affect? We’re not even certain when or who it affects. We’re just learning that children can be affected by the illness. So there’s that. And then there’s isolation. What New Yorkers—Americans like to come together as we did after 9/11, in times of crisis, but here you can’t. You’re not supposed to be near other people, because obviously, it spreads the disease. I urge people to make sure they keep their distance. But it’s much harder. Having said that, I believe in the spirit of New Yorkers.

"Journalists are accusing Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) of calling undocumented immigrants “non-people,” when he literally meant fictional people who do not exist that are fraudulently claimed for tax credits. In order to pay for plans to combat coronavirus, Paul proposed extending a law that ensures that people cannot claim tax credits for children who do not have a social security number or make fraudulent claims for children who do not exist. “Taxpayer money should not go to non-people,” he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “It says you have to have a Social Security number.” Paul’s office told Breitbart News that he was discussing the claims of fictional individuals — which individuals have done in past tax filings. Paul’s Deputy Chief of Staff Sergio Gor said in a statement: When the senator spoke of ‘non-people,’ he was referring to literally fraudulent practices where individuals claim children that don’t exist or children they don’t have, but their tax credits increase due to this fraudulent practice… This has nothing to do with undocumented immigrants.

Multiple individuals were arrested and charged with coordinating hundreds of false returns. Similarly, a separate scam was traced, leading to 398 returns to two apartments, totaling more than $1.9 million in additional child tax credits, with no guarantee that the children existed or lived in the U.S. Current law requires a Social Security number to be included when claiming a Child Tax Credit, but it is set to expire in 2026. Paul’s proposal would have extended the provision to ensuring the IRS is not giving money away to those ineligible for the provision. The law’s goal was to address cases where undocumented immigrants claimed credits for ineligible children, including some who did not reside in the U.S., or cases where individuals claimed credits for non-existent children. “Cases on both fronts came to a halt when the IRS did adopt the Social Security requirement, which Senator Paul sought to extend,” Gor said. Paul’s proposal also included ending the Afghanistan War, which costs the U.S. about $50 billion a year to sustain.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Rand Paul Team Rips Fake News Attacks over ‘Non-People’ Getting Tax Credits,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/rrand-paul-team-rips-fake-news-attacks-over-non-people-getting-tax-credits/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act on Wednesday, sending over $100 billion in aid to Americans suffering economically from the spread of the Chinese virus. The president did not sign the bill publicly, as the White House sent a statement from Trump notifying his approval of the legislation. “The Act makes emergency supplemental appropriations and other changes to law to help the Nation respond to the coronavirus outbreak,” Trump said in his statement. The bill negotiated between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offers emergency paid sick leave, child care leave, as well as expanded unemployment benefits. It also allows Medicaid funding for free coronavirus testing and additional funds for food assistance programs. The bill passed 90-8 in the Senate on Wednesday afternoon after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Republicans to support the bill despite concerns from Republican senators. “This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” McConnell said. The Senate is currently drafting another massive spending bill to rescue the economy, send money directly to Americans, and bolster businesses facing ruin after the virus sparked economic shutdown.

"Millions of Americans across the country are, day by day, adjusting their lives to better cope with the economic, social, and political impacts caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, as a dark money network simultaneously works overtime to further politicize the festering crisis. A Democrat-aligned Super PAC announced on Tuesday that it will spend $5 million on negative ads targeting President Trump’s response to the coronavirus. “The campaign from Pacronym — a political action committee affiliated with the nonprofit group Acronym — represents the first major pivot to coronavirus-related advertising fewer than 250 days from the election,” the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. Acronym owns the technology firm Shadow, Inc., which was responsible for developing the infamous app used in the chaotic Iowa caucuses. Notably, the firm’s founder and CEO, Tara McGowan, “worked for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign and previously served as the digital director for NextGen America, a progressive organization founded by presidential candidate Tom Steyer,” as RealClearPolitics noted. Acronym is funded by the “liberal dark money group” New Venture Fund, which is “part of a larger group called Arabella Advisors, which provides philanthropic guidance and manages four nonprofits,” according to the nonpartisan ethics watchdog group Americans for Public Trust. Those also include the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, and Hopewell Fund. The financial web, however, goes far beyond those connections. The political group American Bridge, which was founded by David Brock — a close ally of the Clintons and founder of Media Matters for America — is also involved in the overarching efforts to spread misinformation on President Trump’s response to the coronavirus and further politicize the crisis. “American Bridge’s network of nonprofits received funding in 2018 from New Venture Fund, as well as another Arabella group called Sixteen Thirty Fund,” Americans for Public Trust reports. The Post notes that American Bridge has been running political advertisements on Trump’s response to the crisis in key swing states — Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. According to the Post, the group signaled that more was coming, including an ad focusing on “‘Trump’s incompetence,’ including ‘clips of Trump himself downplaying the crisis.'” “Our job is to hold Donald Trump accountable, and we have no plans to let up, particularly with a focus on economic issues as we’ve done to date,” American Bridge President Bradley Beychok said, according to the outlet. He added that the group is “not going to give him [Trump] a pass for bungling the government’s response to this pandemic.” Adam Laxalt, former Attorney General of Nevada and Outside Counsel to Americans for Public Trust, blasted the progressive groups’ dark money efforts to instill fear in the midst of the pandemic to score “cheap political points.” He said: Nobody should be using people’s fear of Coronavirus to score cheap political points. But while most Americans are rallying together as one to get through this crisis, left-wing dark money groups led by Arabella Advisors and David Brock are playing out of Rahm Emanuel’s old playbook: ’never letting a crisis go to waste.’ These dark money groups have launched millions of dollars in attack ads against President Trump and Republicans, echoing the Chinese Communist government’s efforts to spread dissension and turmoil. Arabella and Brock should be ashamed of themselves,” he added. “American lives are more important than scoring cheap political hits. Notably, the nonprofit Sixteen Thirty Fund reportedly spent “$141 million on more than 100 left-leaning causes during the midterm election year,” according to tax filings, as originally reported Politico. Americans for Public Trust adds: Sixteen Thirty Fund has been tied to additional spending on coronavirus-related advertising, from the group Protect Our Care. Protect Our Care is a trade name of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, structured as a branch of the larger nonprofit. Establishment media outlets have also been at play in promoting false narratives regarding the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. Perhaps one of the most prominent narratives, promoted by countless celebrity figures, is the fake news that President Trump dismissed the virus as a “hoax.” The narrative came to life following Trump’s MAGA rally in Charleston, South Carolina, where he told the crowd of enthusiastic supporters that Democrats were “politicizing the coronavirus.” He suggested that their desire to blame him –not  the virus itself — was the “new hoax.” Trump said: One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost, it’s all turning. Think of it, and this is their new hoax.” “No, hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody,” Trump said after the false narrative took off. “That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether its the impeachment hoax or the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. This is what I’m talking about.” Trump’s critics are also attempting to peddle the narrative that Trump’s decision to refer to the virus as the “Chinese virus,” is, in and of itself, racist. Reporters asked Trump about his use of the term during Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s coronavirus press briefings. Trump defended his use of the phrase each time. “Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?”ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega asked on Wednesday. “Why do you keep using this?” “A lot of people say it’s racist,” she contended. “It’s not racist at all. No, it comes from China that’s why I want to be accurate,” Trump said. Trump’s failed political challenger Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) have attempted to brand the description as racist and bigoted, furthering the political divide in the midst of the pandemic. That narrative is relatively recent, as several establishment outlets used the very terminology progressives now find problematic — “Chinese virus,” “Chinese coronavirus,” and “Wuhan virus” — on multiple occasions just weeks ago. Trump has since declared a national emergency and has continually provided the American people with updates, alongside his coronavirus task force, on the administration’s continuing response to the virus. The White House introduced “stage 3” of its economic proposal, which includes payments issued directly to the American people. As Breitbart News detailed: The plan calls for payments to be distributed to individuals on April 6 and May 18, according to a Treasury Department memo obtained by the Washington Post‘s Heather Long.
Payment amounts would be tiered according to income, presumably falling for individuals with higher incomes. The plan calls for payments to go to “individual taxpayers,” likely an indication that the government would use tax rolls and the Internal Revenue Service to distribute money and determine which Americans are eligible for which amounts. The memo also says the payments would be linked to family size, addressing concerns of some pro-family advocates who pointed out a program that paid a flat fee to households or taxpayers would penalize those with large families. The U.S. tax code generally allows taxpayers to set aside more of their income for household support for each dependent family member. The memo also outlines a $300 billion plan to aid small businesses and their employees through a business interruption loan program. These loans would be made by financial institutions and backed by the federal government for amounts up to 100 percent of 6 weeks payroll, capped at $80,000 annual salary per employee. Trump on Wednesday said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which “allows the president to expand the supply of resources from American industry to support the fight against the Chinese coronavirus.” He also urged young people to heed the warnings of public health officials and maintain the practice of social distancing as an effort to curb the impact of the virus in their local communities. Regardless of his administration’s aggressive proposals, actions, and continual updates, the progressive dark money web appears to be working to undermine his administration’s efforts and, as a consequence, the confidence of the American people.","Dark Money Progressive Groups Spending Millions to Politicize Coronavirus, Spread Fear",2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/dark-money-progressive-groups-spending-millions-to-politicize-coronavirus-spread-fear/,Breitbart

Breitbart News reported in April 2019 the U.S. Census Bureau has found immigration is driving nearly half of all U.S. population growth, rather than increased birth rates: The latest Census Bureau estimates on the U.S. population reveal that about 48.5 percent of all population growth is driven by the country’s mass illegal and legal immigration policy, where more than 1.5 million foreign nationals are admitted to the country every year. Maine Family Planning, a group of 18 clinics, which includes Planned Parenthood in southern Maine, says it will still be performing abortions as well during the coronavirus pandemic, at a cost of $500. Kieltyka stated the organization is expanding its telehealth services to allow patients to complete forms online in order to spend as little time at a clinic. “As the novel coronavirus COVID-19 impacts health care facilities across the region, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (PPNNE) is taking precautions and continuing to provide care at its 21 health centers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont,” the organization said in a statement, according to WABI News.",Maine Clinics Extend Birth Control Prescriptions for Fear of ‘Baby Boom’,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/maine-clinics-extend-birth-control-prescriptions-for-fear-of-baby-boom/,Breitbart
"Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham says the United States should halt all immigration during the coronavirus crisis. On Wednesday, State Department officials confirmed to Breitbart News that the refugee resettlement program — which has resettled nearly 2,500 refugees in the last six weeks — would be suspended until at least April 7. Likewise, a State Department official told Reuters that most visa services through the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency would be suspended until further notice, though federal immigration officials have yet to clarify which visa programs will continue to bring foreign nationals to the U.S. Ingraham suggested in a post online that the Trump administration should implement an immigration moratorium while trying to stop the coronavirus outbreak and as millions of Americans are forced to stay home from work. Many of those workers rely on hourly minimum wages and tips. “All immigration to the US should be halted due to this national emergency — we sure as heck don’t need any foreign workers with millions of Americans on verge of losing their jobs,” Ingraham wrote, along with “#AmericaFirst.” All immigration to the US should be halted due to this national emergency—we sure as heck don’t need any foreign workers with millions of Americans on verge of losing their jobs.  #AmericaFirst — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 18, 2020  All foreign worker visas must be stopped. https://t.co/EjRyjZmbam — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 18, 2020  Even as White House officials are reportedly warning of a 20 percent unemployment rate, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials confirmed to the Washington Times that the agency would keep in place its recent decision to import an additional 35,000 H-2B foreign visa workers to take non-agricultural U.S. jobs. Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut. Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan wrote in a post online: Trump official reportedly warns of potential 20% unemployment due to the pandemic (and the public response). So why are we still admitting visa workers? Especially the H-2B unskilled workers supposedly needed for seasonal or peak load. Shut it down.

Currently, there are about 45 million foreign-born residents living in the U.S., a 108-year record high. The country’s last immigration boom — between 1900 and 1920 — was eventually met with a near immigration moratorium. Between 1925 and 1966, the U.S. legal immigration level did not exceed 327,000 annual admissions. Since major changes were enacted in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson (D) and in the 1990s by President George H.W. Bush (R) — changes that allow foreign nationals to bring as many foreign relatives to the country as they want — legal immigration levels have continued booming for about five decades. Today, about 1.2 million legal immigrants are admitted to the U.S. every year. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) argued Wednesday on Fox News to “go big” on a response to the threat coronavirus poses to the American economy. The South Carolina Republican argued the cost could be much more if some type of intervention is not taken by the federal government, arguing it was the price of “containment.” “The bottom line is, I have been on the Hill all day,” he said. “I haven’t seen this kind of spirit since 9/11. Everybody is looking at each other as an ally, not a foe. People in America, you begin to see the best of the country, the young lady on the show before delivering food to elderly people, allowing seniors to shop ahead of everybody else in grocery stores. It’s going to take that kind of spirit to defeat this. But here’s the problem. Eighty percent of the workforce is going to be impacted by the containment policies.” “The money we’re spending to deal with healthcare is going to pale in comparison with the money we spend to stabilize the economy,” Graham added. “If you have been laid off today in South Carolina from a bar or a restaurant or a hotel, I’m looking to make sure that we have wage replacement, that we replace your income as much as possible so that you don’t have your life turned upside down. That’s the number one goal of phase three for me.” The expensive policy, according to Graham, was the cost of containing coronavirus. “We’re buying containment,” he said. “Everything I have just talked to you about is the price of containment. Shutting every bar and restaurant down in South Carolina is the cost of containment. We either pay now as a country, or we pay later. And what do we do until we turn the corner? And what would turning the corner look like? A week where you had less infections than the week prior when therapies are in place to reduce the mortality rate.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",Graham: ‘I’m Looking to Make Sure That We Have Wage Replacement’ — ‘We’re Buying Containment’,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/18/graham-im-looking-to-make-sure-that-we-have-wage-replacement-were-buying-containment/,Breitbart
"The Wuhan coronavirus is officially a pandemic, and yet China continues to work overtime to conceal the origins and deflect any and all blame for this deadly illness — at the expense of the world’s health and our economy. While China withheld valuable, lifesaving information, President Trump endured partisan criticism as he took decisive action that helped slow the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus to the United States. President Trump was right to ban flights coming to the United States from China. When he made that decision over six weeks ago, Joe Biden — who has been dismissive of the threat posed by China and whose family has significant economic ties to the communist nation — criticized the President saying he was “fear-mongering” and xenophobic. That’s a claim he reiterated this week when President Trump prudently announced a ban on flights from Europe. Leading medical experts have agreed the President’s decision was the right thing to do. China’s lack of transparency has come at great expense. China’s communist regime has not disclosed the truth about the onset, the magnitude, nor the loss of lives, and in doing so, has put the health of its own people and people across the globe at serious risk. The regime censored its own doctors from sharing information about the virus, and a Chinese diplomat has spread a rumor that the United States military brought the coronavirus to China. By hiding the truth and burying the facts, the authoritarian regime hindered countries from acting earlier to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus from their country. It is outrageous that China’s communist leadership would turn their propaganda machine toward us not only to deflect, but to attempt to lay blame at our feet for something they have unleashed on the world. Indeed, the Chinese regime is more focused on running a public relations campaign than a public health campaign. And far too often our own media and like-minded liberals in Washington buy into this communist propaganda machine, criticizing some for calling it “the Wuhan coronavirus.” This episode has also made clear that we are far too dependent on China for very strategic supplies, like the therapeutic and pharmaceutical drugs necessary to fight health crises like this virus. Make no mistake, this deadly pandemic started in Wuhan, China, and they should be held accountable. We cannot back down and let their propaganda machine rewrite history, covering up lack of human compassion that values regime control over human lives. From Huawei to unfair trade to oppressive human rights violations, China has been working to compromise our security, weaken our economy, and harm our society. Since taking office, however, President Trump is standing up to China and fighting back to level the playing field, secure our nation, and decrease our strategic dependency on China. As the U.S. ambassador to Japan, I have seen this regime’s propaganda machine work firsthand. I worked with President Trump to sound the alarm regarding one of communist China’s largest technology companies, Huawei, as it attempts to imbed its technology within the critical digital infrastructure of our own nation and that of our closest allies. Communist China went unchecked for far too long, and I’m grateful for America’s leadership on this critically important issue. Right now, the Wuhan coronavirus is underscoring the real threat posed by the communist leadership in China that — rather than working to save the lives of its own people — prefers to silence opposition from within as it works to spread anti-American propaganda. We must stop the spread of false information and get to the bottom of how this virus originated, the number of people infected, and what China must do to prevent this from ever happening again. While we may never know just how bad the Wuhan coronavirus affected the Chinese people, we do know that it’s government-run health care system should not be replicated in the United States. According to reports, China’s health care system was already overburdened, and predictably they are running short of doctors and resources in the face of this outbreak. We are witnessing the central government run health care model fail in China. It’s difficult to imagine something more ineffective than the federal government coming between patients and their doctors at a time like this. We are fortunate to have a private sector to call upon for all-hands help and innovation when we encounter challenges beyond the government’s capabilities. This situation makes clearer than ever the dangers of allowing bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. to eliminate the incentives for innovation and impose “one-size- fits-all” decisions for our individual medical needs. The Wuhan coronavirus is impacting all of our lives, but together, I am optimistic that we can and will rise to this challenge. President Trump is engaging on all fronts to protect America, drawing on both the public and private sector to bring our nation through.  My family is continuing to pray for all those who have been affected by COVID-19, and I will continue to speak out against China’s misinformation campaign. We cannot allow China’s communist regime to succeed in their efforts to deflect responsibility and rewrite history.  As a nation, it is critical that we join to bring the best of our resources together to win this fight.

"The State Department is suspending refugee resettlement, at least temporarily, to the United States amid the coronavirus crisis. On Tuesday, the United Nations’ Refugee Agency — which helps facilitate which refugees are admitted to the U.S. annually — announced that they would be suspending their end of refugee resettlement. In a statement to Breitbart News, a State Department spokesperson said that a pause on refugee resettlement to the U.S. would take effect from March 19 through at least April 6. A spokesperson said: Due to the [UN Refugee Agency’s] temporary suspension, we notified our implementing partners to expect a refugee arrivals pause from March 19 through April 6. We will work with our implementing partners to plan for a resumption of refugee arrivals on or after April 7. Refugees are subject to the same COVID-19 travel restrictions as other travelers to the United States. The Department of State has no higher priority than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens. The announcement comes as the State Department continued resettling nearly 2,500 refugees to all but seven states in the country between February 1 and March 15 — even while the nation’s leading medical experts said migration and travel from abroad were aiding in spreading the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"The Department of Veterans Affairs stands “ready to surge” capabilities to supplement civilian health care systems in case they get overwhelmed, the department’s spokeswoman said in a statement to Breitbart News on Wednesday. “VA stands ready to surge capabilities into civilian health care systems in the event those systems encounter capacity issues, but at this time they are not encountering such issues,” VA Press Secretary Christina Mandreucci said in an email. “VA facilities are equipped with essential items and supplies to handle an influx of coronavirus cases,” she said. She said as of Friday, the VA had 13,000 acute care beds, including 1,800 intensive care unit beds. Any requests for VA assistance would come through the Department of Health and Human Services, which is leading the federal response to coronavirus. “When a State, Tribe, or Territory has determined that the maximum capacity of intrastate or interstate resources are exhausted, they may request assistance from the federal government through their local HHS Regional Emergency Coordinator (REC),” she said.

"The Democrats’ nomination horror flick “Weekend at Bernie’s” has turned into an even dumber horror movie: “Grumpy Old Men.” Watching Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders slug it out Sunday night — elbow-bumping from six feet apart in a social-distancing TV studio — was beyond bizarre. Perhaps it was a perfect reflection of what this whole process has been from the start — a goofball primary of un-seriousness during a global pandemic. The most mind-boggling part of the whole debate performance was trying to wrap your mind around the idea that one of these two old coots will actually wind up being the Democrat nominee. In these harrowing times, such a blank statement must come with some caveat, however. The Democrat nomination has come down to these two old, white septuagenarians. But in these turbulent times, it is entirely possible that something so wild and unforeseen happens that neither of these men actually wind up being the Democrat nominee come November. But as of Sunday night, they were America’s only choice. No moment encapsulated the ridiculousness of it all more than when Mr. Biden accused Mr. Sanders of being propped up by no fewer than nine so-called Super PACs, those nefarious political action committees fueled by “dark money” that Democrats despise — unless they are bankrolling Democrat candidates and Democrat causes. This would be a major chink in Mr. Sanders‘ claim to be beholden to no one, even if the charge was leveled by a guy who is entirely beholden to and propped up by the entire Democrat/media political establishment in Washington. “You get rid of the nine Super PACs you have?” Mr. Biden asked Mr. Sanders directly. “I don’t have nine Super — I don’t have ANY Super PACs,” sputtered Mr. Sanders, clearly flustered and laughing nervously. “You have nine. You want me to list them?” Mr. Biden shot back like John Wayne slinging a six-shooter. “Yeah, you go ahead and list them,” Mr. Sanders replied. Suddenly, Mr. Biden’s John Wayne moves left him completely. “OK, c’mon, give me a break,” the former vice president said weakly, turning back to his podium. “No, I won’t give you a break on this one!” But Mr. Biden’s six-shooter was out of ammo. And it turned out to be a pea-shooter anyway. With a bent barrel. Lord, have mercy, we are doomed if this is the best Democrats can come up with. Here you have two men with 155 years of combined accumulated wisdom here on planet Earth. Together, they have served in Washington a combined 76 years. And they are squabbling like a couple of schoolchildren about irrelevant nonsense on the playground. When you try to take them seriously and consider their actual records and the issues they have devoted their most to during their decades in Washington, things get even bleaker. Mr. Sanders has spent pretty much his entire adult life on the public teat. His two areas of expertise in recent years has been his service as chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and then ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. If there are two sterling jewels of accomplishment in the crown of your federal government, it would certainly NOT be in the areas of veterans’ affairs or budgeting. Mr. Biden, meanwhile, was vice president for eight years, yet for most of this primary he has been running away from that record to embrace zanier and zanier crackpot positions to keep up with all the young, crazy kids who were running for the nomination. Before serving as vice president, Mr. Biden was among the most widely admired sages on Capitol Hill — in the area of foreign policy! I mean, if there is one area that totally unifies regular, tax-paying Democrat and Republican voters across the country, it is that America’s foreign policy out of Washington has been a smoldering manure fire for decades. As former President Barack Obama might say, “Thanks, Joe!” But so far, Mr. Obama won’t even say that much on behalf of his old right hand man. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com or @charleshurt on Twitter.",Charles Hurt: Democrats’ Goofball Primary Continues Amid Global Pandemic,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/charles-hurt-democrats-goofball-primary-continues-amid-global-pandemic/,Breitbart

"Bill Gates, Microsoft founder and philanthropist, had a warning in a 2015 TED Talk when he spoke about the greatest global threat. It was not climate change or the big fear he said he remembered having as a kid: “When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war,” Gates said. “That’s why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.” “Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn’t look like this,” Gates said. “Instead, it looks like this. If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.” “Not missiles, but microbes,” Gates said. “Now, part of the reason for this is that we’ve invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we’ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We’re not ready for the next epidemic.” Gates cited the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014, which he said killed so many because no system was in place to combat this kind of infectious disease. And he called out the World Health Organization, the global organization that is on the frontlines of the current coronavirus outbreak, comparing it the to the cast of a thriller movie: “There’s a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that’s just pure Hollywood.” “The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola,” Gates wrote, citing the 10,000 death toll from the disease. So far, 8,732 people have died from coronavirus around the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University and Medicine. Gates said Ebola could have been much worse except for the “heroic work” of health care workers, the virus was not airborne, and third, it didn’t spread to densely populated urban areas. “So next time, we might not be so lucky,” Gates wrote, advocating in his Ted Talk for preparedness in the same way the military is ready for war at any given moment in time. Gates also called for helping third world countries improve their health infrastructure, building a “medical reserve corps,” and staging “germ war” games as has been done in the past, “and it didn’t go so well,” Gates said. Gates, a billionaire, said he did not know how much his ideas would cost, but he claimed it would be less than the kind of viral nightmare he envisioned. “So I think this should absolutely be a priority,” Gates wrote. “There’s no need to panic.” “We don’t have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement,” Gates said. “But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter ","Bill Gates Warned in 2015: Not War, But ‘Highly Infectious Virus’ the Greatest Threat to Humanity",2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/bill-gates-warned-in-2015-not-war-but-highly-infectious-virus-the-greatest-threat-to-humanity/,Breitbart

"The deadly and highly contagious novel coronavirus that has triggered a global pandemic can persist in droplets in the air for at least three hours, a new U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday revealed. Scientists from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a component of NIH, conducted the study that also determined that the virus can survive on steel and plastic surfaces for three days. The researchers also found that the virus remained on cardboard surfaces for 24 hours and on copper for four. NIAID scientists used a device to dispense an aerosol that mirrored the microscopic droplets released when a person coughs or sneezes to test the viability of the virus in the air. “Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of [novel coronavirus] is plausible since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days,” the scientists reported. The fact that the novel coronavirus can remain infectious in droplets in the air and on surfaces has likely fueled “community spread” among people who have not traveled. NIAID scientists found that when the droplets created by a cough or sneeze carry the novel coronavirus, it can infect people for at least three hours. They also determined that it takes a little over an hour (66 minutes) for half of the virus particles to decay if they are in an aerosol droplet. Reuters explained: That means that after another hour and six minutes, three quarters of the virus particles will be essentially inactivated, but 25% will still be viable. The amount of viable virus at the end of the third hour will be down to 12.5%, according to the research led by Neeltje van Doremalen of the NIAID’s Montana facility at Rocky Mountain Laboratories. World Health Organization (WHO) officials have named the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, to identify it as a close relative of the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. The organization named the infection caused by the virus, which originated in China, COVID-19. WHO has deemed the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.",Study: Coronavirus Can Remain Infectious in Air for Hours,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/study-coronavirus-can-remain-infectious-in-air-for-hours/,Breitbart
"Wednesday, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) defended calling the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus,” by arguing that China “is to blame” because they “eat bats and snakes and dogs.” Answering The Hill’s question about people calling the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus,” Cornyn said, “That’s where it came from.” The reporter asked, “Is it helpful because it alienates people? Like there is someone to blame. Like there is a group of people to blame.” The Texas Republican U.S. Senator answered, “I think China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people, and that’s why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine Flu, and now the coronavirus. So I think they have a fundamental problem, and I don’t object to geographically identifying where it’s coming from.” The reporter said, “Then it’s directed to Asian Americans. Then Asian Americans are feeling like it’s a racist thing.” Cornyn replied, “Oh, I disagree. We’re not talking about Asians. We’re talking about China where these viruses emanate from and which have created this pandemic.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Cornyn: China ‘Is to Blame’ for Coronavirus — They ‘Eat Bats and Snakes and Dogs’,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/18/cornyn-china-is-to-blame-for-coronavirus-they-eat-bats-and-snakes-and-dogs/,Breitbart
"Tuesday night, during CNN’s coverage of the Democratic primary results, Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas acknowledged none of the people on that news network’s set wanted President Donald Trump to win re-election in 2020. Rojas said, “I think that Senator Sanders’ campaign is much more than just a presidential campaign. It represents dozens of grassroots organizations, thousands of activists and organizers, Latinos, young people, millions of people that right now during this crisis, even before it felt like they were in a crisis, right? Because here in America, even before this pandemic hit, we have 67% of Americans that can’t afford an $800 emergency bill if that happened tomorrow, right? We have small business owners right now in the midst of the pandemic that aren’t sure if they’re going to have the support that they need.” “What I think that means right now is that millennials, we want Donald Trump to be defeated too,” she said on the CNN broadcast. “I think there’s nobody here that doesn’t want Donald Trump to be defeated. I think the question that I would ask to Joe Biden, as the presumptive nominee who needs to also focus on unifying the party, is the fact that millennials are going through their second recession right now.

"The federal government is using emergency laws to buy more bedside breathing ventilators to treat the rapidly rising inflow of victims from China’s Wuhan virus. “We are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators,” President Donald Trump said March 18, adding, “we are ordering a lot more.” The announcement came as hospitals scour their supply chains for the ventilators and tubing equipment needed to keep ailing victims alive until their lungs recover from the coronavirus. State officials are also trying to get more equipment. For example, Florida officials reportedly say they want 5,000 additional ventilators to treat their population of retirees. Medical professionals are also testing to see how they can use existing ventilators to save up to four similar patients at the same time. The nurse in the video is careful to stress:– sharing a ventilator is an ""off-label"" (read: non-FDA approved) use with nontrivial risks to patients– it should only be done in the most dire situations– patients of similar body mass and respiratory health need to be paired-up — Samuel Hammond ἱ🏛 (@hamandcheese) March 18, 2020  Trump and his deputies were not asked how many ventilators would soon be delivered. However, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said his agency is transferring ventilators to the hospitals. “We are prepared to distribute up to 3,000 ventilates, as needed,” he said. The Pentagon is keeping some ventilators for use by soldiers and family members who fall ill. Trump was asked why officials had not already launched plans to produce more of the life-saving ventilators. Trump dodged the question, saying, “Hospitals are supposed to have ventilators too, and we have thousands of ventilators. It sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these [demand] numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing.” Trump noted there may be a very high demand for ventilators as the epidemic spreads across the country: It depends on how it goes.  Worst case, absolutely [there will be a high demand]. Best case, not at all. So we’re going to have to see where it goes. But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators. Vice President Mike Pence offered reassurances, but he did not reveal the expected production numbers: We have a specific number of ventilators in the stockpile. It is in excess of 10,000, and you just heard the announcement from the Department of Defense that they will be adding several more thousand to that.  But the President, even this morning and yesterday, after speaking with the largest companies in the supply chain in this country, we’re hearing a tremendous spirit among industry leaders who are ready to step in and add to that volume [of ventilators]. The stockpiles don’t count all of the ventilators that exist today in the marketplace and in healthcare facilities around the country. But the President has given us a directive to make sure that our stockpile — but just as importantly, [by] working with industry leaders — that we’re securing the increase in ventilators, the increase in masks, gloves, eye protectors, care garments, that are all necessary … We’re confident we’ll be able to accomplish that with the incredible cooperation of the supply chain that exists in America today. The nation only has 170,000 ventilators, according to a February inventory by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Federal advisors project a need for up to 500,000 ventilators to save Americans from China's coronavirus.  That seems like a life & cost-saving option. U.S. manufacturers are trying to accelerate parts delivery. But there is no sign of federal $$ yet. https://t.co/yEtV9RW900 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 16, 2020  Nursing homes are especially vulnerable to the threat. For example, the China virus killed more than 30 elderly at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington state, partly because of inadequate preparedness and untrained staff. AP reported March 18: Several family members and friends who visited Life Care before the outbreak told The Associated Press that they didn’t notice any unusual precautions, and none said they were asked about their health or if they had visited China or any other countries struck by the virus. They said visitors came in as they always did, sometimes without signing in. Staffers had only recently begun wearing face masks. And organized events went on as planned, including a Feb. 26 Mardi Gras party, when residents and visitors packed into a common room, passed plates of sausage, rice and king cake, and sang as a band played “When the Saints Go Marching In.” “We were all eating, drinking, singing and clapping to the music,” Pat McCauley, who was there visiting a friend, told the AP. “In hindsight, it was a real germ-fest.” About 57% of the patients at the nursing home were hospitalized after getting infected. Of those, more than 1 in 4 died. One traveler from China directly about 30 people with coronavirus in the Seattle area during January and Feb.

"Hundreds of Pakistanis are flooding into hospitals in Karachi with flu-like symptoms asking to be tested for Chinese coronavirus, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on Wednesday. According to the report, health officials, doctors, and journalists visiting Karachi hospitals are concerned over a shortage of testing kits and medical equipment, such as protective gear, to treat the country’s surging number of Chinese coronavirus cases, at press time 256. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan urged calm late Tuesday in an address to the nation. “There is no need to worry. We will fight this as a nation. And God-willing, we will win this war,” Khan said. Khan also discouraged unnecessary testing for Chinese coronavirus, as the nation struggles with a shortage of testing kits: “Only those with intense symptoms should go to the hospital.” Pakistan’s shortage of testing kits has led to a growing dispute between federal and provincial authorities. Local authorities blame the federal government not only for failure to provide sufficient Chinese coronavirus testing kits to the provinces but also for its responsibility in causing the surge in cases and need for more testing kits in the first place. Provincial authorities have criticized the federal government for failing to properly test and quarantine thousands of Pakistanis who recently returned to the country across a land border with Iran, the majority of whom were Muslim pilgrims visiting Islamic shrines in Iran. Some reports indicate that, despite the knowledge that closing its border with Iran would help stop the spread of Chinese coronavirus into Pakistan, the nation hesitated to close its border initially, fearing the negative impact such an action would have on Iran’s already dire economic circumstance. Close economic partners, Pakistan and Iran recently reaffirmed their trade ties at a joint border commission meeting in January. Pakistan’s delayed response to the Chinese coronavirus echoes the late reactions by Iran, Italy, and South Korea, all of whom were reluctant to cut ties with China due to close economic and political relationships. Pakistan also benefits from its relationship with China, as evidenced Tuesday at a meeting between the leaders of the two nations. Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and Pakistani President Arif Alvi met on Tuesday in Beijing to solidify their political and economic commitments to one another. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported Tuesday that Xi promised to aid Pakistan in its fight against the Wuhan coronavirus, pledging 300,000 face masks and 10,000 protective suits. Confoundingly, Alvi offered Wuhan coronavirus aid to China in return, despite the current frustration in his country at the shortage of medical supplies for his own people. The gesture recalled a similar move by South Korean President Moon Jae-in this year, in which he offered $5 million in Wuhan coronavirus aid to China, despite the need for the aid in his own country. At Tuesday’s meeting, Alvi and Jinping also signed two memorandums of understanding (MoU), one establishing joint technology and agriculture working groups in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Joint Cooperation Committee, and another on strengthening cooperation on pest and disease control between the two countries. The MoUs stem directly from Pakistan’s alignment with China as a member of its Belt and Road Initiative to consolidate power in Asia, Europe, and Africa. In a statement at the meeting, Xi said, “No matter how the international situation changes, China will always stand firmly with Pakistan, and is committed to deepening the ironclad China-Pakistan friendship, so as to make China-Pakistan relations a model for building a community with a shared future for humanity, and better benefit the two peoples.”",Pakistan: Mobs Fearing Chinese Coronavirus Flood Karachi Hospitals,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/18/pakistan-mobs-fearing-chinese-coronavirus-flood-karachi-hospitals/,Breitbart
"The Pentagon said Wednesday it was deploying its two 1,000-bed hospital ships at the direction of the president to assist with the nation’s coronavirus response. “As was announced by the president, the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy are being prepared for deployment as needed to assist potentially overwhelmed communities with acute patient care,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Rath Hoffman said at a briefing. He said the Comfort is intended to head to New York. He said since it is currently in maintenance in Norfolk, Virginia, the maintenance will be expedited but it will take at least a week to get it underway. “It’s going to be a little while,” he added. The Mercy, which is on the West Coast, will be “prepared and ready to go much sooner,” Hoffman said. He said the ship will be prepared to go in “days, not weeks.” He said the destination is to be determined. The ships will be used to take non-coronavirus patients in order to alleviate potential strain on hospital beds in civilian hospitals, said Joint Staff Surgeon Air Force Brig. Gen. (Dr.) Paul Fredrichs. Fredrichs said the Defense Department has 14 labs up and running, testing defense personnel for coronavirus. Almost 1,000 tests have been run. He said the department is soon expanding its ability to run tests for non-defense personnel as well. The Pentagon also has a number of field hospitals it can deploy to help alleviate the strain on civilian hospital beds that may be needed to respond to coronavirus. Fredrichs said the Air Force has expeditionary air medical systems that have 25 beds in them, and the Army has much larger combat support hospitals and field hospitals that can deploy by air and ground. He said in addition to the hospital ships, the Navy has expeditionary medical facilities that have 150 beds. Fredrichs said there is no specific requirement yet for beds in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo has asked for federal help to alleviate a potential hospital bed shortage. He said the Pentagon has “alerted” or is readying 1,000 field hospital beds.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Coronavirus: Pentagon Says Navy Hospital Ship to Head to New York City; Another Ready to Go,2020-03-18,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/18/coronavirus-pentagon-says-navy-hospital-ship-to-head-to-new-york-city-another-ready-to-go/,Breitbart
"The Senate passed a multibillion-dollar package Wednesday to confront the economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak. The Senate passed a House coronavirus aid package with overwhelming bipartisan support, with 90 senators in favor and eight against the measure. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)l, James Inhofe (R-OK), Ron Johnson (R-WI), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rand Paul (R-KY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Tim Scott (R-SC) voted against the bill. The House passed the legislation on Saturday, although Congress’s lower chamber had to pass a subsequent bill to address errors in the legislation. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) found that the bill will cost $104 billion. The House-passed bill is referred to as “phase two” of Congress’s and President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus package. The vote follows as Senate Republicans are working on “phase three,” which the Senate GOP hopes to pass next week. The third coronavirus package will likely include loans for small businesses, industries, and direct cash payments for Americans. Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD) said on Tuesday that there is a “high level of interest” from Senate Republicans to craft a bill that would give Americans cash payments to handle the coronavirus outbreak. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin negotiated the bill, which caused controversy as many Senate Republicans felt sidelined during the negotiations. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said that the Democrat bill is not perfect, but they will move to pass their own legislation that would further address the economic impact of the Wuhan virus. “I will vote to pass their bill. This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” McConnell said. “However, the House’s bill has real shortcomings. It does not even begin to cover all of the Americans who will need help in the days ahead,” the Senate Majority Leader added. Paul forced an amendment to the coronavirus package that would have offset the cost of the bill by ending the war in Afghanistan. “All because we refused to do what we were elected to do, which is to prioritize the truly vital, such as coronavirus relief and medical research, over the extraneous, such as spending money on clown colleges, gas stations, and roads in Afghanistan,” Paul said.

"As the commercial airline industry grounds itself and travel restrictions bite in the face of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, the private jet alternative is thriving thanks to the insatiable demands of the wealthy and the well-connected. According to AFP, the demand from the super rich has never been stronger. Richard Zaher, CEO of a U.S.-based private jet charter company, told the news service emails and phone calls just keep coming. “Inquiries have gone through the roof,” he told AFP, noting his company Paramount Business Jets had seen a 400 percent increase in queries, with bookings up roughly 20-25 percent. “It is completely coronavirus,” he added. “We are seeing our regular private jet clients flying as they normally do. However, we have this surge of clients coming our way and the majority of them have never flown private.” The reason for the demand is explained by the fact private flyers do not want to be confined with hundreds of people with “unknown” travel histories. Private passengers also clear customs and immigration separate from crowded main airport terminals, allowing them to move freely whether it be on a holiday trip or heading to a conference in distant places: Irony Alert: A Thousand Private Jets Deliver Globalist Elite to Davos for Climate Change Summit https://t.co/uWJxkxpVoJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 24, 2018  A spokeswoman for Air Charter Service in Hong Kong told AFP they had seen a 70 percent increase in fixed bookings from the financial hub, Shanghai, and Beijing in January and February, and had recorded a 170 percent jump in new customers during the same period. “It is the kind of people who are wealthy enough but who would not necessarily charter, who are maybe chartering as a one-off,” said James Royds-Jones, Air Charter Service’s director of executive jets for Asia Pacific. One recent booking involved a family moving from Hong Kong to the Thai city of Chiang Mai. “People are just trying to almost pack their house into a private jet,” he said. “Also relocating, I guess the one good thing about the private jet side of things… you can have your pets with you.” The Financial Times also records a surge in global bookings for private jet facilities, reporting Hong Kong international airport alone had its busiest day for private jet activity on record this week as wealthy residents of the territory and Chinese citizens rush back to the city before authorities imposed strict quarantine measures on new arrivals.

"Civil servants speaking to the establishment media have claimed that Boris Johnson’s government is preparing to extend the Brexit transition period beyond December 31st, 2020, due to disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The reports come as the government announced that full Brexit talks between London and Brussels have been put on hold, with the second round of negotiations scheduled to have begun on Wednesday. Last week it was announced that the face-to-face talks had been postponed, but it was expected that negotiations would continue over telephone or internet videoconferencing. Such methods have recently been employed by the United States, the EU, and other members of the G7 when they held an emergency summit via videoconference on Monday to discuss the response to the pandemic. Confirming talks would not be taking place in any format this week, a government spokesman told the BBC that both sides remain “fully committed to the negotiations” and that Johnson’s team is in talks with the European Commission over “the possibility of video conferencing or conference calls, and exploring flexibility in the structure in the coming weeks”. “We expect to share a draft FTA (Free Trade Agreement) alongside the draft legal texts of a number of the standalone agreements in the near future still, as planned,” the spokesman added. Brexit: Raab Rejects Transition Extension Because of Coronavirus https://t.co/leMxOR86Q6 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 18, 2020  Labour politicians are attempting to revive Project Fear for its third iteration, demanding that the date the UK leaves the EU’s rules and institutions be extended or the economy could suffer, with coronavirus compounding the “shock” of a “no-deal Brexit”. Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said that “if anything”, the pandemic demonstrates “the case for intensive diplomacy to get this deal done and move on and take the relationship [with the EU] to the next level”. The establishment media has also been trying to breathe life into Project Fear 3.0, by quoting “Whitehall” sources who portend that the government is preparing to delay the exit. “Whitehall” is often used to refer to the Civil Service, which has been accused in recent years of anti-Brexit bias and which has come to be known as Britain’s own Deep State. In a piece by the Remain-backing Financial Times entitled “Brexit Transition Deadline in Doubt as Talks Called off”, the financial newspaper reports that “Whitehall officials no longer believe the December 31 end date is set in stone”. The article continued: A well-placed person in Whitehall said that while a delay was “not the case politically”, that may change if disruption continued. “If we can’t continue talks properly then we are in a different world,” the person said. A spokesman for Boris Johnson told the FT that such claims were “not true”. Labour’s Nandy: UK ‘Must’ Extend Brexit Transition Period Because of Coronavirus https://t.co/sMVtTFSXdQ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 10, 2020  The Telegraph also said that “senior Whitehall sources” had told them that civil servants working on “no-deal” preparations have been moved onto coronavirus crisis management. The paper added: Although a final decision has yet to be made by Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, The Telegraph understands from highly-placed sources that the Government accepts it will need to seek an extension before the June deadline expires. A Downing Street source told the newspaper that it was “totally untrue” that an extension was being considered, and that “no conversations” are being had about it. A government spokesman said that alternatives to face-to-face negotiations are being considered, stating: “The transition period ends on December 31, 2020. This is enshrined in UK law.” Sufficient progress on a deal needs to be agreed by June — in the eventuality that both sides need to prepare for a ‘no deal’ scenario — but Mr Raab said in the Commons on Tuesday: “We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.” While Brexiteer Tory MP David Davis said: “We are aiming towards a comprehensive free trade agreement along the lines promised by Donald Tusk and entrenched in the political declaration. If we achieve that, there is no need for concern.” Asked whether the government is considering delaying the transition exit, Prime Minister Johnson said during Wednesday’s press conference: “There is legislation in place that I have no intention of changing.” The UK Has Made up Its Mind’: No 10 Hits Back at EU over Brexit Ultimatum, Will Publish Draft FTA Pact https://t.co/zBbZ4Masjs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 10, 2020 ","Civil Servants Stoke Project Fear 3.0, Claim Govt Preparing to Extend Brexit Transition over Coronavirus: Report",2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/19/civil-servants-claim-govt-preparing-extend-brexit-transition-coronavirus-report/,Breitbart
"Tens of thousands of Muslim faithful sparked an outcry in Bangladesh on Wednesday as they defied authorities to hold a mass public prayer gathering just as the South Asian nation reported its first death from the global pandemic. Local police chief Tota Miah said some 10,000 hard-line Muslims gathered in an open field in Raipur town in southern Bangladesh to pray “healing verses” from the Koran to rid the country of the deadly virus. Organisers claimed the number of worshippers was closer to 25,000 and acknowledged they did not get permission from authorities to hold the session. “They held the Khatme Shifa prayers after dawn to free the country from the coronavirus,” Miah told AFP. Authorities have already shut schools and asked locals to avoid large gatherings in an effort to halt the spread of the disease. “Unbelievable how they even have done it without notifying the police? They will be held responsible if anything happens to the people in the region,” Abdur Rahman wrote on Facebook. This is not the first time devout Muslims have defied authorities to continue their worship in crowded public places, many believing their faith makes them invincible in the face of the threat posed by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. As Breitbart News reported, the practice is increasingly common in Iran. Earlier this month online videos emerged showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they have no fear of infection during the Islamic republic’s escalating coronavirus outbreak: <span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> Touching and kissing surfaces in shrines is a common practice for Muslim pilgrims, and religious hardliners argue the holy sites of Qom are “a place for healing” that the government has no right to close down. Iran’s shrines draw Shiites from all over the Mideast for pilgrimages, likely contributing to the spread of the virus across the region. Saudi Arabia earlier closed off Islam’s holiest sites over fear of the virus spreading. President Hassan Rouhani said despite the closures, “our soul is closer to the saints more than at any time.” In Indonesia, a mosque in the capital Jakarta is still planning to hold Friday mass prayers despite warnings from the government to end public gatherings. A spokesman for the Istiqlal Mosque told local news agency Antara: “The mosque’s grand imam Nasaruddin Umar has instructed that the Friday mass prayer for this week will be held as usual following the Indonesian Ulama Council’s (MUI) decision.” AFP contributed to this story",Bangladesh Muslims Spark Outcry over Mass Chinese Coronavirus Prayers,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/faith/2020/03/19/bangladesh-muslims-spark-outcry-over-mass-chinese-coronavirus-prayers/,Breitbart
"NEW YORK (AP) — Faced with a lengthy shutdown due the coronavirus pandemic, movie theaters are requesting relief from the U.S. government. The National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), the trade group that represents most of the industry’s cinemas, said Wednesday that it’s asking for immediate federal help for its chains and its 150,000 employees. The theaters are requesting loan guarantees for exhibitors, tax benefits for employees and funds to compensate for lost ticket sales and concessions. The organization said the movie theater industry is “uniquely vulnerable” to the crisis, and needs assistance to weather a near total shutdown of two to three months. “This is an unprecedented challenge to the business,” said John Fithian, president and chief executive of NATO. “We’re looking to Congress and White House to understand this is a cultural institution where people gather.” A man jogs by a theatre posting sign of support on it’s marquis in a mostly empty San Francisco, California on March 17, 2020. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty) Fithian didn’t give a specific dollar amount for what the industry is seeking but said theaters could be saved for a fraction of what the airline industry is requesting (The White House has proposed $50 billion for the airlines). For less than the cost of one airline company, Fithian said, movie theaters could be kept afloat. “We want our policy makers to know that at the end of this thing, when people have been cooped up in their house for several months, they’ll need a break to go out and do something collectively that’s affordable and fun and away from what they’ve just been through,” he said. “But we still need to be viable.” NATO also said it will supply $1 million in aid for out-of-work movie theater employees. The majority of the industry’s workers are paid hourly. “Starting tomorrow, most of them won’t be paid anything,” said Fithian. Earlier this week, U.S. movie theaters closed nationwide, shuttering nearly all of the country’s cinemas including its largest chains, AMC Theaters and Regal Cinemas. The closures followed federal guidelines against gatherings of more than 10 people. Hollywood has postponed nearly all March and April releases, and many May ones, too. In the meantime, some studios have moved their new releases to on-demand platforms, a rare breaking of the traditional 90-day theatrical window.

On Wednesday, Sony Pictures said the Vin Diesel sci-fi thriller “Bloodshot,” which opened in theaters last Friday, will be available for digital purchase Tuesday. “Sony Pictures is firmly committed to theatrical exhibition and we support windowing,” Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman said in a statement. “This is a unique and exceedingly rare circumstance where theaters have been required to close nationwide for the greater good.”","Movie Theaters Request Stimulus from Trump, Congress Due to Coronavirus",2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/03/19/movie-theaters-request-stimulus-from-trump-congress-due-to-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Appearing Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s Hannity, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said the federal government should not provide assistance to Chinese-owned companies in the United States that face financial issues due to the outbreak of the coronavirus.  A partial transcript is as follows:  REP. MATT GAETZ: The Coronavirus is not a wedge issue and I would like to extend my heart to my colleague, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who just got diagnosed with Coronavirus and I certainly hope he has a rapid recovery. If I were Ilhan Omar, I certainly wouldn’t be making comments about other people destroying families. But if you check the scorecard, you can see that the president’s policies actually resulted in reduced human trafficking on the border because we actually got tough. That is not worth responding to. What certainly is is what Senator Cotton said about the relief package coming to Congress and my hope is that we don’t report companies that are owned, in part, by China or Chinese companies. Some of these hospitality and casino with other companies have Chinese ownership and our taxpayers shouldn’t go to bail out China.”",Matt Gaetz: Don’t Assist Chinese-Owned Companies in United States,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/matt-gaetz-dont-assist-chinese-owned-companies-in-united-states/,Breitbart
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday he wanted Congress to pass direct payments to American families suffering during the Chinese coronavirus crisis. “I refer to this as checks in the mail, but it’s really money directly deposited,” Mnuchin said, during an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. Mnuchin detailed a proposal to send $1000 to American adults and $500 per child — $3,000 for a family of four. “Soon as Congress passes this, we get this out in three weeks and then six weeks later if the president still has a national emergency, we’ll deliver another $3,000,” he said. The direct payments to Americans are part of a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus economic relief package proposed by President Donald Trump’s administration. “This is not going to go on forever, we are going to beat this, and while we are doing that, we understand, there are impacts on hardworking Americans and the president is determined that we are going to support them,” Mnuchin said. Mnuchin said $300 billion would be used for small businesses, helping them hire people and keep people on the payroll during the crisis, and repaying them with loan forgiveness. “That’s 40 percent of the private workforce and we want to keep those people employed,” he said.","Steven Mnuchin Pitches Direct Deposits of $1000 Per Person, $500 Per Child",2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/steven-mnuchin-pitches-direct-deposits-of-1000-per-person-500-per-child/,Breitbart
"MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough issued a stark warning on Thursday regarding the country’s health care system amid the coronavirus pandemic. Scarborough said there is a “very real possibility” the U.S. health care system “collapses” from being “overtaxed” and not having the proper amount of basic supplies. “We’re just in Act One of this,” Scarborough told co-host Mika Brzezinski. “Act Two is when the hospitals start to get jammed, Mika. When our health care professionals don’t have the supplies they need to keep them safe, then they go down. And the possibility, the very real possibility, I’m certainly not saying this to disturb anybody, but this is the reality we seem to be facing. [When] health care professionals don’t have the safety supplies they need, then our health care professionals go down, and then suddenly, an overtaxed emergency room and an overtaxed hospital, an overtaxed health care system collapses. So this situation, let’s hope the social distancing, let’s hope governments shutting down interaction between people, let’s hope that stops that emergency from coming.” “But again, there’s a three-week lag on everything that’s happening. So, I think even if we shut the country down tomorrow, or even if we shut the country down today, that three-week lag is still going to hit us. And it is going to be felt most acutely in the hospitals, in the emergency rooms, where we don’t have basic equipment,” he added.

"Politico founding editor John F. Harris has published a lengthy column in which he argues that the coronavirus marks the “end of Trumpism.” The pandemic marks “a new political epoch,” Harris argues, that “will last much longer than the crisis itself.” The major change, he says, will be an increased need to rely on scientific experts, who — he appears to presume — President Donald Trump and his followers do not trust, based on their opposition to the scientific consensus on climate change. The result, Harris says, is that “Trumpism” must retreat in the face of technocratic rule: One way to gauge the power of these currents—crisis fueled by frightening science—is by watching the change in President Donald Trump. There is no way to know for certain what the coronavirus means for his reelection. But already it is evident what it has meant for Trumpism. It has sent it hurtling into retreat. Trumpism as an idea is about promoting and protecting American sovereignty and singularity. In some contexts, even Trump foes might agree it’s an attractive concept: Well might we wish to seal our borders from the virus. But the only way this would be effective would be if the United States had years ago opted to adjourn from the modern interconnected global economy. Yes, the coronavirus first presented itself in China. How many people were surprised to learn only in the past few weeks that nearly all U.S. antibiotics also come from China. Trumpism as a style is defined not just by boasting and bluster; his triumphalism depends on projecting certitude. The president early on acted as if he could indeed create reality by proclamation, when he assured the public that U.S. infections would soon be down to zero. Only in recent days, as the possibility of widespread domestic disease mounts, has Trump acknowledged imprecision—the fragmentary nature of our understanding of how far the virus has spread, how effective efforts to blunt its impact will be, or when these efforts will be deemed sufficient. Harris concludes by suggesting that Trump’s “mockery and castigation of opponents” means that he cannot unite the country. Read the full column at Politico. Joel B.

"Health care workers  and truck drivers have already gotten their due here at The Breitbart-Dot-Com, and I would just like to add our grocery store workers to that list. Whether it is your local IGA, your local Ralph’s, or your local mega-Walmart, while Americans prepare to self-quarantine, prepare to binge Netflix from a Charmin throne, the people who unload the trucks and stock those increasingly empty shelves are putting themselves in harm’s way, are going above and beyond in an already tough job that just got a whole lot tougher … and dangerous. Heavy cartons. Cold refrigeration units. Endless numbers of boxes that need to be opened, unpacked, broken down, and tossed away. Endless shelves that must be restocked. Punishing hours of drudge work for low pay, and all while at risk of getting sick… We would be lost without these marvelous people, many of whom are seniors, i.e., those most at risk of the Wuhan coronavirus, who were looking for a few extra hours to supplement their social security, or to just get out of the house. Many of whom are students. It’s kind of sport now to point and laugh at Millennials and Generation Z-types who are out there defying orders to practice safe distancing, but let’s not forget the young people working the cash registers, unloading the trucks, or as I saw the other morning, helping a disabled homeless man in a wheelchair check out his breakfast of day old bread. These people are every bit as crucial to our supply chain as farmers and truck drivers, they are a vital part of that elite (yes, I said “elite”) group who keep our world turning. Over the past few days I’ve had the opportunity to talk to some grocery store managers and workers, and they tell me there’s a good spirit to go along with the extra work. “People are pulling together, there’s a sense of camaraderie, and a sense of serving the community,” one manager told me. “It’s exciting and unpredictable. But we’re pulling together to serve the community.” “We know a lot of the people who shop here. These are our neighbors,” he added. Our local Walmart was a 24-hour store, but as of last week it is now open only from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. But an associate told me the work still goes on 24 hours. “We still have three shifts and use the hours [we’re closed to the public] to keep the store clean. So no one’s losing hours. Associates are getting more hours, which they like.” The best news I heard is that people who have lost their jobs due to restaurant closings are finding jobs at Walmart. “We’re hiring people from the closed restaurants. They’re getting hours. We’re still looking for temps and regular employees, and everyone is happy to get the hours.” All of this matches what I have seen personally. On my most recent panic buying spree, I was all over one of our larger grocery stores. They had just opened. It was just after 6 a.m. and there were more employees filling shelves than customers. Morale looked good as they hustled to and fro, telling me “good morning” and greeting one another. You know, I’ve made this point before, but the reality of what we’re going makes it in ways no one can truly articulate. Let me use myself as an example… If I stopped doing what I do for a living tomorrow, some of you would miss me … for a while, and then you would move on. If everyone who does what I do for a living — punditry, columnists, commentary — disappeared tomorrow, some masochists people might miss cable news and the like, but you would eventually move on. Going even further… If everyone in the entertainment industry, everyone in sports and media, everyone who writes, catches a ball; every artist, painter, performer, director, producer, dancer, singer, songwriter, and poet disappeared tomorrow (and some have in this economic shutdown), we would miss them, we would miss the spice and seasoning of life, but we would move on… Life would go on. Now try to imagine life without someone unloading those trucks and stocking those store shelves… You can’t. Because without them it’s anarchy. Many of the people who keep our world turning are the working class… The woman shivering in the refrigeration unit as she fills the milk rack, the truck driver who spends days and days away from his family, the plumbers and electricians and janitors and road workers and farmers and exterminators and  office cleaners and ditch diggers. And the grocery store workers. No grocery store workers, no supply chain. No supply chain, no civilization. Godspeed to everyone out there keeping our world turning.

"The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator has self-isolated after being diagnosed with the Chinese coronavirus, making the chances of the presently suspended Brexit negotiations continuing in the near future more remote. Posting to social media to announce his self-isolation on Thursday, Mr Barnier, 69, said that he was “fine” and in good spirits and following the medical advice after his coronavirus diagnosis. Michel Barnier has led the European Union’s Brexit negotiation team since 2016, and has frequently met with his opposite number, British lead negotiator David Frost, 55. Barnier has consistently played “hard-ball” with the United Kingdom, repeatedly making clear he regrets Brexit and expressing his desire for the country to either not depart or return in the future. His hard line pronouncements haven’t always proven correct in reality, however. In light of Prime Minister Theresa May standing down as Prime Minister in 2019, Mr Barnier said the agreement she’d signed with Europe — which was very advantageous to Brussels — couldn’t be renegotiated by a subsequent Prime Minister. That later proved to be incorrect.   Je tiens à vous informer que j'ai été testé positif #COVID19. Je vais bien, le moral est bon. Je suis naturellement toutes les instructions, tout comme mon équipe. Mon message à tous ceux qui sont touchés ou actuellement isolés: nous nous en sortirons ensemble !. #chacunpourtous pic.twitter.com/NxMCjfseSb — Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) March 19, 2020  The European Union’s present position, as articulated by Mr Barnier, is that the United Kingdom cannot leave the bloc in any meaningful sense unless it agrees to continue accepting EU rules and regulations. The position makes the British leaving on “no deal” terms more likely, as continuing to be subject to EU laws and courts would be regarded as a betrayal of the spirit of the 2016 referendum by Brexiteers. Negotiations were due to resume this week on Wednesday, but were delayed as negotiators were unable to travel and meet in person. It had been announced that talks were to continue through teleconferencing and Internet facilities, but this does not seem to have yet happened. A British government spokesman said that they nontheless remained “fully committed to the negotiations” and that talks were ongoing about “the possibility of video conferencing or conference calls, and exploring flexibility in the structure in the coming weeks.” “We expect to share a draft FTA (Free Trade Agreement) alongside the draft legal texts of a number of the standalone agreements in the near future still, as planned”, the spokesman, in comments reported by Breitbart London on Thursday. Barnier Warns UK Must Stick by EU Regulations to Get a Post-Brexit Deal https://t.co/ZkoHYeKZbe — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 23, 2019  Anti-Brexiteers on the British political scene have been quick to grab on to coronavirus as the latest pretext to prevent or slow the United Kingdom breeaking away from the European Union. While the government has repeatedly expressed its desire to push on with Britain leaving the European Union at the end of this year, as promised to the British people, leading figures in the Labour party have demanded an extension to the ongoing Brexit-in-name-only transition period be sought immediately. After days of rumours, the Prime Minister addressed the claims head-on on Wednesday afternoon at the regular coronavirus press conference, telling the press: “it’s not a subject that’s being regularly discussed, I can tell you, in Downing Street at the moment… There is legislation in place that I have no intention of changing” — a reference to the Brexit law passed in January which set the December 31st, 2020 end date of the transition period.

"Transport for London (TfL) has announced that up to 40 stations on the London Underground will be closed to curtail travel in an effort to halt the spread of coronavirus. The night tube and bus services will also be reduced in the capital, where it is spreading faster than in any other part of the country. Other public transport services will also be on limited services, including the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), TfL Rail, London Overground, and the south London Tram network. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked Britons to self-isolate and work from home if possible. However, one key worker commuting on the Underground told the BBC that it seemed “a lot busier” on the Tubes than earlier in the week, saying: “It didn’t feel like people were staying at home.” There have been 900 confirmed cases of the China-origin virus in London, with fatalities in the capital reaching 34. The virus’s spread in the city is weeks ahead of other parts of the country, and on Wednesday night, Prime Minister Johnson would not rule out enforcing a curfew on Londoners, putting the city into lockdown. Pics: Empty Streets of London as Government Considers Enforcing City Shutdown https://t.co/dYHp4i5K2y — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 19, 2020  The government is preparing to pass emergency legislation on coronavirus which includes increasing police powers to detain those suspected of having the virus who refuse testing or isolation, as well as the power to shut down venues for public safety. Recent reports have suggested that London could go into lockdown by this weekend. One source close to London Mayor Sadiq Khan told The Telegraph in a report published on Wednesday: “We expect a shutdown of London, but nobody in central Government is saying when that will be or what form it will take.” Mr Johnson is set to chair another meeting of the national emergency COBRA meeting on Thursday to discuss proposals amidst concerns that people in London are not following the government’s advice, reports The Times. Such measures could include forcing pubs, cafes, and restaurants to close. “This is not about arresting people on the street,” a government source told the newspaper of record. “This is about some simple measures to ensure that the current public health guidance is followed.” On Thursday morning, however, a government spokesman told media that there is “zero prospect” of restrictions being put on travel in and out of London. “There are no plans to close down the transport network in London and there is zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of London,” the spokesman said. Aside from TfL’s decision to shut some 40 stations, the government also said that it would not forcibly shut down London’s public transport system.

"Another batch of celebrities, including actor Kevin Bacon, are urging their fans and followers — including the spring breakers who flocked to the beaches in South Florida despite official orders — to practice social distancing and “stay at home” in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus. “Hi folks. You know me, right? I’m technically only six degrees away from you,” the Footloose star said in a PSA. “Right now like people all around the world, I’m staying home because it saves lives and is the only way we’re going to slow down the spread of this coronavirus. Because the contact that you make with someone who makes contact with someone else, that may be what makes somebody’s mom or grandpa or wife sick.” “Everyone one of us has someone who is worth staying home for. And I am staying home for Kyra Sedgwick,” he said, holding up a sign. He ultimately urged followers to post who they are staying home for, using the hashtag #IStayHomeFor. “We can work together to stay home and keep each other safe and spread the word,” he added.

He urged people, including the spring breakers who have flocked to Florida beaches in recent days, to stay away from crowds, “All the kids going to the beach and celebrate and all that stuff, this is not a good idea,” The Terminator actor said. “So stay away from the crowds, go home, and then we can overcome this whole problem, this whole virus, in no time. But you got to go and follow those orders.” “Just remember, stay at home,” he added. Stay. At. Home.

One spring breaker, Brady Sluder, further demonstrated the generational divide. “If I get corona, I get corona,” Sluder said. “At the end of the day, I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying. You know, I’ve been waiting, we’ve been waiting for Miami spring break for a while, about two months we’ve had this trip planned.” Another spring breaker, Brianna Leeder, said the response to the coronavirus — the bar and beach closures and restrictions, specifically — were “really messing up with my spring break.” “I think they’re blowing it way out of proportion,” she added. “If I get corona, I get corona.

"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday censored the word “Chinese” in President Trump’s tweet on the coronavirus. Trump on Wednesday defended his decision to sign the Defense Production Act to “combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.” “Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!” the president wrote: I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.

CNN, for example, used the exact word the president used — “Chinese” — to describe the virus in a January article: A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected more than 200 people since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans. https://t.co/mnZKFC5ZDW — CNN (@CNN) January 21, 2020  What is more, the outlet also used the phrase “Wuhan coronavirus” eight times throughout the piece. Trump, however, has continued to defend his use of his descriptor. Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?” ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega asked the president on Wednesday. “Why do you keep using this?” she said, adding that “A lot of people say it’s racist.” “It’s not racist at all,” Trump stated. “No, it comes from China – that’s why I want to be accurate.”

"Twitter is responding to the Chinese coronavirus by banning jokes about it. In a post published on the site’s official blog earlier today, Twitter said that “description of treatments or protective measures which are not immediately harmful but are known to be ineffective, are not applicable to the COVID-19 context, or are being shared with the intent to mislead others, even if made in jest.” (emphasis ours) Examples used by Twitter include “coronavirus is not heat-resistant — walking outside is enough to disinfect you” or “use aromatherapy and essential oils to prevent COVID-19.” Twitter will also ban a range of other posts related to the coronavirus, including: Twitter said it is “broadening our definition of harm to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information.” “Rather than reports, we will enforce this in close coordination with trusted partners, including public health authorities and governments.” It also said it will expand the use of “machine learning and automation” in its efforts to tackle the newly-banned content. A bug in Facebook’s spam detection systems recently caused links to legitimate news stories about the coronavirus to be blocked across the site. In an apparent acknowledgment of the limitations of machine learning, Twitter said: “while we work to ensure our systems are consistent, they can sometimes lack the context that our teams bring, and this may result in us making mistakes.” “As a result, we will not permanently suspend any accounts based solely on our automated enforcement systems.” Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.",Twitter: Tell the Wrong Coronavirus Joke and We’ll Ban You,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/03/19/twitter-tell-the-wrong-coronavirus-joke-and-well-ban-you/,Breitbart
"Despite guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about social distancing to help combat the spread of the coronavirus, many spring breakers have been seen partying at beaches. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on Thursday announced that the “party’s over in Florida” because many of the state’s beaches and bars are now closed. “The message, I think, for spring breakers is that the party’s over in Florida,” DeSantis told “Fox & Friends.” “You’re not going to be able to congregate at any beach in the state. Many of the hotspots that people like to go to, whether it’s Miami Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, Clearwater Beach, are closed entirely for the time being. the bars are closed so you’re not going to have a place to congregate there.” He continued, “So we would just tell those folks maybe come back next year when things are better, but that is not what we are looking for here in the state of Florida.

"First lady Melania Trump will appear in public health PSAs encouraging proper hygiene, and CNN contributor and Never Trump leader Rick Wilson seemingly wished a coronavirus affliction upon her. #BeInfected https://t.co/TZD35uaEvq — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) March 19, 2020  Wilson, a “Republican” campaign consultant, shared a CNN article detailing the first lady’s campaign: First lady Melania Trump will appear in public service announcements on coronavirus set to be broadcast nationally, according to a news release sent late Wednesday afternoon from the White House. The PSAs will address the “important ways Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk” from contracting and spreading the coronavirus, according to the release. Trump’s lead initiative during her time in the White House has been the “Be Best” campaign, which encourages young people to treat one another better. “I think this would be a great time to remind Americans about the ‘Be Best’ campaign,” Katherine Jellison, a professor of history at Ohio University, told CNN. “She could remind the public, especially youngsters, that in times of stress, kind words to one another are a national duty. Especially at a time when family members are by necessity spending more time with one another, the best thing that everyone can do is be nice to one another.” CNN contributor and Never Trumper Wilson mocked that campaign and, instead, seemingly wished illness upon the first lady. “#BeInfected,” he contributed to the public discourse.

"On Thursday’s “Hugh Hewitt Show,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) discussed the coronavirus relief bill the Senate is working on and stated that the package is designed to provide loans to small businesses, that “will surely be forgiven” if those businesses maintain employment, and there is a package to help larger businesses. Romney said, “[T]his rescue package that we’re working on in the Senate is designed to provide funding to any business of 500 employees and smaller, all right? So, people can go to their local bank. It’ll be an SBA-guaranteed loan. The loan will surely be forgiven down the road, if people maintain their employment.” He added that “one of the packages is designed to help larger enterprises, and that’s the one that I mentioned with regards to airlines. It actually will have a facility a great deal larger than just what’s needed for airlines. It will be administered by the Treasury Department. And it’ll be for those enterprises that are larger, that are in difficult circumstances. How many will qualify is a real question.

"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) on Thursday dropped out of the Democrat presidential primary race and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. Gabbard’s departure comes after clinching just two delegates from American Samoa’s caucuses and failing to qualify for any debates this year. The Hawaii Democrat, who resigned as Democrat National Committee (DNC) vice chairwoman to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) White House campaign in 2016, opted this time around to back Biden, despite her anti-establishment leanings. “After Tuesday’s election, it is clear that Democratic Primary voters have chosen Vice President Joe Biden to be the person who will take on President Trump in the general election,” Gabbard said in a video shared to Twitter.

In October, Hillary Clinton appeared on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign manager, in which she appears to suggest that the congresswoman was an asset of the Kremlin. “[Russia] has a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting [Gabbard] so far. That’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset,” Clinton mused. “They know they can’t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it’s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.” In January, Gabbard filed a lawsuit against Clinton over her remarks, alleging that the former secretary of state “smeared” her “political and personal reputation.” Gabbard voted “present” on President Donald Trump’s impeachment in December, breaking with the overwhelming majority of her House Democrat colleagues.","Tulsi Gabbard Drops Out of Presidential Race, Endorses Joe Biden",2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/tulsi-gabbard-drops-out-of-presidential-race-endorses-joe-biden/,Breitbart
"Sen. Lindsey Graham is using the coronavirus recovery bills to dramatically expand the award of EB-5 green cards to wealthy Chinese if they lend money to U.S. real estate investors and other companies, according to several activists and Politico magazine. “How can people pushing this not see how politically explosive this is?” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “An EB-5 increase would almost exclusively benefit Chinese: It is hard to imagine what they are thinking.” The plan by Graham, (R-S.C.) was provided to Politico, which said it would “boost the number of [EB-5] visas offered to wealthy immigrants who invest money in the United States as it tries to boost a faltering economy amid the escalating coronavirus outbreak, according to four people familiar with the situation.” The Politico report added: The proposal, which could be included in one of the Senate’s coronavirus rescue bills, would significantly boost the number of visas offered annually from 10,000 to 75,000 while halving the investment required to earn legal residence from $900,000 to $450,000, they say. Half the recipients of the EB-5 visa program — investors and their families — come from China, according to a report by the Brookings Institution think tank. Many others come from South Korea and Taiwan. Breitbart News asked Graham’s office for comment. The office responded by saying, “Check with the Majority Leader’s office. He is handling the package and what will/will not be included.” Immigration reformers say they are astounded by Graham’s apparent willingness to have the GOP portray itself as covertly selling fast-track citizenship to wealthy Chinese migrants amid the mounting human toll and economic cost caused by China’s coronavirus. “It is appalling – it is not even like in any tangential way related to the crisis we’re in,” Krikorian said, adding, “anybody who signs on to this is going to get some of the splatter.” “Why on earth would they be going down this path? Who is telling them this is a good idea?” said Preston Huennekens, a lobbyist at the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Trump’s deputies reformed the EB-5 program in 2019 to cut corruption and to spread the spending outside coastal cities, he said, so any walk back would be really alarming, he said. Instead of a serious push, “I hope it is a play” just to get political donations from the investment groups, said one source. GOP leaders seem to be resisting special interest grabs by GOP and Democrat legislators. “The goal here is to deal with this emergency created by this epidemic,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said March 17. “Anything that doesn’t address that pandemic to me should not be considered.” The Graham amendment would expand the EB-5 program, which awards EB-5 green cards and the promise of citizenship to foreign investors who lend money to private U.S. companies. The program is widely used in the real-estate sector by investors to raise construction funds. The program is often described as a citizenship-for-loans scheme, in which American citizens are forced to share their citizenship with the wealthy foreign families who lend their money to wealthy American investors. The EB-5 program has been a boon to the real estate investors who use it to raise funds for new construction in prosperous coastal cities from wealthy Chinese and Indians who want green cards. But the program is so scandal-prone that Trump’s Department of Homeland Security imposed a major rewrite in 2019. The rewrite forces lenders to lend twice as much money and pressures them to lend their money to poorer communities outside the major coastal centers. The EB-5 program is largely blocked because EB-5 groups have already sold far more offers of citizenship to their Chinese lenders than the government can fulfill during the next 15 years.  The EB-5 groups have tried to loosen their China backlog — and restart the sale of green cards to Chinese lenders — by passing a law which removes the long-standing “country caps” that preserve diversity in the annual awards of green cards. The bill to remove the “country caps” is being pushed by Sen. Mike Lee, (R-Utah) supposedly on behalf of roughly 300,000 backlogged Indian contract workers who have been imported by American CEOs and investors. Lee’s bill, numbered S.386, has stalled because of the widespread opposition from both parties, from the Americans professionals who lose jobs to the Indian visa workers, from foreign graduates who would be pushed to the back of the line, and by Senators with large dairy industries. The 300,000 Indian workers took jobs held by Americans professionals in the expectation they would be rewarded green cards. But because so many Indians choose to take jobs from American graduates, they have created a multi-year backup in the government’s line for green cards. The Indian visa-workers are now demanding that the “country caps” be removed so they can get the cards ahead of people from other nations.

"Public mistrust of the media had increased America’s vulnerability to the coronavirus outbreak, argued Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a group discussion on the latest episode of Politicon’s How the Heck Are We Gonna Get Along podcast. Host Clay Aiken asked, “Should we trust the media on COVID-19? Are we in a place where we are confident … that the media is presenting this in the most straightforward and honest way?” Pollak replied, “I think when we look back at this time, we’re going to see that the media created a vulnerability in our society to precisely this kind of threat.” As an example, Pollak offered the media’s obsession with “Russia collusion.” “You have a dominant story that’s been out there for three [or] four years that the president colluded with Russia to steal the election — more or less, some variation on that — and that turned out to be substantially untrue.” Pollak continued, “You can take one side or the other of the impeachment argument — I’m not here to relitigate that — but I’m just saying that for many Americans who simply made a choice on November 8th, 2016, they’ve watched their choice being described as some sort of foreign conspiracy, and that has contributed to a level of mistrust of the media that I think made people distrustful of [other] information they were receiving.” Congress’s focus on the impeachment of Trump across January and February came at the expense of political efforts to respond to the coronavirus outbreak during the viral spread’s early stages, Pollak noted. “If all of us could have January and February back, I think we would,” said Pollak. “If you think back to that time, at the time when our government could have been taking more drastic action, not only were politicians focused on impeachment primarily, but our media were simply looking in a different direction.” Pollak went on, “That’s not a Fox [News] problem, and it’s not even an MSNBC problem. We have a problem where we have become so heedless of what the purpose of media, at least in political coverage, ought to be that we actually made ourselves vulnerable to a threat that requires trust.” Conservative audiences are suspicious of many news media narratives, explained Pollak. “The suspicion among many in the conservative audience was that this was being done to bring down the president because it was almost made-to-order for an election year,” determined Pollak. “Now, that is not true, but that’s how people felt.” Adam Carolla elaborated on Pollak’s comments on conservative audiences.  “When you’re of a more conservative persuasion you voted for Trump, you feel like the news media was taking him down — or attempting to take him down — over the last three years,” said Carolla, “and when this thing [coronavirus] comes around, everyone who watches Fox goes, ‘Oh here we go again. Here’s the next thing.'” Carolla concluded, “So I think the news media, in a way, cried wolf a little too often, and got people thinking this is the next wolf — and it turned out this was actually a wolf.” Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.",Breitbart News’ Joel Pollak: Media Mistrust Made Society More Vulnerable to Coronavirus Outbreak,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/breitbart-news-joel-pollak-politicon-media-mistrust-made-society-more-vulnerable-to-coronavirus-outbreak/,Breitbart
"A traditional large family dinner turned deadly for a New Jersey family as the coronavirus spread after the gathering— matriarch Grace Fusco, 73, died on Wednesday after her two eldest children died earlier. Fusco’s eldest child, Rita Fusco-Jackson, 55, of Freehold, N.J., died Friday; Fusco’s eldest son, Carmine Fusco, of Bath, Pa., died on Wednesday, Paradiso Fodera, the family’s lawyer who is Fusco’s cousin and is serving as a spokeswoman, said in the New York Times report. Four more of Fusco’s children with the coronavirus remain hospitalized, three of them in critical condition, Fodera said. “A party to most people was a regular dinner to them,” Fodera said, adding Grace Fusco had 27 grandchildren. The New York Times reported on the large family with roots in the local horse racing industry: Nearly 20 other relatives are quarantined at their homes, praying in isolated solitude, unable to mourn their deep collective loss together. But the virus’s devastating toll on a single family is considered as rare as it is perplexing. “They’re young and they don’t have any underlying conditions,” Fodera said. The family has deep ties to the horse-racing industry near Freehold Raceway. Some trained horses. Others raced them. The children’s father, Vincenzo L. Fusco, did both, according to his obituary. A person who had contact with a man who died in New Jersey on March 10, becoming the state’s first coronavirus-related fatality, had attended a recent Fusco family gathering, the state’s health commissioner, Judith M. Persichilli, has said. According to a New York Times database,  five New Jersey residents have died from the virus which has infected an estimated 427 people in the state.

"Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) speculated without evidence Wednesday that President Donald Trump could exploit the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak to push back the 2020 presidential election. “My concern is that in the age of Trump that other governors might think, or that the president might ask, for a delay in the November election based on something, perhaps this, perhaps something else,” Brown told reporters on the subject of Ohio halting its Tuesday presidential primary election, according to the Columbus Dispatch. “I wish they had done this earlier. I think they could have done this on Friday. He’s in the arena doing this, I’m not,” Brown added, referencing Gov. Mike DeWine (R). “I’m not super critical of him. I just wish they had done this earlier.” Hours before the state’s primary, Gov. DeWine urged polls to close and reschedule the election to June 2. “We should not force them to make this choice, the choice between their health and their constitutional rights and duties,” DeWine said at a press conference Monday. Arizona, Florida, and Illinois went ahead with their primary elections. Former Vice President Joe Biden won all three states. Brown also voiced support for using a “national vote-by-mail system” for November’s election, echoing calls made by failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the Arizona Democrat Caucus.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that there will be no extension of the Brexit transition period because of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Negotiators announced earlier this week that planned face-to-face talks in London would be postponed whilst alternatives, including telephone and videoconferencing, would be explored. When asked during Wednesday’s coronavirus press conference whether there were any plans to delay the UK’s exit from Brussels’ institutions and rules, Prime Minister Johnson said: “It’s not a subject that’s being regularly discussed, I can tell you, in Downing Street at the moment.” “There is legislation in place that I have no intention of changing,” he stated in reference to the Brexit law passed in January which makes it illegal to extend the transition period beyond December 31st, 2020. The remarks came after Labour Party figures called for the deadline to be extended because of coronavirus, and after civil servants have been briefing to the media against government policy by claiming that Boris Johnson’s government is considering delaying the exit. Civil Servants Stoke Project Fear 3.0, Claim Govt Preparing to Extend Brexit Transition over Coronavirus: Report https://t.co/F4i1Dfm1Nt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 19, 2020  Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, foreign secretary Dominic Raab denied that extending the transition period was being discussed and rejected the notion that it should be. “If anything”, Mr Raab said, the coronavirus crisis demonstrates “the case for intensive diplomacy to get this deal done and move on and take the relationship [with the EU] to the next level”. “We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need,” he added. Former Brexit Party Member of European Parliament Ben Habib believes that coronavirus could, in fact, “strengthen[] the UK’s hand in negotiations”. Writing in The Telegraph, Mr Habib, who is the chairman of Brexit Watch and has a background in business, said it would be “ridiculous” to believe that the government’s attention is so consumed by coronavirus that it cannot fulfil the Conservatives’ primary manifesto pledge to deliver on the vote of the British people from nearly four years ago. “The Prime Minister himself is on the record saying that he would rather be dead in a ditch than not leave the EU. In the absence of finding a suitably sized ditch, he must not fail to fulfil the contract he entered into with the British people on 12 December 2019,” Mr Habib wrote. Police Could Detain Britons Who Refuse Coronavirus Test Under Emergency Law https://t.co/qSJYQaIJGY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 18, 2020  He continued that “Actually, as awful as the virus is, it strengthens the UK’s hand in negotiations,” saying that while both the EU and UK will be affected by the pandemic, the UK is in a far better position than the eurozone, with debt levels and unemployment rising in countries like Germany. Part of the reason for Britain’s survival is that the country retains its own currency and thus it is easier for the Bank of England to “inject the necessary stimulus when required”, unlike the European Central Bank, which Mr Habib has observed is yet to cut interest rates. “The EU is now in no position to do anything but to give the UK a good trade deal and cease its ridiculous demands for the UK to remain locked into a level playing field with its restrictive burdensome regulatory set up. We must press home this advantage. We should not shamelessly exploit it to the detriment of Europe but we must use it to get a Canada style free trade deal,” he wrote. He also warned that seeking an extension would be disastrous for negotiations as it would signal to the EU that the country is not prepared to leave without a deal, and as a result will do “irreparable damage in the negotiations”.",Coronavirus: Boris Says No to Brexit Extension,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/19/coronavirus-boris-says-no-brexit-extension/,Breitbart

"Thursday, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) called on spring breakers to congregating on Florida’s beaches in mass quantities to get off of the beach and not put lives at risk regarding the outbreak of the coronavirus. “[W]ith regard to the beaches, get off the beach,” he said. “I mean, unless you can figure out how to completely be isolated from anybody else, I mean, this is — individuals have to take responsibility, and every level of government has got to be very clear. Don’t be on the beach unless you can be somehow be completely by yourself. I mean, we’ve got to figure out the social distancing.” “But I think whether it’s the beaches, wherever we are, every part of government has got to start telling people, take some personal responsibility here,” Scott continued. “Don’t infect other people. Don’t take a chance that you’re going to be the one that causes your grandparents or your parents or another friend from school to get sick.” When asked if the beaches in Florida should be closed, Scott said there was a way to walk on the beach to avoid people but said that was lacking. “I mean, look, I don’t have all the same information that other people have,” Scott said. “There’s a way you can walk on the beach by yourself. But it’s not what’s happening. So whatever they have to do, they’ve got to stop all those individuals from going to the beach because there’s a chance that somebody is going to be down there with coronavirus and how many people are they going to infect.” “So you can see — you go back to what happened to South Korea, that one individual they said that went to a variety of churches, the one who infected — caused more infection of more than a thousand people,” he continued. “So, you’ve got to figure out how to figure out to get these people off the beach.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","FL Sen.

"TEL AVIV – In an unlikely show of camaraderie, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and main rival Blue and White head Benny Gantz shared an affectionate moment on social media over a coronavirus post, prompting reluctant umpire President Reuven Rivlin to urge the two party heads to continue the solidarity offline as well.  Gantz on Tuesday shared a post written by Netanyahu regarding new restrictions for staying at home. “When it comes to people’s lives, there’s no politics. Israel comes before everything. Protect yourselves and your families and fully obey instructions,” Gantz wrote. Netanyahu then shared Gantz’s own share, with the accompanying text, “Very important. Thanks, Benny.” Rivlin then shared the share chain and added, “Maybe we can continue with this at the cabinet table, friends?”  Rivlin called on Knesset speaker Yuli Edelstein to open the Knesset plenum and allow for MKs to debate setting up committees. Edelstein closed the plenary over fighting regarding the committees only two days after the 23rd Knesset was sworn in. “A frozen Knesset harms Israel’s ability to act in a good and responsible way during an emergency,” Rivlin told Edelstein. “We cannot let this crisis, as bad as it is, harm the infrastructure of our democratic system. We need to do everything to deal with this crisis, but carefully, in order not to strike a fatal blow to our democratic infrastructure,” he added. Gantz said he would petition the High Court of Justice over Edelstein’s decision. “We have been working hard all day through different communication channels — including me meeting personally with MK Edelstein, who is refusing to let us congregate in the halls of democracy and work for the citizens and — above all else — tackle the challenge of corona,” Gantz said. “At this point — we have no choice but to turn to the Supreme Court,” he added. Edelstein blamed the Blue and White party for not agreeing to any of the terms for the committees and said the plenum would reopen Monday after negotiations. He said he would allow the plenum to vote Monday on establishing an Arrangements Committee to begin parliamentary work. Blue and White’s leaders were behaving “ridiculously,” Edelstein said. A day earlier, Blue and White number 2, Yair Lapid, said the new coronavirus restrictions proved that Israel was “no longer a democracy.” Lapid blasted the government’s use of digital tracking tools from cellphone data which Netanyahu said would be used to monitor the spread of the virus. “It’s possible that it doesn’t really interest you with all this coronavirus in the air, but as of today, you no longer live in a democracy,” Lapid said in a video posted to social media. Lapid came under fire for his remarks, prompting him to post on Twitter Wednesday that “the instruction [not] to leave home is not the problem; the fact that it is given by an illegitimate government is definitely a problem.”  ","Under Virus, Netanyahu and Bitter Rival Gantz Enjoy Fleeting Moment of Solidarity",2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/19/under-virus-netanyahu-and-main-rival-gantz-enjoy-fleeting-moment-of-solidarity/,Breitbart
"TEL AVIV – Israel will instate “drive-thru” COVID-19 testing stations on Wednesday that will allow 6,000 Israelis to be tested daily, the country’s emergency service Magen David Adom said Tuesday. Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chaired a meeting at his office in Jerusalem to discuss expanding the number of coronavirus tests conducted and adding more testing methods. The meeting was attended by Health Minister Yaakov Litzman, National Security Council head Meir Ben-Shabbat, Health Ministry Director General Moshe Bar Siman, among others. The first drive-thru stations will be opened in Tel Aviv and will be followed by five more in Haifa, Jerusalem, Petah Tikva, Rishon Lezion and Beersheba. They will operate 24 hours a day in open areas to allow for a continuous stream of vehicles to enter and exit, MDA said. Until now, only 7,000 tests have been performed. The stations will require a referral from a physician in order to carry out the test. People who are in quarantine will be able to be tested at home. Staff will be in full protective gear, MDA said. The news of the drive-thrus came as new restrictions were rolled out in the country, amounting to a near lockdown. Citizens were told to avoid going outside unless “absolutely necessary” in a bid to combat the novel coronavirus. Health Ministry director-general Moshe Bar Siman Tov warned Israelis that “anywhere you go there could be a person with coronavirus.” “Do not leave your home,” he said in a directive. “Only to go to work or to purchase essential items, such as groceries, medicine and the like.” Parks, beaches, pools, nature reserves, libraries and museums are now prohibited as well as all social interactions.

I understand that the children need open spaces and that you parents also need some breathing room. But, nevertheless, we must not turn these days into leisure days… The danger is real!” he said. “I hear that our beaches and hiking trails are bursting. The danger is real!

Patience and deep breaths – this is our spirit, and if we keep it up, it will keep us strong,” he added.

Essential services will continue as usual, including supermarkets and pharmacies. These measures would be in place until after Passover. Netanyahu also said digital tracking means to follow people who have the virus would be implemented. “The government will approve emergency regulations tonight that will allow the use of digital means for the war on coronavirus. These measures will help us monitor and stop the virus. We agreed to ensure strict oversight of this measure so it is not abused. The attorney general [Avichai Mandelblit] answered our request and tonight we authorize the use of digital means for a limited period of 30 days,” Netanyahu said. Netanyahu added Israel will not have a broad lockdown, but added specific towns and areas with high numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases may be closed off. “We are not announcing a general closure and hope we won’t come to that, but we will implement a local lockdown where there is an outbreak so that we can stop it,” Netanyahu said. “The fight against coronavirus continues all the time. Our hearts are with Italy and Spain. Thank God we have a more mild increase in morbidity and we are doing everything to keep it under control,” Netanyahu said. Regarding the private sector, companies with 10 or fewer employees would be allowed to go about their business as usual, on the condition that people stick to the two-meters-apart “social distancing” rule. “Every CEO will decide as of Wednesday morning which employees are on early leave and who are not, and the decision includes local government,” Netanyahu said.

"Amid the rush for guns and ammo sales, a store owner in Arizona told Breitbart News the buying surge surpasses even the tremendous run witnessed during the post-Sandy Hook gun control push. The store owner said, “We’ve never seen anything like this.” He specifically described the sales surge as eclipsing what his store witnessed in January 2013, a time when Joe Biden was pushing numerous post-Sandy Hook gun controls for Barack Obama. During the day, his sales team waited on customers while lines formed full of more customers waiting to be next. Gun after gun after gun was sold. Scottsdale, Arizona’s Scottsdale Gun Club told a similar story, and Riverfields, Amarillo, Texas, described a flurry of buyers as well. On March 18, 2020, Breitbart News reported Colorado gun sales jumped 100 percent last week alone.  KDVR reported 14,000 firearms were sold in the state last week, which is a 100 percent increase over the 7,000 that were sold in that same week one year ago. The Hill reports a national surge in gun sales as well. They suggest the surge began in the states that were most effected by the Chinese coronavirus–Washington, California, New York–then swept through the rest of the country from there.

"The world economy is collapsing because of the terror and mounting death toll caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. But the anti-malarial drug chloroquine is effective both as a prophylactic and treatment for the virus – and the medical establishment has known about this since at least the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2005. What the hell is going on? Yesterday, I reported the existence of three studies, all claiming that chloroquine phosphate had proved effective in treating the COVID-19. This has since been confirmed by a more recent open-label non-randomised clinical trial in France by Didier Raoult​ M.D/Ph.D et al, completed just days ago. The sample was small but the results were convincing. As the summary reports: 100% of patients that received a combination of HCQ and Azithromycin tested negative and were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. In addition, recent guidelines from South Korea and China report that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are effective antiviral therapeutic treatments for novel coronavirus. But the story gets more extraordinary still. It turns out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has known since at least 2005 that chloroquine is effective against coronaviruses. In 2005, Martin J Vincent et al published a study in Virology Journal titled ‘Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.’ Here are its findings: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds. It ought to be no surprise that chloroquine is effective against both SARS and COVID-19. After all, they are both coronaviruses and COVID-19 has often been described in medical and research sources as SARS-2. Chloroquine works by enabling the body’s cells better to absorb zinc, which is key in preventing viral RNA transcription – and disrupting the often fatal cytokine storm. As at least one person has noticed, the implications of this are enormous. If the medical establishment – including CDC – has been aware of the efficacy of chloroquine in treating coronavirus for at least 14 years, why has it not been mass produced and made available sooner? Given that CDC knows that Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19 and a prophylactic against infection. There are grounds for everyone that has suffered and the families of those who have died for a Class Action Law suit against the CDC — Ian Wilson (@Le_Nautonnier) March 19, 2020  Here, you might have imagined, is the dream solution: a stop gap treatment for coronavirus which could save many lives and obviate the need for this global lockdown which is destroying our economies. Why isn’t the solution being shouted from the rooftops? One possibility, as I suggested yesterday, is that there is no money in it for Big Pharma. Chloroquine is a generic drug. That’s why Big Pharma’s lobbyists have worked hard to persuade governments that there can be no acceptable solution till a patented vaccine is brought on to the market. Even if this happens it won’t be till long after the pandemic is over – probably not till at least next year. I don’t think our businesses, our livelihoods, our sanity can wait that long.

"On March 18, Governor Mike DeWine (R-OH), tweeted out a good and valid public-health suggestion—employers should monitor employees for fever:  We are asking businesses–beginning immediately—to take the temperature of every single employee every day before they come to work.  We’re asking them to be aggressive in regard to cleaning surfaces and having soap/hand sanitizer available.  Send employees home who are sick. DeWine’s suggestion is, of course, a variation on the age-old idea of a quarantine.  And yet his suggestion of bringing the logic of quarantine to the workplace is doubly powerful, because it offers the opportunity to bring legal, as well as medical, order to that large fraction of American life, the workplace.  Quarantine: A Time-Tested Idea Yet with any virus, notorious or not, the most basic of wisdom says that we maximize our health by staying apart from it. That is, we create walls, or barriers, of one kind another, by washing our hands, wearing face masks—and staying away from infected people.   This is basic biology.  The essential of physical separation and protection from harm are why cells have membranes, animals have fur or shells, and people have skin.    It’s also basic human nature.  The same ideas of separation and protection explain why people have been wise to build walls, and roofs, and to put things in containers.  And more recently, individuals and institutions have learned that they must protect their computers and networks from new kinds of viruses, as well as other cyber-pathogens.  Way back on January 31, President Trump issued a “Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus.”  As Trump put it,  Given the importance of protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the People’s Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.  Trump also added that, “where appropriate,” the U.S. would impose “quarantine.” Yes, quarantine. It’s not a PC word, merely a life-saving concept.  It comes from the Italian words quaranta giorni, meaning, “forty days.”  That is, the Venetians of yore had a rule: During times of plague, visitors had to spend nearly six weeks in isolation, to make sure that they weren’t carrying a killer into Venice.  And of course, there was no point in imposing a quarantine on some visitors and not others—and so the Venetians made sure that strangers didn’t come into their city without being properly vetted.   Indeed, a good overview on the overall effectiveness of quarantines was found in a 2013 article in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, headlined, “Lessons from the History of Quarantine, from Plague to Influenza A.”  In the new millennium, the centuries-old strategy of quarantine is becoming a powerful component of the public health response to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.  During the 2003 pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the use of quarantine, border controls, contact tracing, and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat in just over 3 months. For centuries, these practices have been the cornerstone of organized responses to infectious disease outbreaks. In other words, quarantines get the job done.  And yet, Tognotti added, new political pressures—those aforementioned forces of political correctness—are attacking the quarantine idea, because it’s so un-PC:   However, the use of quarantine and other measures for controlling epidemic diseases has always been controversial because such strategies raise political, ethical, and socioeconomic issues and require a careful balance between public interest and individual rights.  In a globalized world that is becoming ever more vulnerable to communicable diseases, a historical perspective can help clarify the use and implications of a still-valid public health strategy. In other words, Tognotti is saying, a quarantine might not be PC, but it’s still a good idea.  And so today, the U.S. needs to know about the people coming here, however they get here, be it by airplane, boat, car, or foot—and many countries around the world are reaching the same conclusion.  Yes to border controls and quarantine.   Moreover, we can quickly see that proper health security starts to look a lot like proper border security and proper homeland security—whether it’s a virus or a terrorist, Uncle Sam needs to know what, or who, is trying to invade.   These points were made well by an early prophet in this fast-moving pandemic, Lew Jan Olowski, staff counsel at the Immigration Reform Law Institute.  Way back on February 7, he wrote in The New York Daily News,  The first line of defense against coronavirus is the border.  Not just figuratively.  Any national border is, by definition, a literal line of defense . . . defending national borders is an essential element of any national security strategy. Olowski was 100 percent right, of course.  Interestingly, even now, even as President Trump has escalated his response, declaring a national state of emergency, we haven’t heard much from most Democrats on the subject of border security and quarantines.  Yes, we know that they don’t like Trump—although, of course, we knew that before—and yet it’s still hard to pick through exactly what they would do about infected people coming here and infecting Americans.    Indeed, Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, is still supportive of open borders and a no-questions-asked stance toward “migrants”–even as Trump, just on March 18, chose to slam the border shut even harder, this setting up a key contrast for the November election.  So where does that leave him on the issue of quarantines, even in times of national emergency? Inquiring minds should want to know.  In fact, we can now see that the forces of health security, border security, homeland security, and national security are all on the same side—or at least they should be—and so we should further ask: Why should we tolerate “sanctuary cities”?  The issue of sanctuary cities should be defined as the protection of the public health against disease, of course, and not the ethnicity of those involved.   That is, whoever you are, and wherever you’re from, the feds should want to know about your potential threat to health and good order, not your skin color or nationality.   Yes, the coronavirus is a death-blow to the anything-goes utopianism of open borders.  Many of us have always known that there’re lots of good reasons why borders should be policed, including, of course, concerns about protecting jobs and wages—and now we have yet another reason to think in terms of, yes, America First.   So now let’s take a look at an idea that builds on DeWine’s tweet.  Medical E-Verify  As politicos like to say, “Never let a crisis go to waste.”  In terms of making needed change and getting things done, that’s often good advice, because a sense of crisis provides the energy needed to topple the old orthodoxy.  In that spirit, here’s an idea for putting the crisis of the coronavirus crisis to good use: create a Medical E-Verify.  A Medical E-Verify, that is, for contagious diseases.   Most Breitbart News readers are familiar with E-Verify, an underused federal program, administered by the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, aimed at verifying the legality of employees and potential employees.  It’s a great program—when it’s used.   (And too often, employers don’t want to use E-Verify, but that’s a tale for another time.)  Yet now, in this crisis, we should seize the opportunity to create a Medical E-Verify, which would stipulate that all employers must verify the contagious health status of all employees.  Many employers already demand drug tests, so why not a contagious virus test?  To be sure, as of this writing, there aren’t enough tests to go around, but that will change soon enough.  And when we have enough tests, we should use them, on an ongoing and predictable basis.  Of course, opponents will raise privacy concerns, and those must be duly considered, and yet the prospect of a mass epidemic should push us toward a no-nonsense solution that looks out, first, for public health.     In addition, there will be concerns about the cost of the program, including the cost of treatment for the afflicted already inside our borders.  And here, of course, Uncle Sam should step in, because whatever the cost of treatment of an individual might be, the cost of a plague, to society, is vastly greater.   Of course, in addition, we should also be spending money on medical research, with an eye to not only treatment, but also a vaccine.   Some might claim that Medical E-Verify is “authoritarian.”  But actually, it’s not authoritarian at all: it’s about order.  And only the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union should think that order is the same thing as authoritarianism.  In fact, good order is what makes liberty possible, to say nothing of the pursuit of happiness. Because only if you’re not dying can you go about living.",Pinkerton: We Need ‘Medical E-Verify’ to Stop Pandemics Like Coronavirus,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/pinkerton-we-need-medical-e-verify-to-stop-pandemics-like-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"All 236 members of Georgia’s state legislature were urged Wednesday to self-isolate following possible exposure to the Chinese coronavirus from one of their colleagues. The lawmakers in both chambers were urged to make the move after one of their colleagues, State Sen. Brandon Beach (R), revealed he has tested positive for the virus. He was reportedly screened for the virus on Saturday after experiencing a fever and cough but did not get his results until Wednesday. Despite the lingering symptoms, he participated in a vote on Monday, possibly exposing his colleagues in the process. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the lawmaker “said he felt healthy enough to join dozens of legislators, staff members and reporters for a one-day special legislative session at the Capitol to grant Gov. Brian Kemp broad powers to respond to the pandemic.” His positive test prompted Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and House Speaker David Ralston (pictured) to instruct remaining members to self-isolate for the remainder of the month, or March 30. Gov. Kemp is using Beach’s case to demonstrate why people “need to do what we’re asking them to do” and stay home. “The biggest thing is social distance yourself,” he told 680 The Fan. “If you are sick, do not – do not – go out. Stay home until you can figure out what’s going on. Don’t go to the doctor. Don’t show up at the emergency room. Don’t show up at work.” Still, Beach’s decision prompted anger from some of his colleagues. “I’m shaking with rage,” State Rep. Scot Turner (R) said in a post. “We were told if we had symptoms to refrain from going to the Capitol on Monday.” He continued: Senator Brandon Beach knew he was exhibiting symptoms since MARCH THE 10TH! I have an elderly hospice patient at home. He irresponsibly stayed all day at the Capitol on Monday after being tested on Saturday and exposed all of us. … I cannot remember the last time I’ve been this angry.  Beach, however, said he began feeling better and “thought I was in the clear” after making the decision to vote on Monday. His wife also said he was “thought to be on the mend” before receiving his test results:  Two members of the U.S. Congress, Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL) and Rep. Ben McAdams (D-UT), have tested positive for the virus.",Coronavirus Threat: 236 Members of the Georgia State Legislature Urged to Self-Isolate,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/236-members-of-the-george-state-legislature-urged-to-self-isolate/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump promoted the use of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine at the White House on Thursday, the purpose of which is to treat people infected with the coronavirus. “We’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,” Trump said at the White House press briefing on Thursday.

The president also mentioned the anti-viral drug Remdesivir produced by Gilead as a possible treatment drug. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said that under the president’s direction he would move quickly for a chloroquine clinical trial to test its ability to treat the coronavirus. In the meantime, doctors can ask for experimental drugs to use to treat their patients as part of a “compassionate use” program. The president stated that anti-viral drugs had shown “very, very encouraging early results” in treatment tests. “I think it’s going to be very promising.

Promising “total victory” over the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump announced a series of additional measures Wednesday to help beat the pandemic — which include invoking a 70-year-old law that allows him to use the private sector to make up the shortage of medical supplies. At a White House briefing with his Coronavirus Task Force, Trump said the 1950 Defense Production Act — which allows the federal government to the marshal the manufacturing capabilities of the private sector during wartime — will be used “in case we need it.” “It can do a lot good things if we need it,” he said, adding that he would sign an order activating the law immediately. The United States has more than 9,415 coronavirus cases, according to a live tally tracked by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. death toll is 150 so far, with the majority recorded in Washington state. President Trump said using the Defense Production Act shows that his administration is taking a wartime footing in response to the disease, and said, “Now it’s our time.” “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together,” he added. “It’s the invisible enemy.

The president joked that even though reporters were spacing their seating in the briefing room they were not far enough apart. “You’re actually sitting too close, you should really, we should probably get rid of about another 75 – 80 percent of you,” he said. “I’ll have just two or three that I like in this room.” The president also accused the media of being hypocritical by criticizing him for taking a coronavirus test, despite not showing any symptoms. “I had to do it because the press was going crazy,” Trump said.",‘You Should Leave Immediately’ — Donald Trump Jokes Reporters Are Too Close,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/you-should-leave-immediately-donald-trump-jokes-reporters-are-too-close/,Breitbart
"Amid the rush for guns and ammo sales, a store owner in Arizona told Breitbart News the buying surge surpasses even the tremendous run witnessed during the post-Sandy Hook gun control push. Kyle Olsen, owner of Olsen Firearms, said, “We’ve never seen anything like this.” He specifically described the sales surge as eclipsing what his store witnessed in January 2013, a time when Joe Biden was pushing numerous post-Sandy Hook gun controls for Barack Obama. During the day, his sales team waited on customers while lines formed full of more customers waiting to be next. Gun after gun after gun was sold. Scottsdale, Arizona’s Scottsdale Gun Club told a similar story, and Riverfields, Amarillo, Texas, described a flurry of buyers as well. On March 18, 2020, Breitbart News reported Colorado gun sales jumped 100 percent last week alone.  KDVR reported 14,000 firearms were sold in the state last week, which is a 100 percent increase over the 7,000 that were sold in that same week one year ago. The Hill reports a national surge in gun sales as well. They suggest the surge began in the states that were most effected by the Chinese coronavirus–Washington, California, New York–then swept through the rest of the country from there. The irony of it all is that it’s my Democrat friends reaching out to me now asking me which guns they should buy just in case… in particular which ARs.  I guess they’re ok with the 2A now???

Breitbart News reported that Ammo.com witnessed a 276 percent increase in sales last week alone. The Hill quoted Ammo.com’s Alex Horsman saying, “We know certain things impact ammo sales, mostly political events or economic instability when people feel their rights may end up infringed, but this is our first experience with a virus leading to such a boost in sales.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"The United States surgeon general appealed to the younger generations on Thursday at the daily coronavirus press conference at the White House, asking them to donate blood to help fellow Americans and perhaps even “safe a life” by doing so. Dr. Jerome Adams praised the Food and Drug Administration’s announcement about expediting the pipeline that gets medication that might help people who are infected with the Chinese coronavirus, but then said Americans can help during this health emergency. “We know that many of you are home practicing the president’s guidelines for social distancing,” Adams said. “But one thing we should all consider — especially our millennials and Gen Z — is donating blood.” Adams, who is an anesthesiologist and still practices at Walter Reed National Medical Military Center in Bethesda, Maryland, stressed the need for the nation to have a fully stocked blood supply.

"Thursday, MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough slammed western media outlets, saying they are “showing a hell of a lot more skepticism towards western governments” at this time than they are “towards the Chinese authorities.” Scarborough called on outlets such as The New York Times to be more careful because they are “literally taking the word of the Chinese authorities” despite their lies and cover-ups. “Western media outlets have to be far more careful because I’m seeing a surge from The New York Times, I’m seeing other articles where they are literally taking the word of Chinese authorities despite what has happened over the past three months, despite the lying, despite the coverups, despite the destruction of records,” noted Scarborough. “And I would not bring this up normally because China and the United States have to work together now to get through this crisis. It did begin in China, but with western media outlets so rest recklessly moving forward, I don’t know exactly why they’re doing it, but they’re showing a hell of a lot more skepticism towards western governments right now, than they are towards the Chinese authorities that actually spread this through their coverups, through their lies.

"The State Department on Thursday advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel as the world grapples with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19,” the advisory, the highest of its kind, reads. “In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period. U.S. citizens who live abroad should avoid all international travel.” Travel Advisory: Level 4 – The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of #COVID19.

Until the upgrade, the department’s advice to U.S. citizens was to “reconsider” all international travel under what is known as a “level three” alert. The global “level four” warning was unprecedented as such alerts are generally reserved for specific countries embroiled in conflict, natural disasters or where Americans face specific risks. However, the upgrade will likely have little practical effect because it is not mandatory and there are now limited transportation options for international travel. The only way to ban Americans from going abroad would be to invalidate the use of U.S. passports for such travel, a bar that is currently in place only for North Korea.

"It seems like only yesterday that Joe Biden was talking about the guns he was going to ban and the gun makers he wanted leftists to be able to sue into oblivion. Then again, it could not have been yesterday, because yesterday gun stores were so overrun with in-person business that they could not answer their phones when people called to see what kind of guns were left on the shelves. And although Biden might have talked gun control days or weeks ago, whatever it was he said was drowned out by the 100 percent increase in gun purchases in Colorado last week alone. (Similar stories from around the country could be told.) Biden and other Democrats have spoken and made clear that they want gun control. This means banning commonly owned semiautomatic rifles such as AR-15s, AK-47s, Mini 14s, and others. It means banning suppressors, prohibiting ammunition magazines that hold more than ten rounds, putting storage requirements in place for gun owners, requiring registration of AR-15 owners, outlawing private gun sales, and suing gun manufacturers when a criminal steals then misuses a legally made, legally sold product. On February 24, 2020, Breitbart News reported Biden calling for a repeal of gun manufacturer lawsuit protections. He then called out gun makers and said, “I’m going to take you down.” And many other gun controls have been discussed by Biden and other Democrats. But the American people appear to be voting with their feet at this moment in time; with feet that are walking into gun store after gun store around the country to buy shotguns, pistols, and rifles for self-defense. At times like these, Americans of every walk of life realize their safety, and their family’s safety, is in their own hands.

"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is trying to accelerate the delivery of H-1B foreign workers to U.S. and Indian companies — despite the crashing economy and abundant evidence that many American graduates are facing discrimination and exclusion from software jobs. The acceleration was announced March 16 when DHS’s immigration services agency announced it would limit the use of “premium processing” to “help us to reduce overall H-1B processing times.” Under premium processing, companies can pay a premium to jump the line for roughly 100,000 H-1B work visas each year. But the line-jumping slows the routine award of H-1B visas to the corporate managers who prefer to hire blocs of compliant foreign workers instead of interviewing innovative American professionals and graduates. Each April, 85,000 H-1B visas are awarded to U.S. companies via a rushed application and lottery process by DHS’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency. Another “cap-exempt” 15,000 H-1Bs are awarded throughout the year to non-profit employers at universities, research laboratories, and hospitals. The cap-exempt employers are allowed to hire as many H-1Bs as they wish. The current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for the Indian-based outsourcing industry. The group’s mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to hire Indians graduates for jobs in the United States, and they split the economic gains among both countries’ companies, executives, and investors. Breitbart News asked DHS if the agency is considering curbs on the 2020 award of H-1B visas. “No changes at this time,” a spokesman responded March 19. Meanwhile, business groups are trying to expand the H-1B program. For example, activists are citing the coronavirus disease as an excuse for Congress to allow investors to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates for jobs in the healthcare sector. President Donald Trump’s failure to set curbs on the H-1B program has angered many of the swing-voting university graduates who supported him in 2016. In March 2016, after much zig-zagging, Trump declared: The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions. In February 2020, a U.S. judge struck down the token curbs set by USCIS managers since Trump’s election. Immigration reformers are calling for the cancellation of the 2020 H-1B awards amid the economic crash. “Why should Indians be favored over Americans who can’t pay their rent?” asked Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “It is ridiculous.” The USCIS agency said it will restart premium processing first for the benefit of tens of thousands of foreign graduates at U.S. universities. Many young foreigners want to convert their Optional Practical Training (OPT) work permits into multi-year H-1B visas so they can get the technology jobs that are sought by the Americans who sat alongside them in the university classroom. USCIS’s statement said: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services today announced the temporary suspension of premium processing service for fiscal year (FY) 2021 cap-subject H-1B petitions. … As USCIS has done in the past, premium processing will resume in a two-phased approach during the FY 2021 cap season so that USCIS can best manage premium processing requests. The first phase will include FY 2021 cap-subject H-1B petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, requesting a change of status from F-1 nonimmigrant status. The second phase will include all other FY 2021 cap-subject petitions. H-1B workers are allowed to stay for six years or longer when the employers nominate the foreign employees for green cards, regardless of the number of Americans who apply for the jobs. This multi-year process keeps roughly 750,000 H-1B employees in the United States, many of them in technology jobs that are sought by American graduates. The H-1B program provides the bulk of foreign visa workers in the United States. But additional visa programs help to keep roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa workers in jobs needed by U.S. graduates, mostly in software jobs along the two coasts. Most of the visa workers are from India, partly because many Indian-born managers in U.S. companies prefer to hire fellow Indian nationals instead of young American graduates, according to many American professionals. The discriminatory preference has sparked some private lawsuits amid years of inaction by federal agencies.

The resident foreign population also pushes mid-career Americans out of jobs, fuels discrimination lawsuits, and curbs innovation at the major U.S. companies who are now falling behind Chinese rivals. The inflow of H-1B workers also includes much corruption and little enforcement of U.S. workplace laws. On February 19, the Department of Justice announced the sentencing of an Indian-born executive for smuggling white-collar workers into the United States via the H-1B program. The Criminal Information alleges that [Sairam] YERUVA, and others, conspired to submit false and misleading information to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in support of at least one hundred eighty-three (183) initial H-1B petitions and at least one-hundred (100) H-1B extension petitions that were filed on behalf of KRONSYS, INC., CYGTEC, INC., and ARKSTEK, INC.  During the course of the conspiracy, YERUVA served as the corporate president of each of these three companies. According to the charging document, YERUVA, and others, declared in their initial petitions that their H-1B nonimmigrant foreign workers would be employed by the companies at specific work locations in or near Raleigh, North Carolina or Aurora, Colorado for the sole purpose of developing internal, or “in-house”, information technology projects.  The petitions also declared that the H-1B workers would be paid the prevailing wage throughout the entirety of their H-1B status with the companies. Yeruva’s wrist-slap sentence included just one year in jail and a fine of only $2.6 million. American professionals lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, doctorswithoutjobs.com, and ProUSworkers. These U.S. groups are also working with groups of would-be immigrants to the S.386 bill by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), which would dramatically increase the citizenship rewards to more Indian H-1B workers who take Americans’ college jobs. The groups include No on H.R. 1044 and The Multinational Coalition Against H.R. 1044/S. 386. In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher. Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries. The federal USCIS agency provides some data, including some data about the uncapped OPT program, sometimes called the “Mini-H-1B.” “The purpose of the H-1B program is to replace Americans with cheaper foreign workers,” said John Miano, a lawyer with the Immigration Reform Law Institute. He added: That’s it. No other description matches what Congress enacted, yet the media persists that with that bullshit notion that it is designed to provide higher-skilled workers. This notion is a typical lobbyist tactic — they take a turd and call it a rose, and most of the American media will call it a rose if the politicians — especially Democrats — say it is a rose. Govt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc. The Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.

The new tally is up from 1,971 cases announced earlier today. De Blasio’s press briefing comes after he attempted to clarify his position on a possible shelter-in-place order, which was swiftly shot down by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in an effort to tamper down possible public panic. “For anyone who wants to get educated: It’s quite a clear model,” said the mayor. “I want to be explicit. I’m talking about the San Francisco model. It is not the same thing as closing the bridges, closing the borders.” De Blasio also dismissed claims that a cluster of coronavirus cases have been detected in Borough Park, Brooklyn. “There is no cluster in New York City at this moment,” he stated. “In terms of something that would equate to a cluster … the prime example we would have is New Rochelle. The health commissioner says we have none in New York City.” New York City is expected to receive $1.38 billion in federal funding, but De Blasio warns the figure falls short.

"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Gov. Tom Wolf issued a sweeping shutdown order to tens of thousands of “non-life-sustaining” businesses Thursday, decreeing they must close their physical locations by 8 p.m. to slow the spread of the coronavirus or face enforcement by state police and other government agencies. Citing his authority under the state’s disaster declaration law, Wolf, a Democrat, ordered more than 150 types of businesses to close their physical locations, warning that enforcement against violators would begin Saturday. It was among the toughest measures yet taken by a U.S. governor in response to the virus pandemic. It also drew fierce condemnation from majority Republicans in the Legislature. “I had hoped for voluntary compliance so our public safety officials could focus on assisting with the crisis,” Wolf said in a video statement. “Unfortunately we have not seen full compliance. We have no time to lose.” Wolf said his order would be enforced by state troopers, local officials, the state Health and Agriculture departments and the Liquor Control Board. The two-term governor had previously said he would not use police for enforcement. Businesses that fail to comply risk citations, fines or license suspensions, and “forfeit their ability to receive any applicable disaster relief and/or may be subject to other appropriate administrative action,” Wolf’s office said in a statement. Criminal prosecution is also a possibility, with violators subject to fines or imprisonment, Wolf’s office said. Law enforcement will use discretion as they enforce the governor’s order, Wolf spokeswoman Lyndsay Kensinger said in a separate email, citing a “range of potential actions,” including notifying people about the closure order, warnings, citations and what she termed “mandatory closure.” Republican lawmakers warned of economic devastation and accused Wolf of setting off panic. Senate GOP leaders late Thursday pushed Wolf for more transparency and the opportunity for business owners to appeal, while their House counterparts suggested they might challenge Wolf in the courts. Among those allowed to stay open are gas stations, grocery stores, beer distributors, drugstores and building materials stores. Restaurants and bars can continue to offer carry-out, delivery and drive-thru food and drink service, but not dine-in service. Businesses under shutdown orders range from coal mines to building contractors to many types of manufacturers, plus professional offices including law firms and accounting offices. Retailers ordered to close include car dealers, clothing stores, furniture stores, florists, office supply stores and lawn and garden stores. Wolf’s directive also prohibits elective health procedures as officials work to help hospitals create more capacity in anticipation of a surge in coronavirus patients. Gene Barr, president and chief executive of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, predicted Wolf’s order — unprecedented in its scope — would cause alarm in the business community, but he acknowledged “this is a place where there’s no easy answers.” “He is faced with a tough decision, doing something that we all know is going to have significant economic damage, balanced against the need to save lives,” Barr said. The chamber will review the state’s list of businesses deemed nonessential and potentially work to get some reopened, Barr said, but will not challenge Wolf’s overall authority to mandate the closures. “We’re going to do it. The governor said this is what you’re going to do, we’re going to do it, we’re going to comply,” Barr said. The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business advocacy group with 13,000 members in Pennsylvania, demanded to know the medical basis of the shutdown order, predicting it would cause personal and financial devastation. The group also said Wolf should have given companies more lead time to secure equipment and notify workers. “We understand that there are necessary precautions that must be taken to protect life, but no other governor, even in states with many more cases and wider community spread, has taken this extreme action,” said Gordon Denlinger, NFIB state director in Pennsylvania. John Longstreet, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, said the order was initially very ambiguous, causing panic over whether hotels would have to shutdown and put guests out within hours. But the industry received assurances from the Wolf administration that lodging facilities are exempt. “It would have meant thousands of guests put out on the street, without anywhere go to,” Longstreet said. “We’ve got this resolved now.” Wolf’s order came as Pennsylvania reported another big jump in confirmed coronavirus cases. Confirmed coronavirus cases topped 180, up 40%, according to the state Department of Health. In Philadelphia, officials reported that 20 of the 44 cases there are health care workers, although they were not all exposed at work. Meanwhile, with schools ordered shut for at least the rest of March and possibly longer, the state Education Department canceled statewide tests for schoolchildren because of the coronavirus pandemic. Health Secretary Rachel Levine said her agency is asking hospitals, starting Friday, to update their emergency plans to accommodate patents who contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The department is lifting a regulation that prevents a hospital from adding beds without permission, and is trying to make sure that hospitals have adequate supplies of personal protective equipment and ventilators. A look at the other developments in Pennsylvania: ___ CASES Confirmed cases in Pennsylvania rose by 52, the Pennsylvania Department of Health announced Thursday. About two-thirds of confirmed cases have been in southeastern Pennsylvania. The majority of testing is now being done by private labs or hospitals, which are increasingly operating drive-through sites where someone who is showing symptoms can get a sample taken for testing. Philadelphia officials said they hope to open a testing site by the stadium complex, possibly by Friday afternoon. The priorities will be testing health care workers with COVID-19 symptoms and people who are age 50 or over with COVID-19 symptoms. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. Pennsylvania reported its first death Wednesday from the coronavirus. ___ STANDARDIZED TESTS HALTED The state Education Department on Thursday canceled statewide tests for schoolchildren in Pennsylvania because of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials said there would be no Pennsylvania System of School Assessment tests, called the PSSAs, or Keystone Exams. The PSSAs were scheduled to begin April 20, the Keystone Exams May 11. About 128,000 students take the Keystone Exams and about 770,000 the PSSA every year. The state also ended this year’s Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment, for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The Keystone Exams, a high school graduation requirement, measure end-of-course proficiency in algebra, English and biology. The PSSAs, often used to compare the quality of school district instruction, are given to students in grades 3 through 8 for English and math, and for grades 4 through 8 in science. ___ UNEMPLOYMENT FILINGS Unemployment compensation filings eased off a bit in Pennsylvania. Wednesday’s claims hit 54,000, a day after reaching 70,000, according to the state Department of Labor and Industry, as businesses close and lay off or furlough workers. Wolf on Monday ordered a shutdown of nonessential businesses, although some business owners are confused as to whether it includes them while others have defied it. The state saw barely 12,000 filings in the entire first week of March, according to federal data. ___ TURNPIKE SERVICE PLAZAS REOPEN The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission is reversing itself and will reopen all 17 of its service plazas starting Friday. The decision to close them drew heavy criticism from truckers. Restrooms inside all service plazas will be open 24 hours, and outdoor portable toilets — brought in as replacements — will remain in place at the service plazas for about a week. Limited food options also will be available at all service plazas, for take-out only. Gas stations and convenience stores inside the service plazas will continue to remain open 24 hours a day. ___ BEER AND LIQUOR The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board began boarding up around two dozen of its now-closed wine and liquor stores that had a history of prior break-ins. It also has advised beer distributors that they are free to remain open. Wolf’s administration, meanwhile, has promised a crackdown on bars and restaurants that fail to adhere to Wolf’s order to stop serving food and drink on-site, reiterating they are free to sell wine and beer to-go. Separately, liquor industry trade groups had urged Wolf to reopen state-run liquor stores that have shutdown due to the virus, or consider alternatives to closure.",Pennsylvania Governor Orders Non-Life-Sustaining Businesses to Shut Down,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/pennsylvania-governor-orders-non-life-sustaining-businesses-to-shut-down/,Breitbart
"A proposed expansion of the EB-5 green-card program should not be included in the coronavirus recovery bill, Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News Thursday evening. “Absolutely not,” said Graham (R-S.C), after multiple reports said he was trying to insert a huge EB-5 expansion in the pending legislation. He continued: I haven’t talked to anybody on the planet, much less the Trump administration, about putting EB-5  on the coronavirus bill … That is not the time or the place. The President supports the [EB-5] program. I do too. We’re not going put a damn thing on this [coronavirus] bill that doesn’t protect you and your family from the virus and doesn’t give you money. In a morning appearance on Fox News, Graham said the coronavirus money should be directed at working Americans, not just companies: We’re at war with the virus and here’s the good news, you can kill this virus if you just stay away from each other. … What do you when you’ve got constituents out of work? What do you do with people who lost their job in Myrtle Beach?  You give them a paycheck. What do you do to a small business that has no customers? You give them a loan so they can get through this, and you can forgive the loan later. All of us should be about income stability. [If] you just lost your job — I’m gonna do everything I can to make sure in the next 48 hours, or 72, hours, we find a way to replace your income. Graham is up for reelection in November. The EB-5 program awards green cards and the promise of citizenship to foreign investors who lend money to private U.S. companies. The program is widely used in the real estate sector by investors to raise construction funds. The program is often described as a citizenship-for-loans scheme, in which American citizens are forced to share their citizenship with the wealthy foreign families who lend their money to wealthy American investors. The EB-5 program has been a boon to the real estate investors who use it to raise funds for new construction in prosperous coastal cities from wealthy Chinese and Indians who want green cards. But the program is so scandal-prone that President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security imposed a major rewrite in 2019. The rewrite forces lenders to lend twice as much money and pressures them to lend their money to poorer communities outside the major coastal centers. Coronavirus: Chinese Elite May Win More U.S. Citizenship-for-Investment Visas Despite Scandalshttps://t.co/rAkckRQ6M5 — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 20, 2020  In his show Thursday evening, Hannity defended the EB-5 program and suggested that Politico produced a false EB-5 report, saying, “So Politico magazine’s report is an outright falsehood?” Graham initially defended Politico and suggested the problem was caused by another media outlet, but he reversed himself and tagged Politico: I don’t think it is Politico. I think it is another  [outlet]. Yes [it was Politico], absolute garbage. I haven’t talked to anybody. I would object to putting anything on these bills that is not related to solving the problem. What’s the problem? People have lost their jobs … and we’re also speeding up bombing, starving, and killing the virus. On Wednesday, Politico reported: The Trump administration is considering a controversial proposal to boost the number of visas offered to wealthy immigrants who invest money in the United States as it tries to boost a faltering economy amid the escalating coronavirus outbreak, according to four people familiar with the situation. … The expansion is being pushed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a Trump ally who has supported easing restrictions in the past, according to one of the people. His office did not respond to a request for comment. Breitbart News reported the proposal on Thursday. The Graham interview came after Tucker Carlson highlighted the EB-5 controversy on his Fox News show. Lindsey Graham responds on Hannity without naming Tucker Carlson although it seems like he comes close pic.twitter.com/Z2GEyQ2LZ2 — Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) March 20, 2020  Hannity defended the EB-5 program, saying it helps investors and creates U.S. jobs. The proposed expansion, he said: …would allow wealthy Chinese, if they lend money or, or purchase, or invest money in the U.S. — which by the way, that’s a common practice [in] New Zealand, Australia. It is a way of creating jobs and investment dollars in the U.S. I actually support it, except we have to be very careful with countries that are hostile, like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Sen. Lindsey Graham seems to be using the China epidemic to accelerate the private sale of EB-5 citizenship deals to wealthy Chinese who lend money to US biz elites.

"On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” former National Security Adviser Susan Rice stated that China does deserve some blame for how it handled the coronavirus outbreak, and “China is not behaving well in trying to blame this on the United States. But the flip side of it is, we are not behaving well when we talk about, as the president does every day, the Chinese virus, the Wuhan flu, and all of these racist descriptions.” Rice said, “So, there’s a lot of blame to be placed on China in terms of how it handled its processes internally, how they treated their people, how they suppressed information. And certainly, China is not behaving well in trying to blame this on the United States. But the flip side of it is, we are not behaving well when we talk about, as the president does every day, the Chinese virus, the Wuhan flu, and all of these racist descriptions. The fact of the matter is, that viruses don’t know borders. They don’t respect borders. In 2009, the swine flu pandemic that swept the world, that was extremely deadly, in terms of lives ultimately lost, originated in North America. So, we need to get out of the business of blaming people for where viruses arise, which can arise anywhere on the planet, and get into the business of working together to defeat them. And my concern is, with all of the very bad blood now on this topic, among others, between the United States and China, we are not only deflecting from the imperative of getting our own act together here in the United States…but we are race-baiting, and we are making it much more difficult to rally other countries, not just China, but many other countries, to cooperate in this endeavor.” (h/t Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","Susan Rice: China ‘Not Behaving Well’ in Blaming U.S. for Coronavirus, U.S. Isn’t ‘Behaving Well’ When Trump Uses ‘Racist Descriptions’",2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/19/susan-rice-china-not-behaving-well-in-blaming-u-s-for-coronavirus-u-s-isnt-behaving-well-when-trump-uses-racist-descriptions/,Breitbart
"CLAIM: The coronavirus outbreak hit the U.S. because President Donald Trump “eliminated” President Barack Obama’s pandemic office. VERDICT: FALSE. Former vice president Joe Biden claimed on Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. is “paying the price” of coronavirus because President Trump “eliminated” an office that dealt with pandemics. The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19. Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price. — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) March 19, 2020  Biden is wrong — very wrong. This falsehood almost deserves an entirely separate category of ignominy because of its ability to divide and frighten people in the middle of a crisis that requires social cooperation and trust. The truth — as explained earlier this week in the Washington Post by former National Security Council official Tim Morrison — is that the office was combined with others in a reorganiztion that “left the biodefense staff unaffected.” Breitbart News had already fact-checked similar inaccurate claims by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg when he made them in the Democrat Debate in South Carolina on Feb. 26. We did it again last week. Biden has a particularly poor record on handling pandemics. In 2009, he caused panic during a swine flu outbreak by telling Americans not to take flights or ride subways. Today he barely remembers what disease we are fighting. Not once has Biden offered President Trump his support in the fight against the coronavirus. Instead, he and his campaign are trying to score political points as Americans suffer. That is worse than “false.” It is disqualifying. Joel B.

"The Castro Valley, California, Solar Tactical gun store is refusing to be labeled non-essential and is keeping its doors open even though “shelter in place” orders have been given.

"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) reacted to California Governor Gavin Newsom’s (D) “stay at home” order by stating he would think the governor would consult with other officials before making such a decision, and “We do think there was an ability to do this without shutting down the entire state. I hope he consulted with a lot of experts before he just made this decision.” McCarthy said, “Well, you know how serious this virus is and how contagious it is.

"Thursday, Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson called on Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) to resign after reports show he sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock after signaling a warning to a group called the Tar Heel Club about the threat of the coronavirus. The allegation is that Burr gave contradicting information publicly, downplaying the threat before his sell-off and may have had inside information given his position as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “You may have seen news reports this afternoon that chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee sold more than a million dollars in stock in mid-February after learning about how devastating the Chinese coronavirus could be. He had inside information about what could happen to our country, which is now happening,” Carlson said. “But he didn’t warn the public. He didn’t give a primetime address. He didn’t go on television to sound the alarm. He didn’t even disavow an op-ed he’d written just 10 days before claiming America was “better prepared than ever for coronavirus.” “He didn’t do any of those things,” he continued. “Instead, what did he do? He dumped his shares in hotel stocks so he wouldn’t lose money, and then he stayed silent. Maybe there is an honest explanation for what he did. If there is, he should share it with the rest of us immediately. Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate and face prosecution for insider trading.

"The FBI is warning that state-level shutdowns due to the coronavirus may delay the background checks required to purchase a new or used handgun at retail. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) gives one of three responses when a background check for a gun purchase is performed. It either gives an approval; a fail, which means no sale; or a delay, which means the instant review can be extended up to three business days for further records checks on the would-be buyer. The FBI posted a message to their NICS page intimating that state-level shutdowns over coronavirus could impact the three-day time frame for extended checks. This time-frame, referred to as the Brady Transfer Date, is the subject of the FBI message: Should a state choose to limit their days of operation or close state offices, this could potentially impact the Brady Transfer Date (BTD) by changing the time in which an FFL can legally transfer a firearm in a delayed status. The NICS Section urges FFLs to be cognizant of the impact this may have to your day-to-day operations, and also to stress the importance of adhering to the BTD that is provided to you at the time a transaction is put into a Delay status. The Brady Act does not federally prohibit an FFL from transferring a firearm after the third business day expires, even if the NICS Section has been unable to provide a proceed response, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922(t)(1). Gun sales are currently surging across the country, and the FBI is warning that shutdowns could impact transfer times.

"The Trump administration is seeking out various American manufacturers to help make essential supplies needed to fight the coronavirus without relying on foreign imports and supply chains from China. Spokespeople for General Motors (GM) and Ford have said they are open to working with the Trump administration to retool their American factories to produce supplies like ventilators and other medical necessities. “We are already studying how we can potentially support production of medical equipment like ventilators,” a GM spokesperson told the media. Tesla’s Elon Musk said he too is open to supplying the Trump administration with supplies if necessary. We will make ventilators if there is a shortage — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 19, 2020  On Fox News, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said he is in talks with multiple companies who manufacture and produce their products in the U.S. He said: I got a call from a company Pernod Ricard … it makes alcoholic beverages. They had volunteered to make hand sanitizer using their alcohol. They had some obstacles, so I made three phone calls, one to the Treasury [Department], one to the [Federal Drug Administration], one to [Health and Human Services] to clear their obstacles out of the way in Trump time … and today we got a commitment that they’re going to start producing on Friday, and over time, we’re going to have 4,000 gallons a week [of hand sanitizer] and they’re going to be able to send it to the government at no cost. “And by the way, these facilities are going to be in America, they’re in West Virginia, Arkansas, Texas, and Kentucky,” Navarro said.  Navarro also said Honeywell, a multinational corporation stationed in Charlotte, North Carolina, was in touch with the White House on plans to open a plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to manufacture and produce face masks for Americans. “Already we have Honeywell moving towards that,” Navarro said of the deal. “So what it looks like is, having the appropriate incentives for our domestic industry to produce these things like face masks and hand sanitizer and all the things we need.” He went on to say: What we need longterm … the government does not buy American enough. The government, the VA, HHS, DOD [are] tremendously large consumers of medicines, medical supplies, and medical equipment. And so I’m working with the president as we speak to get an executive order to the finish line that would provide long term incentives for our companies to produce here. Breitbart News columnist Jim Pinkerton on Thursday likened Trump’s “Whole of America” approach to fighting the coronavirus to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s war-time nationalist policies that helped win the Allied Nations the Second World War: So we’re getting the picture; as this author has noted in the past here at Breitbart News, U.S. mobilization during World War Two was a wonder to behold.  The wondrously huge surge in production—as FDR said, “working on a seven-day week basis . . . building more new plants”—gave us a relatively quick victory on the battlefront. [Emphasis added] Also, interestingly, this wartime surge gave us generously overtimed prosperity on the homefront.  In fact, a great many Breitbart News readers look back with pride as they recall what their grandfathers, grandmothers, and others accomplished, working line jobs at defense plants such as Michigan’s legendary Willow Run.  Indeed, these many decades later, the testimony of Breitbart News readers is inspiring. [Emphasis added] … In fact, just on March 18, the Detroit News reported that General Motors and Ford are exploring ways that they can shift their auto-manufacturing capacity toward the manufacturing of breathing ventilators for severely afflicted corona patients. [Emphasis added] We can pause to note that this is exactly the sort of home-grown can-do that we need at a time such as this.  That is, we need good patriotic spirit from the business community, and we need the machinery, and the machinists, to be close at hand, within our borders, so that those industrial and human assets can be immediately repurposed for the saving of lives. [Emphasis added] The results of U.S. free trade with China have meant that the U.S. currently depends on China to produce an estimated 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that are needed to manufacture drugs in the U.S. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was enacted and China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), nearly five million American manufacturing jobs have been eliminated from the American economy — 3.4 million of which are due to U.S. free trade with China. The mass elimination of working- and middle-class jobs and depressed U.S. wages due to NAFTA and China’s entering the WTO have coincided with a 600 percent increase in trade deficits.

"Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) unloaded upwards of $1.56 million in stock after receiving confidential briefings regarding the outbreak of the Coronavirus. Burr, who is the senior senator from North Carolina and plans to retire in 2022, dumped thousand of dollars worth of stock on Feb. 13—less than a week before the stock market sharply dropped because of the coronavirus pandemic. The senator’s timely decision to sell, which was first reported by ProPublica, netted him between over $580,000 and $1.56 million. Much of those shares are now worth a fraction of their price when Burr opted to sell. For instance, the prior investment Burr had in Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, which was worth upwards of $150,000, is now valued at two-thirds that price. Similarly, the nearly $100,000 worth of stock in Extended Stay America that Burr disposed of in February is now estimated to be worth over 50 percent less. Those transactions, 29 in total, that Burr conducted came as the intelligence committee was receiving daily briefings on the spread of the coronavirus. During February, in particular, Burr and his colleagues on Capitol Hill were closely monitoring the situation unfolding. It remains unclear if the senator was briefed on the growing pandemic directly or preceding his decision to sell. On the day in question, though, deaths resulting from the Coronavirus grew to more than 1,400, and the Centers for Disease Control warned the ailment could be spread from those not exhibiting symptoms—developments unlikely to have escaped the intelligence committee’s notice. More troubling is that the senator’s private actions differed from his public statements on the coming pandemic. Less than a week before Burr shed investments likely to lose value because of the virus, the senator penned an op-ed urging voters to have trust in the federal government’s preparedness. “No matter the outbreak or threat, Congress and the federal government have been vigilant in identifying gaps in its readiness efforts and improving its response capabilities,” Burr wrote with his colleague, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN). The revelations come as the senator faces criticism for other private actions he took in the weeks leading up to the pandemic reaching crisis level. Most notably, Burr came under fire Tuesday after it emerged he’d warned North Carolina business leaders not to take the virus lightly during a closed door meeting in Washington, D.C. “There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,” the senator said on Feb. 27, according to a recording obtained by NPR. “It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.”",Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dumped $1.5M in Stock After Coronavirus Briefings,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/senate-intelligence-committee-chair-dumped-1-5m-in-stock-after-coronavirus-briefings/,Breitbart

You’re talking about a state of 8.6 million people, thousands new cases in a day. We’ve got to be honest about the sheer extent of this problem and where is the federal government? Where is the military? Why won’t the president give the order to mobilize our military to guarantee that these products are being produced through the defense production act and get them to the American front in this war which is New York.” He added, “We have been pleading for weeks with the federal government to step in. We’re now by far the epicenter of this crisis here in New York state. What does it take to get some attention? What does it take for our president? He’s from New York and he’s betraying the city he comes from. All he has to do is order the military to active duty to fight this war, to fight this challenge, this enemy, and he’s not doing it, even though he activated the Defense Production Act not a single factory that I know of has been mandated to go on 24/7 production of ventilators and surgical masks.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Mayor Bill de Blasio: Donald Trump Is ‘Betraying’ New York,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/19/mayor-bill-de-blasio-donald-trump-is-betraying-new-york/,Breitbart

We have to speak together as Americans, and we the people should come first before any reference to Republican or Democrat, and I say this to any politician that’s in any of this, ‘You even say the word Democrat or Republican pejoratively, you’re doing it wrong.’ Cuban went on, “Everything should start with we the people, and we have to do this as a country and put politics behind us and hopefully we’ll benefit from that.  Governmental financial relief for businesses harmed by the coronavirus outbreak should treat all levels of employees equally, Cuban advised. A “working level employee” should receive equal treatment “in terms of equity on grants, options, or warrants” as CEOs and executives, he said. President Donald Trump and the White House are responding competently to the coronavirus pandemic, assessed Cuban. “I think they’re doing everything — for the most part — right,” determined Cuban of the Trump administration. “We’ve never been through this before. Nobody can speak from experience. Nobody knows what’s going to happen next, and so the best we can do is come together as a country.” Cuban concluded, “Whether or not you like the president, whether or not you support him for reelection is irrelevant. Nobody knows exactly what to do. There’s going to be mistakes and we have to come together as a country and stand behind our government and say, ‘You know what, let’s do this together. It’s we the people. We’re not Republicans or Democrats anymore. Let’s do all we can to get this right.'” Pollak’s full interview with Cuban will be aired on the next installment of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) confirmed a 90-day waiver for all mortgage payments on Thursday due to the “tremendous economic pressure” of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo has ordered banks to temporarily suspend all mortgage payments over the next 90 days. All fees for overdraft, ATMs, and credit card uses will also be waived during this time. Furthermore, banks will be required to extend support by way of grace periods for loan modifications, and the suspension of foreclosures. “We know people are experiencing tremendous economic pressure due to #COVID19,” Cuomo tweeted on Thursday afternoon. “To help, NYS will direct mortgage payments be WAIVED for 90 days based on financial hardship (w/ no late fees & no negative impact on credit). We will help New Yorkers suffering financially.” We know people are experiencing tremendous economic pressure due to #COVID19.

The governor, however, believes that there could be “tens of thousands” more. On Wednesday in CNN’s Situation Room, Cuomo told Wolf Blitzer that increases in testing are “revealing more cases” and that he expects the contagion is “much more widespread than any of these numbers suggest.” There is, however, one notable gap in the midst of this good news: the millions of New Yorkers who rent their homes, rather than owning them outright. “What about RENT?!?” WokeAF Daily host Danielle Moodie-Mills asked in response to the announcement. “65% of NYers do not own homes.

"A supposed plan by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) would reward more of China’s elite to essentially buy American citizenship for themselves and their families with the promise of investing in U.S. cities. Under the EB-5 visa, wealthy foreign nationals can claim that they will invest at least $500,000 and thus receive Green Cards for their family for at least two years, with pathways to American citizenship available as well. The only requirement is that the EB-5 investor creates ten U.S. jobs and help revitalize “distressed” areas, though more often than not investors fund projects in wealthy zip codes. Currently, 10,000 foreign nationals and their families are allowed to enter the U.S. every year on the EB-5 visa. The overwhelming majority of EB-5 visas are rewarded to China’s elite — driving a migration of rich Chinese to cities across the country. The plan is afoot even as President Trump’s administration is considering action against China for allowing the coronavirus to spread across the globe. “Increasing Chinese immigration to the United States seems like an odd thing to put in a #COVID19 recovery bill,” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said in response to reports of increasing EB-5 visa admissions. “Right?!” The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) has mapped out the ever-growing list of scandals and corruption in the EB-5 visa program where wealthy foreign investors have been known to never follow through on their promise to invest. (Center for Immigration Studies) In a 2015 scandal, the Justice Department brought charges against EB-5 recipient Sang Ah Park — the daughter-in-law of former Southern Korean President Chun Doo-hwan — after a corruption-traced investment was made into a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania project. A 2017 case alleged that EB-5 recipients Edward and Jen Chen “diverted many millions of dollars away from EB-5 investments for their own personal use” in Los Angeles, California. In a famous case, as CityLab noted, New York City’s Hudson Yards was funded by EB-5 investors who raised more than a billion to develop the giant construction project on expensive Manhattan’s West Side: Hudson Yards, of course, is nobody’s idea of distressed. Located at the source of New York’s High Line, it’s the most expensive real-estate project in U.S. history. It could not possibly qualify as distressed under the terms of the program, or any understanding of the word. In order to buy EB-5 visas at the lower rate ($500,000), immigrant investors must put their money behind projects in areas with high unemployment—a proxy for need. [Emphasis added] Manhattan’s West Side may not suffer for lack of opportunity, but, as Kimmelman notes, New York real estate is a realm for Kurosawa-esque visionaries. The Related Companies, the developer behind Hudson Yards, raked in at least $1.2 billion in EB-5 funds for this project. To qualify, Related needed a work-around to bypass the distressed-area requirements—a pass that New York authorities were happy to issue. [Emphasis added] In 2018, the U.S. rewarded nearly 8,000 wealthy foreign investors and their family members with green cards. Between 2014 and 2018, the federal government gave EB-5 visas to about 43,130 wealthy foreign investors and their family members who can secure American citizenship after five years of living in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, marking a major political comeback in what started as a very dismal and lackluster campaign. Biden has not only won the majority of delegates but he has secured the majority of endorsements from former democratic challengers.  The most important statement from his Super Tuesday speech came when Biden called for unity with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in order to defeat Donald Trump. Americans taking stock of the Democratic race are not unfamiliar with apparent differences between Biden and Sanders. The primary race is not over, but Democrats are coalescing around Biden as their most electable candidate and with the common goal of landing a Democrat in the White House.   Biden and Sanders have far more in common on abortion, religious liberty, gun rights, health care, immigration, economic policy, and education than what the media has portrayed. Biden, the so-called “moderate,” and Sanders, the “democratic socialist,” are really two sides of the same Democratic coin. So far, the media continues to provide cover for Biden’s candidacy by painting him as a “centrist” Democrat and by ignoring his many campaign gaffes.  The fact is that many of Biden’s positions are just as damaging and harmful to the Constitution and American freedom as Sanders’s would be.  Simply put, a Biden presidency would be a major setback and defeat for Americans who want to protect the unborn, defend religious liberty, maintain a robust economy, recognize the right to bear arms, and promote American peace through strength at home and abroad. Biden would reverse the Hyde amendment, which has been law since 1976, which prohibits taxpayer-funded abortion advancing a big government agenda of abortion-on-demand with devastating consequences on children in the womb.   In addition, the former five president declared that he would put former Texas congressman and presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, a staunch advocate of gun control, in charge of gun policy. Biden later argued with a factory worker in Detroit, Michigan, who was defending the Second Amendment. The video of their exchange went viral.  Biden has promised to sign the deceptively-named Equality Act, which would enable big government to interfere with private businesses, non-profits, private colleges, and churches that continue to affirm and uphold traditional views on marriage and sexuality. This sweeping change would have a massive impact on people of faith everywhere. Biden has also embraced numerous elements of the “Green New Deal,” which would be a major setback for U.S. production and manufacturing, and cost American taxpayers trillions of dollars while causing major job losses.   While some in the media argue that a Biden administration would be a return to “normal,” it would pose a substantial threat to the values of the majority of Americans. If the Democrats were to control a Senate majority, with only 50 or 51 seats, they could approve judges at will. They may also end the filibuster for ordinary legislation, ensuring that destructive regulation would prevail without any bipartisan consensus. Democrats like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-Ny), and Biden, who represent the old-guard establishment wing of the Democratic Party want the same big-government policies that Sanders does, just without the  “socialist” label.  It is apparent to anyone watching this race closely that they do not represent the values and interests of most Americans. Whether Biden or Sanders, conservatives need to be wary that unfettered, permanent big government control over life and liberty would be certain.   Ryan Helfenbein is the Vice President of Communications and Public Engagement at Liberty University and Executive Director of the Falkirk Center for Faith & Liberty.

"The hospital and health care facilities first responders are warning that $100 billion is needed for workers to stay safe and patients to get adequate care as people infected with the coronavirus seek medical treatment. “We’re getting to a real dire position here with some hospitals having only a few days’ worth of masks on hand,” Washington State Hospital Association spokeswoman Beth Zborowski said in an NBC News story. Zborowski said even after getting two supply shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile, some hospitals in Washington state are already running low on supplies, which will put health care workers at risk. The coronavirus legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump includes funding to help hospitals by increasing the number of beds and medical supplies but does not provide a direct pipeline for needed goods, including ventilators and personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines. NBC News reported on the National Hospital Association and the American Medical Association’s letter to Congress: After a second spending bill without direct payments was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the American Hospital Association cautioned congressional leaders in a statement that “more needs to be urgently done.” That package expands sick leave and makes testing for the coronavirus more widely available. On Thursday, the association dramatically expanded its earlier request from $1 billion to $100 billion for direct funding for hospitals, the group told NBC News. In a joint letter to congressional leaders, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association write: “Based on the initial costs in the states with growing COVID-19 community spread, Congress should allocate $100 billion to front line health care personnel and providers, including physicians, nurses, hospitals and health systems, and direct the federal agencies to begin to infuse funds immediately so that they can afford to take the necessary steps to fight the battle against this unseen enemy.” The association said that the traditional distribution of money through various agencies and state entities takes far too long.
At the daily press conference of the coronavirus task force and President Donald Trump, the president was asked about the National Hospital Association’s concern of not getting enough funding in current legislation. “That is a separate issue, but we are looking at it directly,” Trump said. “We are looking at it directly.” “We are working with Democrats and Republicans on that,” Trump said. “We are looking at that specifically.” Breitbart News made multiple requests to the National Hospital Association about the needs of health care first responders and whether those needs were being met. The association did not respond to those inquiries.

"The Job Creators Network (JCN), one of the country’s largest pro-jobs grassroots organizations, sent a letter on Thursday, along with 28 business advocacy groups, endorsing Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)’s Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act to support businesses impacted by the coronavirus. The Republican senators are working to circulate the letter to every senator, FCN said, with the letter focusing on highlighting “two key aspects” of the lawmakers’ bill. “First, an emergency loan program to support small businesses during this crisis, with loans made available through private banks, supported with a federal guarantee. Using the private banking system to provide these loans is critical, as small business needs the liquidity immediately,” the letter reads. “Second, including in the emergency loan program a clause that forgives a portion of the loan equal to an appropriate percentage of payroll (with an appropriate salary cap) for any business that keeps their employees on salary despite having to shut down,” the letter continues. Small businesses’ backs are up against the wall and the Rubio-Collins bill is a save small business operation that should receive unanimous support in the Congress,” said Alfredo Ortiz, JCN President and CEO. “The Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act will help keep America’s small business community up and running and set the stage for a Main Street Recovery when this is over.” The letter from Job Creators Network comes as Senate Republicans are moving to finalize legislation for “Stage 3” of the economic stimulus package, including provisions that would provide U.S. households with direct payments from the federal government.  Earlier this week, JCN launched a 30-second ad asking small businesses what they need the Trump administration and Congress to do to help them wade through the coronavirus.

"The majority of Americans approve of President Trump’s job performance overall, and even more have a positive view of his administration’s response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic — a phenomenon that appears to be growing day by day — according to a Harris poll released Thursday. Pollsters conducted the survey on 2,050 U.S. adults in two waves — one last week, March 14-15, 2020, and the second March 17-18, 2020. The separate polls demonstrate that Americans across the board are increasingly approving of the way the president is handling the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s general approval jumped four points, 49 percent to 53 percent, in less than a week. However, the jump is even greater when narrowed to his “handling” of the coronavirus, specifically. His approval jumped five points, from 51 percent to 56 percent, in a matter of days. That coincides with Trump’s daily coronavirus task force updates and his administration’s push to send checks directly to the American people as part of its “stage 3” proposal for economic relief. On Thursday, Trump spoke at length on specific treatments to combat the virus, including the anti-malaria drug chloroquine. “We’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,” Trump said at Thursday’s briefing. The poll also revealed Trump’s situational approval ratings leaping on nearly all fronts. While stimulating jobs remained steady at 60 percent, the president experienced a one-point jump on the economy and “administering the government,” two points on fighting terrorism and handling immigration, and three points on foreign affairs. Respondents were also asked, “How trustworthy do you think each of the following sources are to provide accurate information regarding the coronavirus outbreak?” Fifty-seven percent of respondents, during the first poll, indicated that the White House and president were trustworthy. That number also jumped four percentage points just days later, boosting to 61 percent. The margin of error was not immediately available.",Poll: Majority Approve of Trump’s Handling of Coronavirus Response,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/poll-majority-approve-of-trumps-handling-of-coronavirus-response/,Breitbart
"The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) is reporting background checks are up 300 percent over where they were at this same time last year. Mark Oliva, NSSF Public Affairs director, told Breitbart News, “FBI NICS informed NSSF that on Monday, March 16, 2020, volume for background checks was 300 percent higher than it was on March 16, 2019.” Oliva added, “Since Feb. 23, background checks have been roughly double every day what they were this time last year.” The Hill reports that gun controllers like Brady Campaign President Kris Brown are warning that more gun ownership means more accidental shootings. Brown said, “We’ve seen increases in firearm purchases in response to uncertain or worrisome current events in the past. Unfortunately, we know that not only do more guns not make you safer, but that the opposite is true.” She added, “Unsafe storage practices correlate to unintentional shootings in the home, what we call ‘Family Fire.’ Everyday, approximately eight children and teens die from these preventable Family Fire incidents.” Brown did not provide any links or substantiation for claiming approximately eight accidental gun deaths for children and teens each day (which works out to approximately 2,900 accidental gun deaths a year). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s figures show a total of 486 accidental gun deaths in 2017 for all age groups combined. That is roughly a sixth of what Brown claimed for one segment of society alone.

"Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley resigned from the Boeing Board of Directors, citing her opposition to President Trump’s administration potentially offering financial assistance to key American industries in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. In a letter dated March 16, Haley announced her resignation as a Boeing board member after being nominated for the position a year ago. Haley cites her economic libertarian principles as the reason she resigned from the Boeing board, writing that she opposes any and all federal aid to American industries suffering in the midst of crisis. Boeing is already the second-largest beneficiary of Defense Department contracts. In 2017, for example, Boeing noted that about 79 percent of its profits came from government contracts with the U.S. federal government. Likewise, Boeing saved about $1.1 billion thanks to tax cuts. Haley writes: I have had the pleasure of working with Boeing for almost ten years now. As South Carolina Governor I came to know the quality of the company, but more importantly, the excellence of the Boeing team and workforce. When I was asked to join the Board of Directors, there was no better team I could think of being a part of. As Boeing has gone through the difficulties of the MAX, I have appreciated the humility and transparency shown by the team to make sure that when the MAX is back in the air, it will be the safest, strongest plane ever flown. [Emphasis added] As we encounter the Covid-19 crisis, Boeing, along with many other companies, face another major set of challenges. I want to be part of helping the company as it pushes through it. However, the board and executive team are going in a direction I cannot support. [Emphasis added] While I know cash is tight, that is equally true for numerous other industries and for millions of small businesses. I cannot support a move to lean on the federal government for a stimulus or bailout that prioritizes our company over others and relies on taxpayers to guarantee our financial position. I have long held strong convictions that this is not the role of government. [Emphasis added] I strongly believe that when one is part of a team, and one cannot in good faith support the direction of the team, then the proper thing to do is to resign. As such, I hereby resign my position from the Boeing Board. [Empahsis added] I hope you all know that I will continue to be a strong supporter of Boeing and its workforce. All of you have taught me so much over the past year. Serving with each and every one of you has been a privilege. I value the friendships I have made with all of you. If I can ever be of help or service to the Boeing team in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Haley’s resignation comes as Trump considers providing federal aid to Boeing amid the coronavirus crisis that has crippled the American airline industry. “We have to protect Boeing,” Trump said this week. “We absolutely have to help Boeing. They were doing a job well, and all of a sudden this hits. So when the airlines aren’t doing well, Boeing’s not going to be doing well, so we’ll be helping Boeing, yeah.” At stake are the jobs of thousands of Americans who work at Boeing, specifically the nearly 7,000 American workers many of whom help build the 787 Dreamliner jet in North Charleston, South Carolina. Boeing is Charleston County’s largest private-sector employer. Haley joined the Boeing Board of Directors last year even as the multinational corporation had a record of outsourcing to foreign countries and offshoring American jobs to foreign workers. As Breitbart News has chronicled, a report late last year detailed outsourced American software jobs to mostly Indian foreign graduates for $9 an hour. In June 2019, reports stated that Boeing’s recent problems with its 737 Max fleet coincided with executives outsourcing U.S. software jobs to foreign workers through HCL Technologies Ltd. — an India-based outsourcing firm. Similarly, in 2018, Boeing executives announced their plans to outsource a manufacturing plant to Bengaluru, India, where 3,000 Indian workers would be employed.

"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says “autopsies on decedents with known or suspected COVID-19 should be conducted in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms,” in a guidance released to medical professionals on February 20. In addition, the CDC guidance says Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGP) ” such as use of an oscillating bone saw should be avoided for confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.” “If an oscillating saw is used, attach a vacuum shroud to contain aerosols,” the CDC cautions. The Washington State Department of Health issued its own guidance last week to funeral homes handling deceased cases of COVID-19 that elaborated on the earlier CDC guidance. Washington has seen at least 68 deaths from COVID-19 as of Thursday, the highest of any state in the country: This document is to provide guidance for preventing infection in mortuary and funeral home workers who handle deceased persons with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is most often spread by respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. Transmission from respiratory droplets is not a concern when handling human remains or performing postmortem procedures. However, mortuary and funeral home workers should take precautions to avoid contact with potentially infectious body fluids. In addition to following “standard precautions,” the State of Washington guidance advises medical professionals that: COVID-19 could potentially be transmitted by infectious aerosols generated by using an oscillating saw, suctioning body fluids, or other aerosol generating procedure. If aerosol
generating procedures are anticipated, refer to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance for postmortem specimens from deceased persons under investigation for COVID-19 for information on procedures that should be avoided, additional safety precautions, ventilation requirements, and respiratory protection. In Snohomish County, Washington, where four people have died from COVID-19 as of Thursday, the County Medical Examiner’s office issued the following guidance: If a decedent meets any of the [COVID-19] criteria, the Snohomish Health District is notified and a SCMEO medical investigator responds to the scene and transports the decedent to the SCMEO for further examination/testing.  Upon arriving to the SCMEO, the decedents are placed in a special isolation refrigerator.  The decision to perform an autopsy or test for the COVID-19 virus, or other viruses such as influenza, is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with public health authorities. If an autopsy is performed, the pathologist and autopsy technicians performing the examination use the same standard personal protective equipment (PPE) that is used during routine autopsies.  The exams are conducted in an isolated, negative pressure, autopsy suite utilizing airborne precautions.  The suite is disinfected thoroughly following each exam. The pathologist and autopsy technicians performing the exam follow Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines when collecting swab and tissue specimens in addition to those collected during routine autopsies.  Following the exam, the specimens collected are transported to the Washington State Department of Health Public Health Laboratory in Shoreline, WA for testing. Though these precautionary guidelines for the conducting of autopsies on victims of COVID-19 have not been widely reported, it comes as little surprise that the CDC, several state departments of health, and local county health departments have been quick to provide them to medical professionals who may be at risk.",CDC: Autopsies on COVID-19 Victims Should Be Conducted in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/cdc-autopsies-on-covid-19-victims-should-be-conducted-in-airborne-infection-isolation-rooms/,Breitbart
"A millennial single mom I know happened to be in a supermarket located in a North Shore suburb of Chicago Sunday when Governor J.B. Pritzker announced he had decided to close all of the restaurants and bars in Illinois. As shoppers began getting news updates on their smartphones, she said there was a dramatic increase in the “intensity” of their shopping. People were moving quickly and scooping large quantities of anything they could get their hands on into their shopping carts. Within minutes, the shelves were nearly bare.  Welcome to scarcity. Welcome to panic. Welcome to everyday socialism. Before the current panic over the Chinese Virus, Illinois was the most fiscally unstable state in the union. Governor Pritzker presides over a state with a budget deficit of $1.3 billion and a state debt of $64 billion. In addition, the public employee pension fund has a current unfunded liability of $137 billion. Governor Pritzker’s big-government counterpart in Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, is presiding over a current budget deficit of $838 million and a city that is $32.5 billion in debt. The Chicago Teachers’ Union has a current unfunded pension obligation of $11 billion. Both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago were already struggling under the weight of a bloated and smothering government prior to this health crisis. With the second largest exodus rate of any of the 50 states (6.5 per 1,000 residents in 2018; only Alaska was higher), the people of Illinois were voting with their feet and fleeing (as a former resident of Illinois, I can attest to this trend firsthand).  Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that a state so addicted to big government has now eagerly embraced the crisis as an opportunity to enact even more big government measures. The governor, with Mayor Lightfoot at his side, has clearly decided that the people in Springfield are the only ones capable of directing the daily activities of Illinois residents. The people are fools, the government is wise, and we lowly, common citizens need our choices made for us. What people in the United States are going to get a glimpse of over the next several weeks, especially the people in Illinois, is what life would look like in a world controlled by Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, or “The Squad.”   This is government directed life. This is life filled with shortages, frustrating and nonsensical decisions, and privileges extended to preferred “comrades.”  We are being visited by the ghost of socialism’s future. In his press conference Sunday, and earlier in the day while appearing on one of the Sunday morning talk shows, Pritzker said he was upset people hadn’t followed his instructions more closely to stay home. “The time for persuasion and public appeal is over. The time for action is now. This is not a joke.”  It certainly isn’t. In Champaign, Illinois, last Friday the mayor invoked an emergency ordinance giving the local government the power to prohibit the sale of firearms, ammunition, and alcohol during the “crisis.”  But he still kept the polls open on Tuesday. Regardless, for a moment let’s give Pritzker and the mayors of Champaign and Chicago the benefit of the doubt. Let’s concede that the severity of the virus warrants these decisions. Now let’s imagine what life in America would be like if these types of changes became permanent.  When the government takes control of economic activity, they replace the efficiencies of the free market with a determined market. Many people don’t stop to realize that nobody plans what is or isn’t on store shelves. There’s no central planner. It happens spontaneously under the direction of the invisible hand of supply and demand. When Governor Pritzker, or any other politician, replaces the decisions of millions of independently acting citizens with their own preferences (however well intentioned), it’s inevitable that you won’t be able to find what you want, more importantly what you need, on store shelves or anywhere else in the marketplace. You might be thinking, “Yes Charlie, but these are extraordinary times! Certainly, these are short-term measures due to the current pandemic.” Perhaps, but never put it past a political opportunist from grabbing power during a crisis. These “short-term” emergency powers are eerily similar to the “long-term” plans of Bernie Sanders and his kind. Regardless of your personal position, and regardless of how bad this pandemic gets, I’m certain of at least one thing—it will come to an end. It is now that our devotion and commitment to liberty, freedom, personal property, the Bill of Rights and the rule of law will be truly tested. Let us look to democratic South Korea, which has maintained a free and open society as it’s successfully battled the virus — and not Communist China, which has lied to the world about the severity of the virus, and just recently kicked out U.S. reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. We have no idea of whether their claims of being past peak pandemic are true or not.    Possibly the only pandemic harder to blunt than the Chinese coronavirus is our nation’s recent infatuation with socialism. While you should take whatever actions necessary to protect you and your family, I urge you to pay attention. Witness with your own two eyes the consequence of fear, scarcity and central planning. The ghost of socialism’s future is giving you a glimpse.

"Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is the latest high-profile political figure to push vote-by-mail in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, writing in an op-ed on Thursday that, come November, we must “bring the ballot box” to voters. The former presidential candidate detailed her call for a vote-by-mail option for November’s general election in an op-ed for the Washington Post on Thursday. “The coronavirus should not stop our citizens from casting their ballots,” she said, outlining the stakes in November’s elections, which involve 11 gubernatorial elections, seats covering the entirety of the U.S. House of Representatives and over one-third of the Senate, and, of course, the presidency. Citing the election delays in both Louisiana and Georgia and warning of an event where “Americans might have to choose between casting a ballot and protecting their health,” Klobuchar formally called for vote-by-mail to be made available to every eligible voter in the country, come November. She wrote: The best way to ensure that this virus doesn’t keep people from the ballot box is to bring the ballot box to them. We must allow every American the ability to vote by mail. And we must expand early voting so that voters who are not able to vote by mail are not exposed to the elevated infection risks of long lines and crowded polling locations. The lawmaker added that they will introduce the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020, which she says will “help election officials meet this pandemic head-on.” “Our legislation will guarantee every voter a secure mail-in paper ballot and help states cover the cost of printing, self-sealing envelopes, ballot tracking and postage,” she explained, calling vote-by mail a “time-tested, reliable way for Americans to exercise their constitutional rights.” “Our legislation would also expand early voting to avoid lines where the virus could spread and help states recruit young poll workers so that older Americans who typically step up on Election Day can stay home,” she added. Klobuchar’s call for vote-by-mail follows Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) requesting state lawmakers to authorize all-mail elections for August and November — a request fully backed by Arizona Senate Democrats: We wholeheartedly agree, @SecretaryHobbs, and we already have a bill by @seanbowie that would do just that.

As Breitbart News detailed: Several states already allow voting by mail, though Republicans have warned that California’s system is vulnerable to fraud. There, Democrats legalized a system called “ballot harvesting,” which allows unverified third parties to deliver each other’s ballots — effectively allowing party organizers to bring thousands of ballots to be counted. Republicans blamed some of their 2018 losses in California on “ballot harvesting.” And Republican efforts to copy Democrats’ tactics have failed because Republicans are generally more reluctant to give their ballots to others. Five states have postponed their primary elections. Those include Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, Maryland, and Ohio.","Amy Klobuchar Demands Vote-by-Mail, Calls It ‘Time-Tested, Reliable’",2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/amy-klobuchar-demands-vote-by-mail-calls-it-time-tested-reliable/,Breitbart
"A college student is helping elderly people in her California neighborhood who are stuck at home to avoid getting infected with the coronavirus by delivering needed goods for free and at least one describes Alex Dewey as an “angel.” The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Dewey, who is a student at College of Marin, and her volunteer business, inspired by a notice on Nextdoor, an online social network that connects neighbors: Mary Aversano’s doctors told her two years ago that she had about a year left to live. Her cancer is metastatic, spread from the uterus to the liver and lungs. Still, at 76, the San Rafael woman is mobile enough to get out of the house a few times a week — “It’s a rotten disease,” she said, “but I’m not going to let it get me” — and she did her own grocery shopping until recently, when the new coronavirus began to spread. She worried she would catch the virus in a store, exposing herself and possibly her husband, who suffers from chronic heart disease. Her fears increased as the news worsened, and she considered herself luckier than friends who were more housebound or lived by themselves: “There are people out there alone and scared and disabled.” Aversano was reluctant to accept, not wanting to seem needy, but she got over that sensation.  “You know what, you old broad,” Aversano said, “suck it up and let somebody help.” Turns out about a dozen other people decided to take Dewey up on her offer and about 30 young people offered to help her if she needed backup. “Right now, it’s stuff that I can do easily,” Dewey, 21, said in the Chronicle article.  Dewey is studying business administration and economics at the college, which, like all other schools in California, is closed in the wake of the coronivirus. Dewey told the Chronicle that she made her offer on Nextdoor when thinking about her grandparents, who live in the hard-hit Seattle area and have health issues. “They’re from the generation where they don’t like to lean on anyone,” Dewey said. On Monday — the same day six bay area counties announced a shelter-in-place order that would take effect at midnight — Dewey and her mother went to several stores and got what they could for the people on their list, but many stores had empty shelves. The Chronicle reported: The night’s fourth and last delivery was to Aversano. By the time Dewey arrived at Aversano’s house on a quiet street in San Rafael, it was 8 p.m. and dark out. The porch light was on, and Aversano emerged, wearing dark glasses and a pink pullover. “Oh my god,” Aversano said, thanking Dewey for a bag of brown sugar, maple syrup, and her favorite yogurt. Dewey said she hopes to somehow expand her services. “It’s clear that there’s this need for it,” she said. “And more people are doing it.”  And her customers appreciate Dewy’s kindness. Dewey, Aversano said, “was like an angel at my door.”",Coronavirus: California College Student Delivering Goods to Elderly Shut-Ins for Free,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/coronavirus-california-college-student-delivering-goods-to-elderly-shut-ins-for-free/,Breitbart
"The Whole of America  On March 13, President Trump declared a “whole of America approach” to fighting the coronavirus.  And on March 17, he reinforced  that point, tweeting, “The world is at war with a hidden enemy.  WE WILL WIN!”  And at his press conference on March 18, the self-described “wartime president” emphasized, “We’re going to win, we’re going to come back.” Thus we can see, the president is determined to set a tone of militant activist optimism; he pledged a stronger healthcare system in the future, but before we get there, he added, “We have to win the war first.” As we shall see, this all-together-now “whole of America approach” has worked before to bring victory–and the greatest victory for the Whole of America, of course, was World War Two.  President Donald Trump holds a news conference at the White House detailing the “Whole of America” approach to defeating the coronavirus pandemic, March 13, 2020. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) U.S. participation in that conflict began with the Japanese sneak-attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  Today, nearly eighty years later, many are familiar with President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous oration to Congress and the nation the following day, when he cited December 7 as the “date that will live in infamy.” As FDR also said:  No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. That was exactly the right tone: Win. Win at any cost.  President Franklin D. Roosevelt speaks to the nation from the White House on Dec. 9, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. (AP Photo) Less remembered is FDR’s “fireside chat” of December 9, 1941, carried to the nation on radio, in which the 33rd president laid out the scope for the Whole of America:  We are now in this war.  We are all in it—all the way.  Every single man, woman, and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history.  We must share together the bad news and the good news, the defeats and the victories—the changing fortunes of war. Interestingly, FDR focused on two key elements of this “partnership” approach, both of which he deemed vital.  And it’s interesting, as well, to take note of the precise sequence in which he placed these two elements.  First, FDR cited the proper role of the press, as well as the need to suppress rumor-mongering.  Second, he cited the need to boost war-production.   Both elements offer lessons for today.  The Whole of America Then: The Press  As FDR said in that December 9, 1941, chat with the nation, what we now know as “the media” had a special responsibility: To all newspapers and radio stations—all those who reach the eyes and ears of the American people—I say this: You have a most grave responsibility to the Nation now and for the duration of this war. And that responsibility, of course, was not to publish rumors, enemy propaganda, or defeatism.  As Roosevelt put it: Most earnestly I urge my countrymen to reject all rumors.  These ugly little hints of complete disaster fly thick and fast in wartime.  They have to be examined and appraised. As an example, FDR added: Many rumors and reports which we now hear originate with enemy sources. For instance, today the Japanese are claiming that as a result of their one action against Hawaii they have gained naval supremacy in the Pacific.  This is an old trick of propaganda which has been used innumerable times by the Nazis.  The purposes of such fantastic claims are, of course, to spread fear and confusion among us, and to goad us into revealing military information which our enemies are desperately anxious to obtain. A phase often used in those days was “fifth column.”  That is, a country could be attacked by an enemy column of troops or tanks from four directions—east, north, south, west—and that was bad enough.   And yet the most dangerous column was the fifth column, the enemy column from within.  FDR told America that the national government and the people should stick together and reject dangerous rumor-mongering: Our Government will not be caught in this obvious trap—and neither will the people of the United States. So now today, we must all be equally vigilant against rumor-mongering and panic-encouraging.  One vigilant watcher is Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary to George W. Bush.  On March 13, Fleischer tweeted caustic criticism of CNN, quoting what the cable channel was saying, and then adding his own slam on the network:  “There will be a pandemic.  And it will have the potential to bring humanity to its knees.”   So began a promo I just saw for a show that will air on CNN.  This type of promo is the kind irresponsible fear-mongering that should be avoided.  CNN should change its advertising. Fleischer is right: CNN ought to be ashamed of itself.  And if it isn’t, then Americans should heap shame on the network, as a warning signal to other media outlets that might be tempted to jeopardize public order for the sake of ratings and clicks.  The Whole of America Then: War Production The second element of FDR’s Whole American strategy was beefing up military manufacturing.   In an earlier fireside chat, on December 29, 1940, the president had pledged that American forges and foundries would be the world’s “arsenal of democracy.” And yet now, a little less than a year later, American factories would be needed, first, to equip the United States military, and second, to equip our allies around the world.  As FDR put it: I have been working today on the subject of production.  Your Government has decided on two broad policies.  The first is to speed up all existing production by working on a seven-day-week basis in every war industry, including the production of essential raw materials.  The second policy, now being put into form, is to rush additions to the capacity of production by building more new plants, by adding to old plants, and by using the many smaller plants for war needs. So we’re getting the picture; as this author has noted in the past here at Breitbart News, U.S. mobilization during World War Two was a wonder to behold.  The wondrously huge surge in production—as FDR said, “working on a seven-day week basis . . . building more new plants”—gave us a relatively quick victory on the battlefront.   Also, interestingly, this wartime surge gave us generously overtimed prosperity on the homefront.  In fact, a great many Breitbart News readers look back with pride as they recall what their grandfathers, grandmothers, and others accomplished, working line jobs at defense plants such as Michigan’s legendary Willow Run.  Indeed, these many decades later, the testimony of Breitbart News readers is inspiring. The B-24 assembly line, 1943, Willow Run Plant. (Source: The Henry Ford/Flickr) Women Riveting a B-24, 1944, Willow Run Plant (Source: The Henry Ford/Flickr) During the war, the positive results of surging war production were evident as early as May 1942, just five months after Pearl Harbor, when the U.S. Navy won a strategic victory over the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of the Coral Sea.  It takes nothing away from the fortitude and heroism of our sea dogs in the Pacific to note that they were greatly bolstered by working stiffs at the shipyards and factories back home.   And the rest of the war, of course, is history—a glorious epic of the Whole of America, All In.   B-24 Liberator bombers of the U.S. 8th Air Force flying towards their targets in occupied Europe on Aug. 12, 1943. (AP Photo) The Whole of America Today  In the White House Rose Garden on the 13th, Trump was generous in his praise of retailers Wal-Mart, CVS, Target, and Walgreens.  He also included, and thanked, such medical firms as Thermo Risher, LabCorp, and Quest.  Indeed, he even thanked Google for committing itself to building a website that would help Americans locate a corona testing center. Such inclusion puzzled some critics of corporate America.  One such is Matt Stoller, a thoughtful liberal, who tweeted: Trump has so far thanked Google, Roche, large hospital systems, giant lab companies, and big pharma.  The Trump administration does not believe in doing work, so they ask monopolists to do it for them. In fact, Trump hasn’t always been a fan of corporate America, especially of Silicon Valley tech companies such as Google.   Yet the Whole of America Approach requires a leader to stay focused on the prime objective, which, in this instance, is defeating the coronavirus.   So that can mean welcoming new allies, bringing special skills, provided that they are willing to help pull the oar.  With this new need for unity, and competence, in mind, a Silicon Valley start-up investor, Balaji S. Srinivasan, had the better point when he tweeted a response to Stoller:  This is where I disagree with Matt.  The federal government has failed.  CDC can’t run tests at scale.  FDA doesn’t understand what an emergency is.  Biopharma can manufacture drugs and vaccines, Labcorp/Quest can run tests, Google can certainly build websites.  Let them get at it. Yes, exactly: Let them get at it.  Let those with the skills we need go to the front lines of production—and hopefully, it will all be made in U.S.A. In fact, just on March 18, the Detroit News reported that General Motors and Ford are exploring ways that they can shift their auto-manufacturing capacity toward the manufacturing of breathing ventilators for severely afflicted corona patients. We can pause to note that this is exactly the sort of home-grown can-do that we need at a time such as this.  That is, we need good patriotic spirit from the business community, and we need the machinery, and the machinists, to be close at hand, within our borders, so that those industrial and human assets can be immediately repurposed for the saving of lives. Critics will say that this sort of urgent manufacturing comes at the of inefficiency, and perhaps profiteering.  And such critics have a point—but only up to a point.  It’s true that doing anything hastily brings risk, but in this crisis, not acting with haste could cost many lives. We’ll sort out everything later and assign credit (and, as needed, blame) accordingly, but first, let’s beat this virus. As they say in the Army, “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.” Today, the main thing is the coronavirus. GM president William S. Knudsen, who served as Chief of Production of the Army during World War Two, circa 1942. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Once again, we can look back to the helpful Whole American precedent.   During World War, FDR brought in many top business leaders to oversee war production.   The most important of these was William S. Knudsen, president of General Motors, who was appointed chairman of the newly created Office of Production Management.  In his government post, Knudsen worked for the princely sum of one dollar a year.  In fact, in those days, there were quite a few “dollar-a-year men” in the government, applying their business skills to the challenge of ramping up defense production.    We might pause to note that FDR was not overly trusting of businessmen and corporate America.  And yet at the same time, he was no socialist; he believed that the private sector was the proper hub for most production—a lesson we had learned in World War One—and furthermore, that businessmen were patriots.  So he brought in the businessmen, and thus the military, as well as the country as a whole, benefited greatly from their managerial talents.  (So now, today, of course, we need dollar-a-year men and dollar-a-year women.) Yet even so, FDR was always a trust-but-verify guy.  Yes, he made good use of Knudsen & Co., but that didn’t mean that General Motors, or any of the thousands of  companies involved in the defense effort, were exempt from taxation and regulation. So yes, companies were making good profits during World War Two, and yet they were paying a lot in taxes, and also, crucially, they were sharing the wealth with their workers.  The Whole of America: Workers  It’s a positive sign that Trump is working with business.  As we have seen, government and business, together, can get a lot done.  And yet there’s still a missing piece: labor.  That is, just as Trump met with business leaders on the 13th, he would do well to hold a similar event with American workers and their representatives, including labor union leaders.  Here again, the successes of the past should serve as a prologue for the future: On Labor Day, 1941, as the world war was gathering, but not yet on our shores, FDR said:  American labor now bears a tremendous responsibility in the winning of this most brutal, most terrible of all wars.  In our factories and shops and arsenals we are building weapons on a scale great in its magnitude.  So we can see: In heaping praise on labor, Roosevelt was also pinning duty on labor.  That is, workers had to actually run the arsenal of democracy, and do so with the utmost sense of relentless resolve.     Yet at the same time, FDR realized that labor had to be fully integrated into the nation, as well as the national production system.  As he also said on Labor Day 1941: The present position of labor in the United States as an interdependent unit in the life of the Nation has not come about by chance.  It has been an evolutionary process of a healthy democracy at work. Indeed, Roosevelt’s New Deal had secured the rights of labor, through such landmark pieces of legislation as the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as well as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  These bills gave labor—and labor unions—a place at the national table.  And with a place at the table comes, of course, the placing of responsibility, and duty.  Labor fully stepped up.   A famous war production poster from the early 40s  shows how the national bargain worked.  The poster depicts the rough-gloved hand of a worker shaking the well manicured hand of a businessman.  And in between, the hand of Uncle Sam.  The caption: “Together We Win.”   Thus it all added up to success.  As FDR said in 1943, “Dr. New Deal” was being joined, now, by “Dr. Win the War.”  And that’s what happened—the two doctors’ prescriptions won the war.   So today, we need government, business, and labor—working together.  As top presidential adviser Jared Kushner told The Washington Post on March 19, “In America, some of our best resources are in our private sector. The federal government is not designed to solve all our problems; a lot of the muscle is in the private sector and there’s also a lot of smart people.”  Again, the issue is synergies–all cooperating with all.   Putting All the Pieces Together for the Whole America  Actually, though, we need more than just the tripartite alliance of government, business and labor.  We also need bipartisanship on the big things.    To be sure, nobody is under any illusions about the depths of division that the country has sunk into during the last few years, and yet now we’ve found something much worse: the medical and social threat of the coronavirus.  So perhaps now that peril will force Democrats and Republicans to work together. Thus it was interesting that on March 14, in the wake of a key next step in a bipartisan corona legislation, Trump tweeted, “Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill.  People really pulled together.  Nice to see!”   We might recall that back on December 8, 1941, the declaration of war against Japan sailed through the Senate on a vote of 88:0, and the House, 418:1. To be sure, there’s still more to be done.  For instance, Trump designated Sunday, March 15, as a National Day of Prayer.  As we’ve figured out by now, we need all the help we can get—and there’s no greater aid and comfort than that which can come from Providence.   And yes, there’s plenty of precedent, too, for powerful prayer.  On January 1, 1942, less than a month after Pearl Harbor, FDR declared a National Day of Prayer.  Indeed, there were many other occasions during the war when Roosevelt led the nation in beseeching the Almighty.    Of course, the most famous of these godly moments came on D-Day, June 6, 1944, when the president’s radio broadcast to the nation included a hymn to faithful national unity: O Lord, give us faith.  Give us faith in Thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade.  Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled.  Let not the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but fleeting moment—let not these deter us in our unconquerable purpose. Yes, in so many ways, the 33rd president set a high bar.  He showed how the bully pulpit could elevate the spirit of the nation and guide it toward winning Whole Americanism.   So now we’ll have to see what the 45th president can do.",Pinkerton: How the ‘Whole of America Approach’ Won World War Two and Can Win the Coronavirus War,2020-03-19,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/19/pinkerton-how-the-whole-of-america-approach-won-world-war-two-and-can-win-the-coronavirus-war/,Breitbart
"London mayor Sadiq Khan has complained that it is “disgraceful” to refer to the Wuhan coronavirus as “Chinese”, insisting it is a “global virus”. “Covid-19 is Covid-19,” Khan declared to the London Assembly following a question from Unmesh Desai, who like the Mayor is a member of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party. “It is not a Chinese virus, and to use words like that are disgraceful [sic], and is the sort of language that leads to incitement and hatred towards people of Chinese origin,” he alleged. “We are a city that celebrates our diversity and we think it is a strength, not a weakness, and it’s really important that we don’t follow into the trap of some to use this virus as an excuse to denigrate, demean, and dehumanise people,” he continued. “And what’s really important is if we see people picked on, discriminated against, because of this virus, we act to stand with them in solidarity — but also the police will continue to have a zero-tolerance approach towards any form of hate crime,” he threatened. “[W]e need a global response to this global virus, coming together rather than using this as another excuse to divide communities and divide countries and divide nations and divide ethnicities,” he insisted. #Coronavirus: The coronavirus is not ‘Chinese’.

The Brexit Part leader believes President Trump was absolutely right to lay the blame for the virus at the Chinese Communist Party’s door, partly through permitting cruel and unhygenic “wet markets” where “living, dead or dying creatures as diverse as bats, pangolins and other [creatures] are held in close proximity, their body fluids and all the bacteria, viruses and parasites they carry mixing and mutating in direct contact with human shoppers,” but mainly through its efforts to actively cover-up the disease’s emergence and aggressively silence whistleblowers during its early stages. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, associating diseases with a particular place or nationality was uncontroversial — as with, for example, German measles, Spanish flu, or Ebola, which is named for the Ebola River in Africa — and indeed many mainstream media outlets on the coronavirus referred to it as the “Wuhan virus” during their early reporting on it. The Chinese regime, which is currently engaged in spreading rumours that the virus was seeded in Wuhan by the U.S. Army, applied strong pressure to put a stop to this.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) saying Trump should be replaced, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) ignoring him entirely. Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) compared Trump to Hitler last Sunday, an astonishingly tone-deaf attack in a time of crisis. But the tide had already begun to turn last Friday, when Trump appeared with business leaders in the Rose Garden as he declared a national emergency. The message: this is serious, and Americans are stepping up to help. The country saw people uniting around the president — which is what we needed to see. Democrats could have been part of that tableau, but they, and the media, kept suggesting that it was more important to replace him. Hence the boomlet in media praise for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who thanked Trump for speedy federal help, but then accused the administration of causing “chaos.” That ended quickly, after Trump called Cuomo out, telling him to “do more.” What seemed at first like a tit-for-tat Twitter spat was the president’s way of enforcing unity in wartime. Cuomo got the message, and more Democrats began to fall in line behind the effort. Former Democratic Party presidential candidate Andrew Yang led the way, offering support to the White House after it began to consider sending $1,000 checks directly to American families, picking up an idea he suggested during his campaign. Yang, with his experience in business and philanthropy, understood that pulling together in times of crisis did not mean giving up on political dissent, but meant putting the country’s immediate needs first. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden didn’t get the memo. And the media, as usual, were late catching up. Journalists in the White House Briefing Room shouted questions about “racism” because Trump had the temerity to call coronavirus a “Chinese virus” — which it is — in response to China spreading false conspiracy theories about the U.S. military spawning the pandemic. The Atlantic declared Trump’s presidency “over.” Politico proclaimed the “End of Trumpism.” Hollywood celebrities retweeted their demand: “The president needs to resign.” But the country had moved on. The grocery supply chain — farmers, workers, truckers — worked hard to re-stock the shelves. The “gig economy,” targeted by many in the political establishment, sprang into action, providing crucial delivery services. And as the Trump rolled out his relief plans, working with Congress, Democrats began praising Trump. Rep. Ilhan Omar of the “Squad” called Trump’s leadership “incredible.” Even CNN’s Dana Bash praised Trump. The conventional wisdom at the start of this crisis was that Trump’s tool kit — his preference for good news, his emphasis on the stock market, and of course his tweets — was unsuited to the task of managing the outbreak. But experience proved the opposite. His early instinct to close the borders was a salvation. Even his narcissism has made him more effective: he knows this is his task. Everything in his life thus far has prepared him for this moment. There may be hard times ahead. Two weeks ago, the country was celebrating a “blockbuster” jobs report; we may soon see millions of layoffs. But the president — and the experts — say that we can make a rapid comeback. “Make America Great Again” was the best campaign slogan in the history of American politics. Maligned by the media, cast falsely as a racist symbol, “MAGA” is the new national mission. We can be great again, and we will. Joel B.

"ROME — The death toll of Catholic clergy in Italy from Chinese coronavirus has now reached at least 13, as three more priests died this week in less than 72 hours. The three priests who died most recently all worked in Milan: 82-year-old Father Marco Barbetta, who had been chaplain of the Polytechnic Univeristy, Father Luigi Giussani, 70 years old, the vicar of the parish of San Protaso in via Osoppo, and 63-year-old Monsignor Ezio Fioravante Bisello, vice-rector of the Milan cathedral, local media reported. In the case of Father Barbetta, who passed away on Tuesday, the death was caused primarily by a previous heart condition aggravated by the coronavirus, as has occurred in a considerable number of other cases. Father Luigi Giussani, who bore the same name as the founder of the Comunione e liberazione movement, died on Wednesday, while Monsignor Bisello, deputy master of ceremonies at the cathedral, died Thursday. On Monday, Catholic News Agency (CNA) reported that at least ten priests had already died in Italy from COVID-19, more than half of them from the hard-hit Diocese of Bergamo. Bishop Francesco Beschi of Bergamo said Monday that 20 priests in his diocese had been hospitalized and six of them had died. “The number of priests who have died this week and that of those who are still in a particularly serious situation is very high,” the bishop said in a radio interview. “We are living this pain by sharing it with that of our communities together with the number of infected people, the sick and a high number of deaths. We are not separated from our community even in the passage of death,” Breschi said. Three other priests have died in the northern Diocese of Brescia, one of whom tended to the terminally ill in a nearby hospice. Another of the clerics to succumb to the disease was Monsignor Vincenzo Rini of the Diocese of Cremona, who died on March 14. Rini reportedly ran Cremona’s diocesan newspaper for 30 years. As of Thursday evening, more than 40,000 people in Italy have been infected with the coronavirus and 3,405 people have died in less than a month. Over 4,000 (4,440) people who previously tested positive for the virus have now recovered.

"BERGAMO, Italy (AP) — The priest gave a final benediction. There were no flowers, no embraces. Francesca Steffanoni and her mother hurried away from Bergamo’s main cemetery, their furtive farewell lasting no more than 5 minutes. Bergamo is the epicentre of the hardest-hit province of Italy’s hardest-hit region, Lombardy, the site of hundreds of coronavirus deaths. Families here are deprived of a bedside farewell with virus-stricken loved ones, or even a traditional funeral, and the cemetery is so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks transported 65 bodies to a neighbouring region for cremation this week. Steffanoni had taken her mother to watch as the coffin containing an 82-year-old relative — a widower with a heart condition, struck down with the virus — was driven inside the imposing gates. They wore masks and gloves; they kept their distance. “In theory, we should not have gone. But it was one of her last relatives who remains,” Steffanoni said. According to unofficial figures, more than 600 people infected with the virus have died in the province, which is tucked up against the Italian Alps and accounts for more than a quarter of all deaths in Lombardy, even though it represents only a tenth of the region’s population of 10 million. “We are confronting the biggest Covid emergency after Wuhan,” said Dr Luca Lorini, head of intensive care at Bergamo’s main hospital, named for native son Pope John XXIII, where nearly 500 beds are dedicated to people suffering severe symptoms of the virus, 80 of those in intensive care. “The numbers tell us this.” But the numbers thus far don’t tell the whole story. Provincial mayors are sounding an alarm that the virus-related toll fails to reflect a spike in deaths in the general population among those who have not been tested. Last week alone, 400 people died in Bergamo and 12 neighbouring towns — four times the number who died the same week the previous year, according to the Bergamo mayor’s office. Only 91 of those had tested positive for the virus. People on the front lines of the virus fight, including hospital officials, funeral operators, city administrators and union leaders, told The Associated Press that Bergamo’s crisis might have been prevented had their individual requests to create a red zone around the area as early as Feb. 23 been heeded. Instead, strict containment measures were extended to Bergamo only on March 8, two weeks later, without ever isolating two valley towns where the outbreak was first recorded. Farage: Communist China Regime Responsible for Virus ‘Nightmare’ https://t.co/xWJCmj7Ie3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 19, 2020  “When the virus arrived here, there was no containment and it spread through the valleys very quickly. … Some said it was the normal flu. We doctors knew it was not,” Lorini said. Funeral parlours already were registering an alarming increase in deaths starting in January and February, an anomaly they signalled to officials, said Antonio Ricciardi, head of a local funeral parlour association. His business handled 611 funerals from March 1-18, when the usual pace is just over 100 in a full month. After the first death in nearby Alzano Lombardo was recorded and other cases confirmed on Feb. 23, doctors at the Pope John XXIII Hospital set up an emergency ICU to handle virus patients. That was two days after the lockdown of 10 towns in southern Lombardy, which has been largely declared a success and served as a model for the nationwide shutdown instituted March 9. No official explanation has been given for the decision not to extend red-zone status to Bergamo. Regional welfare official Giulio Gallera acknowledged the question but said he didn’t want to place blame, adding “we are in a situation in which the entire region has substantially adopted particularly rigid measures.” Eliana Como of the influential FIOM metalworkers union said she believes the area’s economic significance played a role in the decision not to place a red zone around towns at the mouth of the Seriana Valley, home to steel production and artisanal workshops. “I think the business interests weighed heavily on the decision,” said Como, who lives in Bergamo. In the epidemic’s fourth week, Lorini estimates that the true number of infected in the area is 5 to 10 times the official figure of 4,645. The current regimen allows testing only of people who show up at a screening area at the hospital with severe symptoms, missing people who are sick at home. “We believe the true numbers [of Covid-19-related deaths] are hidden,” said Francesco Alleva, spokesman for Bergamo’s mayor. “Because many people are dying at home or in structures for the elderly, and they have never been tested for the virus.” That uncertain toll is at the heart of officials’ constant appeals for people to stay home. Police cars circulate Bergamo with loudspeakers instructing people not to go out except for true necessities, such as work or grocery shopping. To further discourage people from leaving their homes, Mayor Giorgio Gori this week turned off the public wi-fi and closed down gambling machines in tobacco shops, which remain open and where people can also pay some bills. Though the increase in positive diagnoses has narrowed from some 500 a day this past weekend to over 300 on Thursday, Lorini said it would take until at least next week to determine if the containment measures were having an impact. The inability to comfort virus-stricken family members in the hospital or even attend a funeral has been among the most wrenching aspects of the still-unfolding emergency. Hospital wards try to help by phoning updates to loved ones and allowing phone calls when patients start to recover. But when death is near, Lorini said, a visit would be “a useless explosion of contagion.” “It is terrible to lose a loved one and not be able to hug them. But that is what has happened in epidemics for a thousand years, and what will also happen for the next thousand years,” Lorini said. Once a loved one with the virus dies, family members are not permitted to choose a favourite outfit for burial. By government decree, the dead are buried in the clothes they died in, wrapped in sterile blankets and placed inside coffins as quickly as possible. “There is a huge psychological issue for family members who cannot see the body,” Ricciardi said. “Without a body, it is hard to realize a death occurred.” The sobering toll hits in full force with just a glance at the local newspaper, L’Eco di Bergamo, which has seen the number of pages dedicated to death notices multiply from one to nine, 10, even 11 pages. In a notice in Wednesday’s edition, the family members of Bruno Maffeis, who died at age 66, expressed a “heartfelt thank you to the doctors and personnel of Pope John Hospital in Bergamo, and in particular to Dr. Carlo Fino for his generous availability.” “As specified by the government, the funeral will be celebrated at a future date to be decided,” the notice said.

"Nigel Farage has said that the Chinese coronavirus has exposed the West’s dependence on China in its supply chains, and he hopes the pandemic inspires Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reconsider his decision to allow Huawei to help build Britain’s 5G network. “The West’s supply chains have become too dependent on China,” the Brexit Party leader wrote in Newsweek. Referencing President Xi Jinping’s government offering support to Serbia and Italy over the Wuhan virus, Mr Farage said: “To see China now exploiting a crisis that they have caused to spread their influence further and deeper into Europe should send a chill down our spines.” Criticising those who benefit from ties with China, the Brexiteer added: “I have pointed out before that many members of our big business class, of the civil service, and indeed of our political class are increasingly in the pay of China. “They ought to take their noses out of the trough and have a think. Their financial wellbeing is not above the good of our nation.” Farage: Communist China Regime Responsible for Virus ‘Nightmare’ https://t.co/xWJCmj7Ie3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 19, 2020  Former international trade secretary Dr Liam Fox has made similar observations on how the pandemic has exposed the fragility of globalisation and the global market, with the British economy less resilient than it would be if it manufactured more goods in-country rather than relying on imports from foreign countries like China. “I think what it is showing us is that while the ‘just in time’ supply chain in the global economy may provide us with efficiency in the global economy, it doesn’t provide us with resilience in the global economy. I think that’s something we will need to look at after because it’s clear that now the concept of ‘over there’ does not exist in a global economy, and a disruption in one part will very quickly become a disruption elsewhere,” Dr Fox said earlier this month. The Conservative MP added that the outbreak should prompt the UK to look at making more ourselves — “import substitution” — as well as to reevaluate “the trend to run down stocks and run down warehousing” in order to “increase resilience should we face something like this in the future, which is likely, because pandemics are the norm in human history, not the exception”. Mr Farage also took aim at the prime minister’s decision to allow Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei to help build the British 5G network, saying, “if nothing else, Boris Johnson must see that his decision… is the wrong one.” Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partners Australia and the United States have warned against allowing the Chinese corporation access to British networks over national security concerns.

"Atlanta (AP) — Grammy-winning hip hop recording artist Lecrae joined forces with non-profit organization Thursday to assemble and distribute portable hand-washing stations throughout Atlanta in areas with a high density of homeless people. Lecrae Moore and volunteers with Love Beyond Walls assembled 15 wash stations, filled them with water and hand sanitizer and loaded them onto a truck for distribution. Lecrae, winner of the Best Gospel Album Grammy award in 2013 for his album “Gravity,” rolled up his sleeves and went to work early, his mind set on helping the less fortunate. “I wanted to continue doing the same stuff that I have been doing just in any city I’ve lived in and that’s just being close to the disenfranchised and the marginalized communities,” Lecrae said. Terence Lester, founder of Love Beyond Walls, told the AP that disenfranchised people on the streets are in need as the new coronavirus spreads. “You know, whether people like it or not, man we’re out here doing our part to ensure that people have access to this basic necessity during this pandemic,” Lester said. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.",Christian Artist Lecrae Donates Hand Washing Stations for Atlanta Homeless,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/03/20/christian-artist-lecrae-donates-hand-washing-stations-for-atlanta-homeless/,Breitbart
"NEW YORK (AP) — France’s Cannes Film Festival, arguably the world’s most prestigious film festival and cinema’s largest annual gathering, has postponed its 73rd edition due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the French Riviera festival, scheduled to take place May 12-23, said Thursday that they are considering moving the festival to the end of June or the beginning of July. “Several hypotheses are being studied to preserve the festival, the main one of which would be a simple postponement,” the festival said in a statement. “As soon as the development of the French and international health situation will allow us to assess the real possibility, we will make our decision known.” Organizers had been extremely reluctant to cancel Cannes. For weeks, its organizers deflected questions and tried to push through its selection process. But as the pandemic spread through France, it became all but inevitable that a massive gathering like Cannes would be canceled. On Saturday, France’s Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all restaurants, cafes and cinemas in France to increase social distancing and combat the virus. Other major film festivals, including South by Southwest and the Tribeca Film Festival, have already been scuttled. But some hope held out that Cannes, taking place closer to summer, might yet survive. Cannes has greater ramifications for the film industry, which annually convenes on the Cote d’Azur not just for the festival’s gala screenings but for the world’s largest movie market. Every year, countless production and distribution deals are hatched in Cannes. Film executives fly in from all over the world and gather at the Marche du Film in the basement of Cannes’ hub, the Palais. Every country with a film industry erects a pavilion at Cannes’ international village. The postponement is also especially painful for Cannes since it’s coming off a particularly successful 2019 edition. Though recent years have seen intensified criticism of the festival’s gender inclusivity and increased competition from other festivals like the Venice Film Festival, the 2019 Cannes featured the eventual Oscar best picture winner, Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” as well as Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” Pedro Almodovar’s acclaimed “Pain & Glory” and Celine Sciamma’s celebrated French drama “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” “Parasite” won Cannes’ Palme d’Or before its Oscar victory. But the international flavor of Cannes has worked against it this year. Because of the global spread of the novel coronavirus, even a virus-free France would have difficulty drawing — and keeping healthy — filmmakers, executives and press from around the world. Cannes, founded in 1939 while Europe was on the cusp of war, has been altered by tumult before. It began as an alternative to the Venice Film Festival, which then had become under the sway of Benito Mussolini. Its inaugural festival was canceled after its opening gala, the premiere of “The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” The next day, Germany invaded Poland. Cannes also came to a stop, famously, in 1968. Then, filmmakers including Jean Luc-Godard, François Truffaut, Louis Malle and Roman Polanski took to the stage of the Palais to declare the festival over in solidarity with the student and labor strike coursing through France. This time, Cannes hopes to stave off cancellation and return in the summer. The festival concluded its announcement: “A très bientôt” — “See you very soon.”","Cannes Film Festival Postponed, Potentially to June or July",2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/03/20/cannes-film-festival-postponed-potentially-to-june-or-july/,Breitbart
"The world must look to “miraculous” China for leadership in the growing coronavirus epidemic, a Pakistan political analyst said Thursday, adding criticism of the Communist state by the U.S. is “not conducive to global harmony.” “Rather than making mockery of the Chinese nation or calling the virus ‘made in China’, the world must learn from the miraculous measures China has adopted to defeat this invisible enemy,” said Yasir Masood, former director of media and publications at the Center of Excellence of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Massod’s voice is just one more in a global chorus cheering on China as it tries to paint itself as a Good Samaritan while at the same time deflecting criticism over its missteps in handling the coronavirus epidemic. The Pakistani political and international relations analyst told the official Xinhua News Agency any attempts to call China into question  over its handling of the Wuhan virus had to be condemned by the media, even as U.S. President Donald Trump tackled that very matter: Epidemics have taken millions of lives throughout history and can “wreak havoc at a moment’s notice,” Masoon reasoned, adding “epidemics and natural disasters have no boundaries and they do not announce their arrival.” China is now extending help to other countries to defeat this pandemic, he said, calling on Pakistan to take every step to follow China’s lead. Masood, who was in China when the disease first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, said the government’s efforts to stem the virus’ spread are commendable and must be applauded. “The sterilization of public places and collective quarantine were strictly adopted in the country and the suspected cases were taken care of,” he said. Praising the Chinese government and its people for their “resilience, discipline, and unity” during the outbreak, he said China’s measures must be followed and all blame laid to one side. Co-founder of Microsoft Corporation Bill Gates also pushed back against criticism of China, writing in an Ask Me Anything session on the American social news platform Reddit that “we should not call this the Chinese virus.” A front-page commentary by the state-run People’s Daily on Thursday emphasised China’s role as a “responsible major country” that willingly cooperates with other nations.",All Hail ‘Miraculous’ China: Pakistan Analyst Condemns U.S. Coronavirus Criticism,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/all-hail-miraculous-china-pakistan-analyst-condemns-u-s-coronavirus-criticism/,Breitbart
"The incidence of COVID-19 is dramatically lower in malarial countries than in non-malarial countries, according to one researcher. This may well vindicate President Donald Trump’s decision to fast-track the use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine phosphate for the treatment of coronavirus. The correlation was spotted by Dr Roy Spencer, meteorologist and a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Here is what he posted on his Facebook page:  There are various possible explanations for this ‘stunning’ correlation. One is that malarial countries are not keeping effective records and that the incidence of COVID-19 is much higher than they admit; another is that they are located in the tropics – and coronavirus does not survive for so long in hot countries. But the most encouraging possibility is that these are countries whose populations have been heavily exposed to the cheap, generic, old-fashioned anti-malarial drug chloroquine phosphate – and that this may have given them a degree of immunity. As I reported earlier, several studies – including a small scale one conducted in France this month – suggest that  chloroquine has proved effective in treating COVID-19. It has been previously used successfully in the treatment of SARS another coronavirus with similar characteristics to COVID-19. Anthony Watts at Watts Up With That? reports: Additional support for antimalarial drugs for COVID-19 treatment comes from this investigation linked below. The map says it all: COVID-19 is where Malaria is not.

"Dr. Nicole Saphier told Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that there was hope chloroquine and other drugs could treat coronavirus — but that people who did not need the medicines should stop hoarding them. Saphier, a former microbiologist, is a Fox News contributor and the author of Make America Healthy Again: How Bad Behavior and Big Government Caused a Trillion-Dollar Crisis. She spoke with host Alex Marlow about the latest developments in the fight against the pandemic. She explained that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two drugs the president discussed Thursday at the White House press briefing, are malaria drugs that incorporate themselves into viral RNA and stop a virus from replicating. They also stop inflammatory immune responses, which is why they are used in arthritis. In studies of the use of these drugs with coronavirus patients, Dr. Saphier noted, “the severity of their symptoms rapidly decreased.” Similar results were seen with the off-label use of remdesivir, a drug used against Ebola and other viruses. She noted that the sudden interest in the medicines, which had been subjected to panic buying, endangered those who depend on them for treating existing ailments. “We have to stop the hoarding and make sure we are helping those that need it,” she said. Dr. Saphier said that because most people will recover from coronavirus, the use of these drugs — especially as a prophylactic — should be reserved to those most at risk. Dr. Saphier criticized the media for reporting, falsely, that President Donald Trump had misled the public into thinking these medicines had been approved for COVID-19. What the president said was that the FDA had, in fact, approved the drugs for other uses but that they had shown some promise in treating coronavirus. “He was giving a glimmer of hope, and they just want to slam it down. And that is so unfortunate, and so upsetting,” she said. Dr. Saphier also criticized the media for claiming that the president was racist for calling coronavirus a “Chinese virus.” She noted that other diseases, such as Spanish flu, and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), are also named for their places of origin. “Come on, people — can we just stop? … Everyone needs to stop it.” Marlow noted several other virus named for places, such as Ebola, West Nile virus, and Lyme disease. Dr. Saphier applauded President Trump for a steadfast stance since the beginning of his administration in favor of making drug testing easier. “Unlike some politicians, who flip-flop in times of crisis, he has had a firm stance on this,” she said. She also applauded private manufacturing companies for switching production to ventilator machines, and to the U.S. Navy for mobilizing hospital ships. “Time will tell” if these measures were enough to step the effects of the pandemic, Dr. Saphier said.

"Manx police arrested a man who refused to self-isolate after landing on the Isle of Man in what is believed to be the first arrest in the British Isles for breaking coronavirus isolation laws. While the British House of Commons is currently passing emergency measures to allow police and other officials to detain those who have or are suspected of having coronavirus and who refuse quarantine, the Isle of Man, which lies between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, has already passed strict emergency measures that force all new arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms or where they travelled from. The self-governing British Crown Dependency, famous for motorcycle racing, passed the emergency measures on Tuesday. Those who refuse self-quarantine can be prosecuted and face three months in prison or a £10,000 fine. The 26-year-old unnamed British man is said to be held “in a specially cleaned” area at the island’s constabulary headquarters in Douglas which is “designated for those who should be self-isolating”, reports the BBC. He had arrived by boat on Thursday. A Manx police spokesman said: “We currently have one male in Police Custody for failing to adhere to the new legislation requiring him to self isolate. “Please follow the guidance issued by the Government and think about the safety of the community. This is an ever evolving situation and it is important we act in the best interests of keeping people safe.” In relation to the male arrested for breaching the self isolation rules. We will update on what happens to him later but while he is detained in will be in a specially cleaned area of custody designated for those who should be self isolating. pic.twitter.com/r8tLNY1KW0 — TweetbeatIOM (@TweetbeatIOM) March 20, 2020  The Isle of Man also recorded its first case of coronavirus on Thursday, with Manx Radio reporting that the person had recently returned from Spain, which is the fourth-hardest hit country in the world with 767 deaths and 17,147 confirmed cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle told the Manx parliament, the Tynwald: “We are entering an unprecedented period in the Island’s history which requires the Government to mitigate a serious threat to the health of our population. “We cannot allow our critical health services to become overwhelmed and must have the means to prosecute those who choose to act irresponsibly.” “Protecting the vulnerable in our community is our highest priority and invoking emergency powers will enable us to do so swiftly, as well as acting as a deterrent,” Mr Quayle added. While British police have enhanced powers to detain as a result of the emergency coronavirus bill, so far the government is only strongly advising social distancing and Britain’s external borders remain open with no requirement for new arrivals to self-isolate. The EU, however, is under lockdown and France has warned the UK that unless it shuts its borders and enacts stricter measures, it may decide to bar Britons — who are currently exempt from restrictions — from entering.

"A poll released Friday shows President Donald Trump’s approval for his handling of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak is on the rise. In the figures reported by ABC, a full 55 percent of Americans approve of the president’s management of the crisis, against 43 percent who disapprove. Trump’s approval on this issue is up from last week, when the numbers were nearly reversed. Only 43 percent approved of Trump’s handling of the pandemic and 54 percent disapproved in last week’s poll. The poll conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News, using Ipsos’ Knowledge Panel, asked Americans about the disruption to their daily lives amid more urgent efforts to contain the spread of the global pandemic, Trump’s response, and their concerns over contracting the virus. Critically, as more people express concern for the viral disease, so too do more people approve of the work the Trump administration is undertaking to handle the crisis in public health. Anxiety over the coronavirus is widespread, according to the poll, with 79 percent of Americans saying they are concerned that they or someone they know will be infected, which is a significant uptick from last week when 66 percent said the same. Among Democrats, 87 percent are concerned about getting coronavirus, including 37 percent who are very concerned. Republicans remain the least concerned among the ideological groups, with 66 percent saying they are concerned, including 23 percent who are very concerned. Only 12 percent of Democrats and 34 percent of Republicans are not concerned. Overall attitudes towards Trump’s handling of the crisis also strongly breaks along partisan party lines. In a split from Democrats’ overall attitudes, even from last week, 30 percent of Democrats approve, which is about double the number from last week’s poll, and 69 percent disapprove, down from 86 percent. Meanwhile, an overwhelming 92 percent of Republicans approve, up from 86 percent last week. Only 8 percent disapprove, compared to 11 percent in last week’s poll.

"CLAIM: Left-wing media are claiming a National Institutes of Health (NIH) immunologist cannot find cures for the infection caused by the coronavirus without the body parts of aborted babies. VERDICT: FALSE The Washington Post and Vox are two left-wing media outlets that published stories this week claiming that a Montana-based NIH scientist is appealing to the Trump administration to end its ban on federal funds for research that uses fetal tissue from the body parts of aborted babies so he can develop a treatment for the infection caused by the coronavirus. According to the reports, NIH immunologist Dr. Kim Hasenkrug claims he has been unable to conduct experiments on possible cures for the infection because he cannot obtain aborted fetal tissue. WaPo stated: According to several researchers familiar with the situation, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive internal dispute, such experiments could be particularly fruitful. Just months ago, before the new coronavirus began to infect people around the world, other U.S. scientists made two highly relevant discoveries. They found that specialized mice could be transplanted with human fetal tissue that develops into lungs — the part of the body the new coronavirus invades. These “humanized mice,” they also found, could then be infected with coronaviruses — to which ordinary mice are not susceptible — closely related to the one that causes the new disease, covid-19. However, the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said the claim is coming from those who are “shamelessly exploiting the coronavirus pandemic, playing on people’s fears at a vulnerable time so that a select few can continue to use aborted fetal tissue in their research.” CLI continued: The fact is there are modern, successful alternatives available. Already, over 60 potential treatments are under investigation – none of which need aborted fetal tissue to fight coronavirus. Instead of wasting precious time listening to these dishonest claims, we should continue to focus our attention on successful, ethical alternatives that don’t require the exploitation of baby body parts, taxpayer dollars, and public sentiment that just wants a swift and compassionate end to this crisis. In fact, on Thursday, President Donald Trump said his administration would make the malaria drug chloroquine available “almost immediately” to treat the infection caused by the coronavirus. Studies are showing chloroquine can both prevent and treat coronavirus in the cells of primates, but it is not yet FDA-approved for COVID-19. The FDA will make the drug available under the “compassionate use” program until it undergoes a clinical trial. In December 2018 CLI’s vice president and research director, Dr. David Prentice, and senior fellow in life sciences, Dr. Tara Sander Lee, testified before Congress regarding the array of ethical alternatives to experiments using aborted baby parts. Tony Perkins, Family Research Council president, who supports the Trump administration’s ban on fetal tissue use, observed in June 2019, “The fact is aborted fetal tissue hasn’t been used to create the cure of a single disease.” He added: However, tax dollars have been contributing to an industry that fosters the trafficking of body parts from aborted babies. There is absolutely no reason to use these grisly remains when ethical and effective alternatives exist including human umbilical cord blood stem cells and adult peripheral blood stem cells. Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) also praised the Trump administration for ending the practice of using aborted fetal tissue for research: The Trump Administration has taken this important step toward stopping the barbaric practice of using the body parts of aborted babies for research. Not only is the practice unethical, it is ineffective: fetal tissue, including fetal organs like liver and thymus, have not produced a single clinical treatment. Several weeks ago, Judicial Watch announced it had obtained “676 pages of records from the NIH that showed the health agency “paid thousands of dollars to a California-based firm to purchase organs from aborted human fetuses to create ‘humanized mice’ for HIV research.” The government watchdog organization continued: The records show that NIH paid at least $18,100 between December 2016 and August 2018 to Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) for livers and thymuses from second trimester aborted fetuses. They include at least 26 such purchases from ABR by Dr. Kim Hasenkrug, senior investigator at the NIH lab in Hamilton, Montana. Purchase orders associated with the transactions state: “These tissues, liver and thymus, are required [by] Ron Messer for ongoing studies of HIV in the Hasenkrug Lab. Our mice will be ready for reconstitution soon.” Breitbart News reached out to Hasenkrug for comment but received no immediate response. In fact, in September 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ended a contract between ABR and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after reports of the biomedical company providing the government with “fresh” aborted baby tissue to engineer humanized mice for drug experimentation. The contract was ended following several years of congressional investigation into the abortion industry’s alleged complicit relationship with biomedical companies, including ABR, that purchased the body parts of aborted babies. In December 2016, former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley wrote in a letter to Obama-era Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former FBI Director James Comey that he was referring “the paid fetal tissue practices of the following organizations … to the FBI and the Department of Justice for investigation and potential prosecution” and named ABR as one of the organizations. “I don’t take lightly making a criminal referral,” Grassley said in a statement at the time: But, the seeming disregard for the law by these entities has been fueled by decades of utter failure by the Justice Department to enforce it. And, unless there is a renewed commitment by everyone involved against commercializing the trade in aborted fetal body parts for profit, then the problem is likely to continue. In a statement sent to Breitbart News on Thursday, Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for Students for Life of America, said, “Scientists have testified that using the bodies of aborted babies for research is inhumane and not medically necessary.” “And people understand that we can’t abuse the weak for research,” she explained. “It’s pathetic opportunism to try and use the broken bodies of the preborn for human experiments when there are other options.”",Fact Check: Left-Wing Media Claim Aborted Baby Parts Needed to Cure Coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/fact-check-left-wing-media-claim-aborted-baby-parts-needed-cure-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"(AP) — They may only play doctors on TV, but they’re giving real-life help to hospitals that have taken a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. The Fox TV medical series “The Resident” has donated some of its on-set masks and gowns to a hospital in Atlanta, where it shoots, and the ABC show “The Good Doctor” is moving to do the same in its home base of Vancouver, Canada. “To the entire team @theresidentonfox, thank you for this incredibly generous donation of #PPE from your set, including gowns, masks, gloves, and all the things our healthcare workers need to provide safe care for our community during #COVID19,” Dr. Karen Law of Grady Memorial Hospital said on Instagram, along with a photo of boxes of the donated gear. Show representatives confirmed that the gear came from them, and representatives of “The Good Doctor” said they were in talks with government officials in Vancouver about what is needed at hospitals there. “I had a serious discussion with the residents about how, though supplies are low, a magical shipment of masks is unlikely to arrive,” Law said. “And yet, a magical shipment of masks DID arrive, in the form of this very generous gesture.” The coronavirus has especially hit home for “The Good Doctor.” Actor Daniel Dae Kim, who is a producer on the show and appeared in several episodes last year, says he has tested positive for it. Kim said in an Instagram video from his house in Hawaii that while flying home from a shoot in New York — where he was playing a doctor helping with a flu pandemic — he noticed an itch in his throat, followed by a tightness in his chest and body aches that prompted him to get tested. Kim says he was not hospitalized, and began feeling better within a few days. “I’m not 100 percent, but I’m close,” he said.","Coronavirus: ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ Medical TV Shows Donate Hospital Equipment to First Responders",2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/03/20/coronavirus-greys-anatomy-medical-tv-shows-donate-hospital-equipment-to-first-responders/,Breitbart
"As lawmakers are considering a coronavirus relief bill, Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) on Friday stressed the importance of providing immediate relief to American families amid the coronavirus pandemic. Barrasso described the “Phase 3” COVID-19 bill a “rescue operation for our country,” calling for “all hands on deck” from both Republican and Democratic senators. “This is a rescue operation for our country,” Barrasso told “Fox & Friends.” “We need immediate relief for people all across America. To me, that’s direct support as well as dealing with the medical component of this. I think we need all hands on deck, the more senators involved in discussing it the better. We have a number of task forces who are working on it. We are working straight through the weekend.

"Several medical and advocacy groups have insisted abortion services should be considered as essential health care during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and not subject to delays or a reduction of availability that will affect other health services. Noting that some health systems “are implementing plans to cancel elective and non-urgent procedures to expand hospitals’ capacity to provide critical care” to victims of the crisis, a joint statement by several health organizations has urged that abortion providers should be exempt from such cutbacks. A “Joint Statement on Abortion Access During the COVID-19 Outbreak” was issued Wednesday by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology, together with the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists, the American Gynecological & Obstetrical Society, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society of Family Planning, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. “While most abortion care is delivered in outpatient settings, in some cases care may be delivered in hospital-based settings or surgical facilities. To the extent that hospital systems or ambulatory surgical facilities are categorizing procedures that can be delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, abortion should not be categorized as such a procedure,” the statement declares. “Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care,” the statement insists. “It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible.” The statement echoes a similar appeal by the National Abortion Federation (NAF), which “calls on leaders to ensure that outpatient abortion clinics can remain open and urges hospitals to continue to provide abortion care” even while other medical services are reduced or suspended. According to the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), a surgery “may be deemed urgent and necessary if the treating physician decides that a months-long delay would increase the likelihood of significantly worse morbidity or prognosis for the patient.” In Wednesday’s joint statement, the group of signatories declare that they “do not support COVID-19 responses that cancel or delay abortion procedures,” while adding that community-based and hospital-based clinicians “should consider collaboration to ensure abortion access is not compromised during this time.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome",Lobby Insists Abortions Must Continue Unabated During Coronavirus Crisis,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/20/lobby-insists-abortions-must-continue-unabated-during-coronavirus-crisis/,Breitbart
"Dr. Nicole Saphier told Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that there was hope chloroquine and other drugs could treat coronavirus — but that people who did not need the medicines should stop hoarding them. Saphier, a former microbiologist, is a Fox News contributor and the author of Make America Healthy Again: How Bad Behavior and Big Government Caused a Trillion-Dollar Crisis. She spoke with host Alex Marlow about the latest developments in the fight against the pandemic. She explained that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two drugs the president discussed Thursday at the White House press briefing, are malaria drugs that incorporate themselves into viral RNA and stop a virus from replicating. They also stop inflammatory immune responses, which is why they are used in arthritis. In studies of the use of these drugs with coronavirus patients, Dr. Saphier noted, “the severity of their symptoms rapidly decreased.” Similar results were seen with the off-label use of remdesivir, a drug used against Ebola and other viruses. She noted that the sudden interest in the medicines, which had been subjected to panic buying, endangered those who depend on them for treating existing ailments. “We have to stop the hoarding and make sure we are helping those that need it,” she said. Dr. Saphier said that because most people will recover from coronavirus, the use of these drugs — especially as a prophylactic — should be reserved to those most at risk. Dr. Saphier criticized the media for reporting, falsely, that President Donald Trump had misled the public into thinking these medicines had been approved for COVID-19. What the president said was that the FDA had, in fact, approved the drugs for other uses but that they had shown some promise in treating coronavirus. “He was giving a glimmer of hope, and they just want to slam it down. And that is so unfortunate, and so upsetting,” she said. Dr. Saphier also criticized the media for claiming that the president was racist for calling coronavirus a “Chinese virus.” She noted that other diseases, such as Spanish flu, and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), are also named for their places of origin. “Come on, people — can we just stop? … Everyone needs to stop it.” Marlow noted several other virus named for places, such as Ebola, West Nile virus, and Lyme disease. Dr. Saphier applauded President Trump for a steadfast stance since the beginning of his administration in favor of making drug testing easier. “Unlike some politicians, who flip-flop in times of crisis, he has had a firm stance on this,” she said. She also applauded private manufacturing companies for switching production to ventilator machines, and to the U.S. Navy for mobilizing hospital ships. “Time will tell” if these measures were enough to step the effects of the pandemic, Dr. Saphier said.

"Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is chiding President Donald Trump for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak while giving a day-to-day running commentary on his job performance.

In other words, I think you all know what it is, and it can do a lot of good things if we need it,” Trump said. “And we will — we will have it all completed, signing it in just a little while.” “Right after I’m finished with this conference, I’ll be signing it,” Trump said. “It’s prepared to go. “So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act.” “The Defense Production Act of 1950 was signed by President Harry S.

"A report has claimed that Lewisham and Greenwich has become the first London National Health Service (NHS) trust to turn away coronavirus patients, sending them on to other hospitals as they struggle to keep up with incoming cases. A senior clinician at the southern London trust told The Telegraph that due to a surge in demand they have had to transfer coronavirus patients to other hospitals, saying that on Tuesday of five patients in need of intensive care, just one could be admitted. The medic said: “We’re running out of beds and running out of space. Some patients with Covid-19 are being shipped to other trusts.” “Very, very difficult choices are having to be made,” he said. “Sometimes five new people are being intubated every 12 hours, but not all Covid patients are getting access.” The trust disputed that any patient needing breathing support had been denied access, telling the newspaper that all those who have needed ventilation have received it. The source added that the emergency rooms at the two hospitals being managed by the trust had begun to resemble “Covid-19 waiting rooms”, a phrase evoking images of overwhelmed Italian hospitals where patients are being treated in waiting areas. Government experts say that the United Kingdom is currently three weeks behind Italy; Sky News reported from a hospital in Bergamo that doctors are warning Britons that Italian crisis levels are heading Britain’s way. Lewisham and Greenwich is not the only London NHS trust facing difficulty, with a source from another London hospital trust telling the newspapers that they only had seven days’ worth of protective equipment. London is the outbreak hotspot in the country, with latest figures tallying 1,221 confirmed cases and 56 deaths. “We weren’t prepared for the coronavirus,” said Dr Marcello Natali. “As doctors of the post antibiotic era, we grew up thinking that a pill against everything was enough.”https://t.co/DSelh5HvcY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  A government source told The Telegraph: “In London, the situation is already looking like one of the worst winters we could remember — elderly people needing ventilators and just not enough of them to go round. We were already under pressure, the situation is deteriorating pretty fast.” Despite the government advising social distancing, avoiding public venues like pubs, and working from home where you can, there is growing concern over people in London failing to heed the advice, which fueled speculation earlier in the week that the government was going to enforce a lockdown in the capital. The Johnson administration later said there was “zero prospect” of the public’s movement around London being suppressed. “There are no plans to close down the transport network in London and there is zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of London,” a government spokesman said. However, support for a London lockdown has come from the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who told the London Assembly in comments reported by The Times: “I am concerned about people not following the advice. There are still too many people being witnessed on our streets, in our bars, in our cafés, using the Tube, using our buses.” The Labour politician said “the advice from the government is just advice, and I think that provides a mixed message. We may move to a situation where we move from advice to bans.” “…our liberties and human rights need to be changed, curtailed, infringed — use whatever word you want” in order to stop the deadly virus from spreading, Mr Khan said. Deaths in Italy have surpassed those officially recorded in China, with Europe now being the epicentre of the pandemic.

Because outside of China, where it originated, the countries in the world that have it are through travel, either directly from China or indirectly from someone who went someplace and then came to that particular country,” Fauci told Lester Holt. “Our shutting off travel from China and, more recently, travel from Europe, has gone a long way to not seeding very, very intensively the virus in our country.

"Restrictions and closures hurting truckers will exacerbate shortages and rising prices of basic goods, warned Mark Willis, host of SiriusXM’s Road Dog News, in an interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on Friday. Willis warned of how shortsighted restrictions and closures of roads, rest areas, and businesses in responses to the viral spread make it more difficult for truckers to secure basic goods and services while working. “Truckers aren’t feeling the love,” said Willis on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily, despite a campaign of messages on social media tagged with #ThankATrucker. Willis said, “The closure of some state-operated rest areas, [a] sudden lack of places to buy food, and also the refusal of a lot of businesses to let drivers use the bathroom, are making it really tough for a lot of drivers to deliver essential goods and medical supplies.” LISTEN:
 Willis continued, “It’s hitting truck drivers at all levels of the supply chain, and what we’ve got are some uneven local reactions across the United States to the spread of the coronavirus. It’s threatening to cramp down on truck capacity and push up rates and prices.” “Drivers [are] spending extra time looking for food or bathrooms,” warning that small and remote drive-throughs, restaurants, and other small businesses “are coming under a lot of pressure to close or curtail services as freight demand [is] driven up by consumer spending on essential goods is really rising rapidly.” Many truckers are unsure how they will get the basic services they need in order to operate on the road, warned Willis. Willis highlighted Pennsylvania’s closure of rest areas — mandated by the state’s transportation department — as illustrative of poorly implemented policy to address the coronavirus threat. Trucker organizations and associations are advocating for a relaxing of harmful policies, Willis said, “to keep that essential flow of commerce moving [which is] vital for the economy in these trying times.” Marlow asked what DC-based policymakers should do during the disease’s spread regarding truckers. Willis urged politicians and authorities to listen to truckers and truckers’ interest groups. “Oftentimes many of the trucking industry feel that they don’t have a voice in any of the policy decisions that are coming down from inside of the beltway,” he added. “Ultimately, every decision that impacts the transportation or the trucking industry winds up right in the front seat of the of the person driving that cab,” advised Willis. “So listen to the constituents, [and] be flexible in the whole idea of new initiatives that will make the job a whole lot easier, make it safer for the traveling public [and] for the trucking industry.” Willis noted the centrality of trucking to America’s economy. “These guys and ladies driving these trucks they are the backbone of America,” concluded Willis, “and if we don’t provide them the adequate services that they need in order to get the job done, we’re gonna Have some real trouble out there.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

"An NBC News employee has died from the Chinese coronavirus, according to a company memo published by the Daily Beast on Friday morning. NBC Chairman Andy Lack told staffers that audio technician Larry Edgeworth is the first staffer to pass away from the illness, calling him “longtime member of our NBC News family.” According to Lack, Edgeworth had “suffered from other health issues that led him to succumb to the illness.” “Many of you were fortunate enough to work with Larry over the years, so you know that he was the guy you wanted by your side no matter where you were,” wrote Lack. “Stacy Brady says he was known as the ‘gentle giant who would give you the shirt off his back.’” Edgeworth’s passing comes as some of NBC’s biggest stars, such as Savannah Guthrie, Al Roker, and Craig Melvin, have been working from home after a Today show staffer working at its headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza contracted the illness.

"As lawmakers are considering a coronavirus relief bill, Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) on Friday stressed the importance of providing immediate relief to American families amid the coronavirus pandemic. Barrasso described the “Phase 3” COVID-19 bill a “rescue operation for our country,” calling for “all hands on deck” from both Republican and Democratic senators. “This is a rescue operation for our country,” Barrasso told “Fox & Friends.” “We need immediate relief for people all across America. To me, that’s direct support as well as dealing with the medical component of this. I think we need all hands on deck, the more senators involved in discussing it the better. We have a number of task forces who are working on it. We are working straight through the weekend. We need to go big, we need to be bold on this, and it needs to be bipartisan, Brian.” He continued, “We have two crises right now: We have the health care crisis and the economic crisis. And until we get this medical crisis behind us, we’re not going to be able to do what we need to do to recover our economy.” Barrasso also emphasized how employees are out of work and how businesses have had to shut down amid the outbreak. “They need immediate relief and direct support now,” he added.

"Dr. Nicole Saphier told Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that there was hope chloroquine and other drugs could treat coronavirus — but that people who did not need the medicines should stop hoarding them. Saphier, a former microbiologist, is a Fox News contributor and the author of Make America Healthy Again: How Bad Behavior and Big Government Caused a Trillion-Dollar Crisis. She spoke with host Alex Marlow about the latest developments in the fight against the pandemic. She explained that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two drugs the president discussed Thursday at the White House press briefing, are malaria drugs that incorporate themselves into viral RNA and stop a virus from replicating. They also stop inflammatory immune responses, which is why they are used in arthritis.  In studies of the use of these drugs with coronavirus patients, Dr. Saphier noted, “the severity of their symptoms rapidly decreased.” Similar results were seen with the off-label use of remdesivir, a drug used against Ebola and other viruses. She noted that the sudden interest in the medicines, which had been subjected to panic buying, endangered those who depend on them for treating existing ailments. “We have to stop the hoarding and make sure we are helping those that need it,” she said. Dr. Saphier said that because most people will recover from coronavirus, the use of these drugs — especially as a prophylactic — should be reserved to those most at risk. Dr. Saphier criticized the media for reporting, falsely, that President Donald Trump had misled the public into thinking these medicines had been approved for COVID-19. What the president said was that the FDA had, in fact, approved the drugs for other uses but that they had shown some promise in treating coronavirus. “He was giving a glimmer of hope, and they just want to slam it down. And that is so unfortunate, and so upsetting,” she said. Dr. Saphier also criticized the media for claiming that the president was racist for calling coronavirus a “Chinese virus.” She noted that other diseases, such as Spanish flu, and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), are also named for their places of origin. “Come on, people — can we just stop? … Everyone needs to stop it.” Marlow noted several other virus named for places, such as Ebola, West Nile virus, and Lyme disease. Dr. Saphier applauded President Trump for a steadfast stance since the beginning of his administration in favor of making drug testing easier. “Unlike some politicians, who flip-flop in times of crisis, he has had a firm stance on this,” she said. She also applauded private manufacturing companies for switching production to ventilator machines, and to the U.S. Navy for mobilizing hospital ships. “Time will tell” if these measures were enough to step the effects of the pandemic, Dr. Saphier said.

"A poll released Friday shows President Donald Trump’s approval for his handling of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak is on the rise. In the figures reported by ABC, a full 55 percent of Americans approve of the president’s management of the crisis, against 43 percent who disapprove. Trump’s approval on this issue is up from last week, when the numbers were nearly reversed. Only 43 percent approved of Trump’s handling of the pandemic and 54 percent disapproved in last week’s poll. The poll conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News, using Ipsos’ Knowledge Panel, asked Americans about the disruption to their daily lives amid more urgent efforts to contain the spread of the global pandemic, Trump’s response, and their concerns over contracting the virus. Critically, as more people express concern for the viral disease, so too do more people approve of the work the Trump administration is undertaking to handle the crisis in public health. Anxiety over the coronavirus is widespread, according to the poll, with 79 percent of Americans saying they are concerned that they or someone they know will be infected, which is a significant uptick from last week when 66 percent said the same. Among Democrats, 87 percent are concerned about getting coronavirus, including 37 percent who are very concerned. Republicans remain the least concerned among the ideological groups, with 66 percent saying they are concerned, including 23 percent who are very concerned. Only 12 percent of Democrats and 34 percent of Republicans are not concerned. Overall attitudes towards Trump’s handling of the crisis also strongly breaks along partisan party lines. In a split from Democrats’ overall attitudes, even from last week, 30 percent of Democrats approve, which is about double the number from last week’s poll, and 69 percent disapprove, down from 86 percent. Meanwhile, an overwhelming 92 percent of Republicans approve, up from 86 percent last week. Only 8 percent disapprove, compared to 11 percent in last week’s poll.

"Former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg (D) is transferring $18 million in campaign funds to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as part of the greater effort to bolster Joe Biden (D) in the general election and ultimately defeat President Trump. The former New York City mayor, who wasted $600 million on his failed efforts to rise to the top of the Democrat field and become the party’s nominee, is reportedly transferring $18 million to the DNC. While Bloomberg previously pledged to continue his efforts to defeat Trump even if he did not win the nomination, he initially indicated that he would do so separately — not necessarily shoulder to shoulder with the DNC. However, his campaign told DNC chairman Tom Perez that it now believes they will be most effective if they combine their efforts. Bloomberg’s campaign memo to Perez reads: While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the president accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution. We therefore believe the best thing we can all do over the next eight months is to help the group that matters most in this fight: the Democratic National Committee. “Our country is in crisis, and a change in presidential leadership is more important now than ever to protect our families, our communities and our economy,” Perez said in a statement. “With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump,” he added. Bloomberg’s donation will support the DNC’s “Battleground Build-Up 2020” program across key battleground states as Democrats move to beef up their organizing efforts. According to Bloomberg’s outlet, the former presidential hopeful is “transferring leases from several campaign offices to state Democratic parties,” and a “list of ‘hundreds’ of staff members will be given to the DNC with the expectation and hope they would be hired, a campaign aide said.” Bloomberg endorsed Biden following his departure from the race, telling his supporters that he knows the former vice president’s “decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country – including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs.”",Mike Bloomberg Transferring $18 Million in Campaign Funds to DNC to Defeat Donald Trump,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/mike-bloomberg-transferring-18-million-campaign-funds-dnc-defeat-donald-trump/,Breitbart
"Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) urged the federal government on Friday to tap into the unused Presidential Election Campaign Fund to provide healthcare equipment to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Ernst called for the federal government to tap into the resource, which has more than $357 million in unused funds sitting idle, to be used to purchase masks and other protective equipment for healthcare providers, first responders, and others to protect against the coronavirus. The Iowa conservative’s proposal would redirect from the presidential campaign fund to the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Strategic National Stockpile, which stores and distributes supplies for emergency situations. Ernst, a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, said in a statement on Friday: As I’ve said, it’s going to take an all hands on deck approach to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. I’ve heard directly from Iowa state officials and our health care providers about the need for additional masks and personal protective equipment. Right now, there’s more than $350 million in unused cash sitting around in the obsolete and outdated presidential election campaign fund. This is simple. We should immediately move that money to where it’s critically needed: let’s put it toward more masks and personal protective equipment for the health care workers who are on the front lines of this pandemic. Ernst’s announcement came as she spoke to Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, and other health providers, about the shortage of specialized masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Ernst’s proposal would also eliminate the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, which she has called to do in her Eliminating Leftover Expenses for Campaigns from Taxpayers (ELECT) Act of 2020. “I’ve heard directly from Iowa officials & health care providers: we need masks & personal protective equipment now. We don’t need the presidential election campaign fund. My bill redirects money to where it’s critically needed,” Ernst wrote on Friday.

"Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of President Donald Trump, returned Friday to her role as White House senior adviser after testing negative for the Chinese coronavirus. “Over the last week, Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump has followed social distancing best practices at her home,” a White House official said in a statement. “At the advisement of her doctors, due to lack of symptoms and consistently healthy physician checks, Advisor Trump will be working from the White House today.” “As is done with every employee at the White House, she will undergo the same health/temperature checks to maintain the safety of herself, her children and those in the White House,” added the official.

President Donald Trump has also tested negative for the coronavirus. The president underwent testing after dining at Mar-a-Lago with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, who tested positive for the illness. Bolsonaro tested negative for the disease last Friday. Meanwhile, the White House has begun conducting temperature checks for reporters “in close contact” with President Trump or Vice President Pence. “Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

"Americans are expressing outrage at reports that several members of the Senate, both Republican and Democrat, sold stocks shortly after being briefed about the coronavirus threat in January. At the time, President Donald Trump was assembling a task force, and mulling a travel ban — while Democrats were preoccupied with impeachment. But some quietly cashed out, as well. Breitbart News anticipated this problem almost a decade ago, with the publication of senior contributor Peter Schweizer’s book, Throw Them All Out: How Politicians and Their Friends Get Rich Off Insider Stock Tips, Land Deals, and Cronyism That Would Send the Rest of Us to Prison. In it, Schweizer described how members of Congress from both parties had sold stock in 2008 after receiving closed-door briefings on the imminent financial crisis — among other examples. The late Andrew Breitbart championed the cause of reform. And to the company’s surprise — and the country’s shock — President Barack Obama took up the idea in his State of the Union address in 2012: I’ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad — and it seems to get worse every year. Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let’s take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow. (Applause.) Let’s limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let’s make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can’t lobby Congress, and vice versa — an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington. In April 2012, President Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which had passed overwhelmingly in both houses of Congress. He added: “The STOCK Act makes it clear that if members of Congress use nonpublic information to gain an unfair advantage in the market, then they are breaking the law.” Joel B.

"New York Gov.

We’re all in various levels of quarantine and it’s hard.”  The move comes as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly asked Cuomo to invoke a shelter-in-place order for his city — a request the governor has denied. “It is not a shelter in place order,” Cuomo clarified of his order. “Shelter in place is used currently for an active shooter or a school shooter.” As of Thursday, New York City has confirmed 3,954 coronavirus cases and 26 deaths. “We’re seeing an explosion of cases here in New York City,” De Blasio said at a press conference Thursday. “This number is, nonetheless, very, very painful.” New York City is expected to receive $1.38 billion in federal funding to help ease the financial strain caused by the virus, but De Blasio has said the aid is not enough. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), citing a massive drop in riders, has is asking for a $4 billion bailout from the federal government. “It’s hugely important but it’s only the beginning,” said the mayor. “Right now, we have immense expenses that we’re having to address with declining revenue.

"President Trump’s administration is halting all non-essential travel at the United States’ southern border with Mexico and northern border with Canada beginning Saturday, March 21. During a press conference on Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Chad Wolf announced that the U.S. would be closing off its southern and northern borders for all non-essential travel to stop the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Non-essential travel at the southern and northern border includes tourism and recreational travel. “We’ve reached an agreement with both Canada and Mexico to limit non-essential travel across our land borders,” Wolf said. “Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce. Essential commercial activities will not be impacted.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) order means the U.S. will suspend entry at its land borders to foreign nationals who have no proper travel documentation, cannot verify their identity, or have no medical documentation. These foreign nationals will be immediately returned to Canada, Mexico, or another country from which they arrived. Wolf said DHS has been apprehending foreign nationals from more than 120 countries, the overwhelming majority of which have confirmed coronavirus cases. “Many of these individuals arrive with little or no identity, travel, or medical documentation — making public health risks determinations all but impossible,” Wolf said. “The outbreak on our southern border would likely increase the strain on health systems in our border communities, taking away life-saving resources from American citizens.” Pompeo said the State Department has issued a Level 4 global travel advisory for U.S. citizens, requesting that all Americans not travel internationally at this time. U.S. citizens abroad, Pompeo said, should return home immediately unless they plan to stay abroad for an extended period of time. As Breitbart News reported, nearly 151,000 border crossers and illegal aliens have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border since October 2019 from 72 affected countries. Since then, 1,657 Chinese nationals have been apprehended at the southern border. About 341 of these Chinese nationals sought to enter the U.S. illegally just within the last few months. At the U.S.-Canada border, nearly 10,400 foreign nationals were deemed inadmissible or apprehended in January and February. Likewise, about 6.3 million noncitizens were legally admitted to the U.S. from the northern border since January 1, before Canada’s global travel ban was implemented.

"President Donald Trump announced at the White House Friday that the government would suspend and waive all interest on federally held student loans for 60 days as the nation continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic. “I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately,” Trump said, promising to extend the waivers longer than 60 days if needed. “Borrowers should contact their lenders,” Trump said, adding that it was “going to make a lot of students happy.” The news was detailed in a statement from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

The Department of Education will also grant a waiver to any state who requests a bypass of federally mandated testing requirements for the 2019-2020 year. “They’ve been through a lot … a lot of students will be extremely happy,” Trump said after announcing the testing waiver. “Some probably not, the ones that work hard maybe not, but it’s one of those things, very unfortunate circumstance.” “Neither students nor teachers need to be focused on high-stakes tests during this difficult time,” DeVos said in a statement.",Donald Trump Suspends Payments and Waives Interest on Federally Owned Student Loans for 60 Days,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/donald-trump-suspends-payments-waives-interest-federally-owned-student-loans-60-days/,Breitbart
"Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) is urging the Senate Ethics Committee to probe his decision to unload upwards of $1.72 million in stock before the coronavirus pandemic reached its height in February. Burr, who serves as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, released a statement on Friday defending his conduct amid calls for his resignation from across the political aisle. In making his defense, the senator claimed he was not acting on any inside information when choosing to unload his investments. Burr did, however, admit that the pandemic was his prime motivator for the selloff—contrasting public statements he made at the time. “I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13,” Burr said in the statement. “Specifically, I closely followed CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time.” “Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” the senator added. My statement in response to reports about recent financial disclosures: pic.twitter.com/J4kye5a4ok — Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 20, 2020  Burr’s call for an Ethics Committee investigation comes less than one day after it was revealed he dumped thousands of dollars of stock—less than a week before the stock market sharply dropped because of the pandemic. The senator’s timely sell off netted between $628,000 and $1.72 million. Most of the shares were in companies, like Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Hilton, that took an especially hard hit as coronavirus travel restrictions went into place. More troubling for Burr is that transactions, 33 in total, came as the Intelligence Committee was receiving daily briefings on the pandemic. Given that fact, when news of the selloff broke, speculation began to stir that the senator had acted on inside information to protect his assets. If true, Burr could potentially be found in violation of the STOCK Act, which prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit by lawmakers. Even before such a determination could be made, though, calls began to mount for Burr’s resignation from both the left and right. Fox News host Tucker Carlson summed up the feelings of many Thursday evening when delivering a blistering critic of the senator’s conduct. Carlson, in particular, suggested that even if Burr’s actions did not rise to the level of insider trading, they were still problematic as the senator had penned an op-ed only days before the selloff urging citizens to have faith in their government’s preparedness to combat the virus. “He didn’t warn the public. … He didn’t even disavow an op-ed he’d written just ten days before claiming America was ‘better prepared than ever for coronavirus,’” the Fox News host said. “Instead … he dumped his shares in hotel stocks so he wouldn’t lose money, and then he stayed silent.” “Maybe there is an honest explanation for what he did. If there is, he should share it with the rest of us immediately,” Carlson added. “Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate and face prosecution for insider trading.” Others, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), echoed a similar sentiment about Burr’s conduct when calling for his resignation. “Burr knew how bad it would be. He told the truth to his wealthy donors, while assuring the public that we were fine,” the congresswoman said on Twitter, noting a recent report by NPR that Burr had warned North Carolina business leaders about the burgeoning pandemic in late-February during a closed-door meeting. “He needs to resign.”",Richard Burr Urges Ethics Probe as Criticism Grows over Coronavirus Stock Dump,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/richard-burr-urges-ethics-probe-as-criticism-grows-over-coronavirus-stock-dump/,Breitbart

"A mere eight days ago, Joe Biden was still vocally opposing President Donald Trump’s travel bans from Europe, and even China, as racist. In other words, if Biden was the president, we can’t begin to imagine how much worse things would look in American today thanks to President Biden’s refusal to keep people out from the very same places where the Chinese coronavirus rages. Below is the timeline in China Joe’s own words. Afterwards, we will do some math and hear from Dr. Fauci. All the way back on January 31, in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak in China, President Trump announced a travel ban of “all foreign nationals who have traveled in China within the last 14 days.” That included, obviously, Chinese citizens and anyone from any country who visited China. Americans returning from China were put under a 14-day quarantine. That was 50 days ago. President Trump took that action 50 whole days ago. That same day, Joe Biden published this tweet: [N]ow [Trump’s] adding more countries to his list of who’s not welcome in America. It’s not who we are — and we’ll prove that when we beat Trump this November and end the ban. Please note that Biden promised to “end the ban” — the ban that stops people from entering our country who are coming in from a country facing a massive epidemic. The next day, Biden — who has always been cozy with China, and whose son Hunter set up a deal worth hundreds of millions with the Chinese government while traveling with his father (who was then vice president) — issued the following statement declaring Trump’s ban “racist” and “xenophobic.” Yesterday, Donald Trump further diminished the United States in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban, placing new restrictions on the residents of six more nations that limit who is allowed to come to the United States. … Trump’s atrocious asylum and refugee policies — they are all designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s that simple. They are racist. They are xenophobic. And there is no evidence that they do anything to make us safer. Immigrants from each of these countries and their broader diaspora communities here in the United States enrich the larger fabric of American life as our friends and neighbors and make vital contributions to our economy. That same day, Biden published this tweet: We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency. Biden followed this statement up the next day with a speech in Iowa, where he again blasted Trump’s travel ban, this time as “hysterical xenophobia”: We have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus. This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science. On February 15, Biden again attacked Trump’s immigration restrictions: Donald Trump’s inhumane, fear-based immigration policies are a stain on our nation. We have to get him out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants. The following month, on March 10, Biden was still lashing out at Trump’s travel restrictions as racist: A wall won’t stop a virus. Racism won’t stop a virus. Do your job. On March 11, Trump announced a European travel ban. The very next day, Biden railed against the idea: A wall will not stop the coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it. Let’s just pause for a moment to take this all in… Incredibly, as late as March 12, a mere eight days ago, Biden opposed Trump’s travel bans. So, without question, we can say that if Joe Biden were president right now, he would not have closed America’s borders, not even travel from Wuhan, China — not even after the virus was raging in Wuhan, China. Let’s go to the numbers… In 2018, nearly three million — million! — tourists from China visited the United States. That number rises every year, but let’s stick with that… Three million Chinese tourists a year means an average of 250,000 per month. That’s 8,300 per day. And that number does not include those arriving from other countries, anyone from any country who traveled to China, who were also a part of Trump’s January 31 ban. So, at what point would Biden have finally done the right thing and banned travel? Well, we know through his own statements, that Biden opposed these travel bans as late as March 12.  So I think we can safely say that a President Biden would not have acted any sooner than his ideological counterparts in the European Union, who did not close their borders until March 16, a mere four days ago. So let’s do the math… In our hypothetical world… President Biden, in an effort to “lead the way with science” and not “hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering,” would have allowed — between January 31 and March 16 — at least 375,000 travelers from China into the U.S. — people who did not get into our country thanks to President Trump’s “racist” and “xenophobic” travel ban. We can never know for sure just how much worse the Chinese virus would be right now in President Biden’s hypothetical America — we can’t know how many more Americans would be infected or dead as 375,000 tourists streamed in from a plague-infected country and unknowingly seeded themselves among us… But we do know that universally-respected expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist with the National Institutes of Health of the United States, believes the Trump’s travel bans — the ones Biden opposed as recently as eight days go — have “gone a long way to not seeding very, very intensively the virus in our country.” Dr. Fauci responds to question about differences between U.S. and Italy, says @realDonaldTrump stopping travel very early from China ""has gone a long way"" in fight against coronavirus ""Unfortunately, Italy did not do that. They had an open border."" pic.twitter.com/bf62gVytrH — Elizabeth Harrington (@LizRNC) March 20, 2020  FAUCI: One of the things we did right, was very early, cut off travel from China to the United States. Outside of China where it originated, the countries in the world that have it are through travel. Either directly from China or indirectly from someone who went someplace and then came to that particular country. Our shutting off travel from China, and more recently travel from Europe, has gone a long way to not seeding very, very intensively the virus in our country. Unfortunately, Italy did not do that. They had an open border. They let people in, and until they really knew they were in trouble — the horse was out of the barn, and that was it. In other words, a President Joe Biden would have let some 375,000 horses out of the barn and right into America… Can you imagine what that would look like? Can you imagine what American would look like right now had President Joe Biden allowed that to happen? And if that’s not a disqualifier for the presidency, then I ask you… What in God’s name is?

"Donald Trump berated NBC reporter Peter Alexander on Friday for suggesting he was offering “false hope” to Americans, by talking about the effectiveness of drugs like chloroquine to fight the Chinese coronavirus. “Is it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope and misrepresenting preparedness right now?” Alexander asked. Trump replied he was optimistic about the effectiveness of the drug chloroquine even though Dr. Anthony Fauci said during the briefing it was not clinically proven. “It may work and it may not work,” he said. “I feel good about it. that’s all it is, just a feeling.” “What do you see Americans who are watching you right now that are scared?” Alexander asked, citing the numbers of invected and people killed by the virus. “I say that you are a terrible reporter,” Trump replied. I think that’s a very nasty question, and I think it’s a very bad signal that you’re putting out to the American people.” Trump berated MSNBC/NBC/Comcast for promoting sensationalism. “I don’t call it Comcast, I call it Concast,” Trump said. “That’s really bad reporting.” Moving on to John Roberts from Fox News, Trump pointed to Alexander and said, “You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”  ",Watch: Donald Trump Blasts ‘Concast’ NBC Peter Alexander for Challenging Hopeful Message,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/watch-donald-trump-blasts-concast-nbc-peter-alexander-for-challenging-hopeful-message/,Breitbart
"Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), two prominent members of the far-left “Squad,” have publicly expressed support for Tucker Carlson’s call for Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) to resign for purportedly dumping up to $1.7 million in stock after receiving confidential coronavirus briefings. The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman reportedly unloaded “between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 33 separate transactions,” according to ProPublica. Those transactions coincided with the intelligence committee receiving daily briefings on the spread and threat of the coronavirus. Fox News’s Carlson forcefully called for Burr to resign during Thursday’s Tucker Carlson Tonight — a call both Omar and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to publicly support. “I am 100% with him on this,” Omar wrote alongside an emoji, expressing her shock: I am 💯 with him on this 😱 https://t.co/Gbi3i2BagY — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) March 20, 2020  Ocasio-Cortez also seemed to signal support: ὄ https://t.co/l1jQnspP3B — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 20, 2020  “You may have seen news reports this afternoon that chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee sold more than a million dollars in stock in mid-February after learning about how devastating the Chinese coronavirus could be,” Carlson said Thursday evening. “He had inside information about what could happen to our country, which is now happening,” he continued. “But he didn’t warn the public. He didn’t give a primetime address. He didn’t go on television to sound the alarm.” “He didn’t even disavow an op-ed he’d written just 10 days before claiming America was ‘better prepared than ever for coronavirus,” he added.

Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate and face prosecution for insider trading. There is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time crisis, and that appears to be what happened.

Loeffler called the claims of insider trading “false,” saying her transaction report will show she had no prior knowledge before a transaction took place. “I’ve seen some of those stories, and it’s absolutely false and could not be true,” Loeffler told host Ed Henry. “If you actually look at the personal transaction reports that were filed, it notices at the bottom that I am only informed of my transactions after they occur, several weeks. So, certainly, those transactions, at least on my behalf, were a mix of buys and sells — very routine for my portfolio.” She added, “I’m not involved in the decisions around buying and selling. There’s a range of different decisions made every single day with regard to my savings and 401(k) portfolio that I’m not involved in, and certainly, like any other trade, you can’t see into the future.” Loeffler then noted she has a history of working in the financial services industry, adding she understands the ethics rules that come in that industry.

"The U.S. government wants Google, Facebook, and other Big Tech companies to turn over the location data of Americans in order to help them monitor people’s compliance with social distancing guidelines amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Via NBC News: Federal health officials say they could use anonymous, aggregated user data collected by the tech companies to map the spread of the virus — a practice known as “syndromic surveillance” — and prevent further infections. They could also use the data to see whether people were practicing “social distancing.” The federal effort, first reported by The Washington Post, will force the tech giants to weigh their commitments to user privacy against their desire to help combat a disease that has cost thousands of human lives and upended the global economy. According to NBC, health officials have conducted two calls with representatives of major tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, Amazon, Twitter, and Apple. A source at one of the tech companies reportedly said that officials are “very serious” about the data-sharing plan. Google confirmed on Tuesday that the company is “exploring ways that aggregated anonymized location information could help in the fight against COVID-19. One example could be helping health authorities determine the impact of social distancing, similar to the way we show popular restaurant times and traffic patterns in Google Maps.” However, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said: “There is no agreement to share people’s location data with governments.” Are you an insider at Google, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?

"Appearing Friday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) praised China’s response to combat the coronavirus, despite the communist regime’s attempts to cover up the spread of the deadly illness.  A transcript is as follows:  MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Senator, is our system up to this? You were talking about our system needing to be up to this. Bank of America, major banks, are calling this a recession right now. What is it that keeps it from careening into a depression? SEN. GARY PETERS: You’ve got to keep people working. That’s important to understand that not everybody can necessarily go home and shelter-in-place. You still have to keep the economy moving. One thing that I’m particularly concerned about is when you think about critical supply chains, things like food, our grocery stores, we have to have people continuing to work. You got to continue to have some manufacturing going on. I think it’s important to realize, if you just shut down industries, it’s not like you can just push a button at some point in the future and start it back up again. It’s a lot more complex than that. And if you have a supply chain that’s been deteriorating, small businesses that close down and can’t re-open, some estimates say a very large percentage of these small businesses if they close, their not going to be able to re-open. That creates havoc in the supply chains. When we do get through the health crisis aspect of it, you can’t just turn on a switch to get the economy running right away. We’ve got to focus on that. While we’re dealing with the healthcare crisis, which is first and foremost, you’ve got to deal with that, but you’ve got make sure you’re helping families, you make sure unemployment insurance is there, you make sure families aren’t losing their homes or can’t buy food. At the same time, you’ve got to keep other elements of the economy going to work. We saw that in China. Outside of Hubei province, a lot of the factories continued to work. They separated their employees, they had partitions, they found ways to continue to keep some of the economy going in other parts of the country that weren’t impacted as much as it was in Hubei. We’ve got to be doing that same kind of thing here.

"The novel coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. will last at least 18 months and “could include multiple waves of illness,” prompting “significant shortages” for consumers and overwhelming the healthcare system, a federal government contingency plan leaked to the media this week warned. President Donald Trump’s anti-coronavirus plan, dated March 13 and delivered to policymakers, echoed the findings of a March 16 report by the U.K.’s Imperial College, which also found that the outbreak could “potentially” last “18 month or more” in the U.S. and strain the healthcare system “many times over.” The Imperial College’s epidemiology report reportedly helped push the Trump administration to escalate its efforts to combat the deadly and highly contagious disease, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing unnamed American officials. Jeremy Young, an assistant professor at Utah’s Dixie State University, broke down the Imperial College team’s findings on Twitter. We can now read the Imperial College report on COVID-19 that led to the extreme measures we've seen in the US this week. Read it; it's terrifying. I'll offer a summary in this thread; please correct me if I've gotten it wrong.https://t.co/AwE2cHIbeJ — Jeremy C. Young (@jeremycyoung) March 17, 2020  While Trump’s anti-coronavirus plan does not provide any information on infection fatalities, the Imperial College team predicted that the more intensive and socially disruptive the intervention measures are, the fewer people will die. The Imperial College team was able to make its predictions by entering coronavirus infection and death rates from China, South Korea, and Italy into epidemic modeling software and running simulations of what can happen in the United States. Even with three months of a combination of social distancing of people over 70, the isolation of suspect cases, and having their families quarantined — described as the mitigation strategy — there would be “1.1-1.2 million” deaths in the United States, and the health system would be “overwhelmed many times over,” Imperial College found. Mitigation would slow but not necessarily stop the spread of the virus, “reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection,” the researchers explained in the report. This mitigation strategy is what you've seen a lot of people talking about when they say we should ""flatten the curve"": try to slow the spread of the disease to the people most likely to die from it, to avoid overwhelming hospitals. — Jeremy C. Young (@jeremycyoung) March 17, 2020  Reducing the case numbers to low levels or eliminating human-to-human transmission, described as the suppression strategy, would require social distancing of the entire population, combined with home isolation of cases and the quarantine of their family, as well as shutting down public gatherings and most work places in addition to school and university closures. The intervention measures required for suppression would have to remain in place until a vaccine becomes available in 12-18 months or more. During those 18 months, things are going to be very difficult and very scary. Our economy and society will be disrupted in profound ways. And if suppression actually works, it will feel like we're doing all this for nothing, because infection and death rates will remain low. — Jeremy C. Young (@jeremycyoung) March 17, 2020  With the suppression strategy, fatalities would peak at a few thousand deaths, then go down. Imperial College warned that transmission would “quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.” Suppression works! The death rate in the US peaks 3 weeks from now at a few thousand deaths, then goes down. We hit but don't exceed the number of available ventilators. The nightmarish death tolls from the rest of the study disappear. — Jeremy C. Young (@jeremycyoung) March 17, 2020  After the 1st suppression period ends in July, we could probably lift restrictions for a month, followed by 2 more months of suppression, in a repeating pattern without triggering an outbreak or overwhelming the ventilator supply. Staggering breaks by city could do a bit better. — Jeremy C. Young (@jeremycyoung) March 17, 2020  If nothing is done to break chains of transmission, coronavirus-related fatalities will reach “2.2 million in the US, not accounting for the potential negative effects of health systems being overwhelmed on mortality,” the Imperial College report said. About 80 percent of the population would also be infected by the virus absent any action, the report added. Here's what would happen: 80% of Americans would get the disease. 0.9% of them would die. Between 4 and 8 percent of all Americans over the age of 70 would die. 2.2 million Americans would die from the virus itself. — Jeremy C. Young (@jeremycyoung) March 17, 2020  Asked when can Americans expect their lives to go back to normal during a press conference Thursday, Trump did not provide a specific time frame. “I hope very soon. We’ll see. This is uncharted territory,” he said. Echoing the Imperial College report while briefing reporters alongside Trump, Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, declared: [Modeling studies show] that if you add these things [intervention measures] together, they have a bigger impact than separately.  And so those are part of the decision-making.  We had a whole group of modelers in yesterday.  They’re compositing all the data together to look at this carefully because everyone has those same questions of what the impact [of the intervention measures] will be and what pieces could essentially be removed, and you still have the same level of impact in decreasing the spread of the virus. The absolute key to this, though, is every single American looking at the President’s guidelines and taking it seriously. Birx noted that state and local governments will ultimately decide how long the intervention measures will be in place. Trump and Birx acknowledged that Americans are pulling together as a nation to combat the coronavirus and for the most part doing what they are supposed to be doing when it comes to following guidelines to hinder the spread of the virus. The U.S. public may have to resign itself to over one million deaths (mitigation strategy) given that reducing the number of cases to the least amount possible (suppression strategy) may be unrealistic because of the detrimental impact 18 months or more of intervention measures will have on the economy. Imperial College acknowledged that imposing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing and quarantines, for 18 months or more would be an unprecedented feat that would have a “profound” impact on society and the economy. “We emphasize that is not at all certain that suppression will succeed long term; no public health intervention with such disruptive effects on society has been previously attempted for such a long duration of time. How populations and societies will respond remains unclear,” the report said. Nevertheless, it concluded that “epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.” The U.S. healthcare system will be overwhelmed even if the United States takes the less restrictive route to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Under the most optimistic mitigation strategy, the Imperial College noted, “The surge limits for both general ward and ICU [intensive care unit] beds would be exceeded by at least 8-fold.” The Trump administration issued its 100-page plan on Friday, the same day the president declared a national emergency. Consistent with the Imperial College report, the plan presented a grim prognosis for the spread of the disease and highlighted a response that would require action from agencies across the U.S. government and possibly employing special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector. Trump has already announced that he would use the Defense Production Act of 1950 to address severe shortages of supplies needed for combating the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. The Cold War-era law forces the American industry to intensify the production of essential equipment and supplies — ventilators, respirators, and protective gear for healthcare workers. Besides a vaccine, the U.S. is also working on developing other medicinal therapies to combat coronavirus symptoms that could take a few months to disseminate, Trump’s coronavirus task force indicated on Thursday.",Coronavirus Report that Prompted Stronger U.S. Action: 1M Deaths Even with Extreme Prevention Steps,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/coronavirus-report-that-prompted-stronger-u-s-action-1m-deaths-even-with-extreme-prevention-steps/,Breitbart
"Russian leader Vladimir Putin praised China’s response to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as a success in a phone call Thursday evening with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, according to official statements released by both Chinese and Russian state press agencies Thursday. Putin praised Xi’s efforts to stop the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, late last year. According to the Russian news agency TASS: The coronavirus pandemic situation was discussed in detail, with emphasis on tight cooperation Russian and China have set up from the beginning [of the outbreak]. Russian side has praised the results, achieved by the Chinese government and the entire Chinese people, in countering of the spread of the disease. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping spoke in favor of further mutual assistance and deepening of cooperation in medical field and drug development. Tass noted that “the leaders have also exchanged opinions on a number of other aspects of development of friendly Russian-Chinese relations.” China’s Foreign Ministry released a statement on the phone call Thursday in which it claimed that “thanks to the painstaking efforts made so far, the situation in China is steadily turning for the better, with life and work returning to normal at a faster pace.” The statement also said that during the phone conversation, “Putin commended the Chinese government for taking effective measures to not only contain the spread of the virus at home, but also contribute to safeguarding the health and safety of people across the world.” China lauded itself as an “example” to other countries now fighting the Chinese coronavirus, for which it remains directly responsible for originating and spreading. Continuing to praise its efforts to fight its own coronavirus, the Ministry added, “By providing timely assistance to other countries affected by COVID-19 [Chinese Coronavirus], China has set an example for the international community and responded, loud and clear, to the provocation and stigmatization by some country [sic].” China has responded loudly to criticism of its responsibility in spawning, spreading, and preventing the curtailment of the Chinese coronavirus. On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Ministry expelled more than a dozen U.S. journalists from three American newspapers in response to the U.S. State Department’s placing caps on Chinese media in March. The move came amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China during the past few months. The U.S. has continued to highlight the communist nation’s horrific human rights abuses against minority Muslims, support a pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, and rightly point out China’s responsibility in starting the Chinese coronavirus pandemic that continues to ravage the world’s economy and public health. The Chinese coronavirus has greatly contributed to this deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China. The Chinese reject any condemnation by the U.S. and others of China’s role in causing the pandemic and also for acting too little, too late, to prevent its spread out of China to the rest of the world. The U.S. has accused Beijing of delaying visits from American health experts to China in the aftermath of the outbreak. A Chinese Foreign Ministry official has also promoted a conspiracy theory that the U.S. army may have created the pathogen.",Putin Praises China’s Coronavirus Response in Phone Call with Xi Jinping,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/20/putin-praises-chinas-coronavirus-response-phone-call-xi-jinping/,Breitbart
"Friday during an interview on The Rush Limbaugh Show, Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute president Peter Schweizer, author of the book Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, said Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) should resign over stock sales he made weeks before the markets fell in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Schweizer said, “The Senator Burr example is particularly egregious. I’ve exposed corruption involving Republicans and Democrats for more than a decade, and this is really one of the worst situations. Bottom line: Senator Burr who in 2018 his net worth was around 1.7 million dollars essentially got briefings from federal officials saying how bad this pandemic was going to be and then over the course of the next couple days had 33 sale transactions of stock, representing at least, if not more of a half of his entire net worth. The point being you know he was not being bashful here. He was basically selling just about everything that he could sell. One week later, his stock portfolio would have been down 30% had he held that stock.” He added, “I think this needs to be taken up by the Department of Justice to see if it involves insider-trading. It needs to be taken up by the Senate leadership. We need to know who he talked to, who he shared this information with. I think frankly that given his conduct, he should resign.” Schweizer exposed the bipartisan corruption during the congressional insider trading scandal in 2011 which was detailed in his book Throw Them All Out: How Politicians and Their Friends Get Rich Off Insider Stock Tips, Land Deals, and Cronyism That Would Send the Rest of Us to Prison.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took time during Friday’s coronavirus press briefing to rebuff multiple attacks from offended journalists who repeatedly asked if President Trump’s treatment of the press is sending a negative message to other countries during the coronavirus pandemic. Pompeo addressed questions concerning disinformation, which some reporters purportedly viewed as an opportunity to knock the president. “What message do you think it sends to other countries when you have the President of the United States lashing out at reporters?” PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asked. “I’ve had my frustrations with reporters, too. All I ask when I talk to the media is that you listen to what we say and report it accurately. And it’s frustrating,” he said as brief banter erupted. “It’s enormously frustrating. We have a responsibility to tell the American people the truth,” he continued. “And those who are reporting on what it is we are doing and saying have an equal responsibility to report accurately.” However, Alcindor remained unsatisfied with the answer and repeated her question. Pompeo added that he has witnessed inaccurate reports “on multiple occasions” and said that in those instances, he spoke to the reporters and will “continue to do so.” The topic also came up earlier in the briefing as Pompeo addressed the issue of disinformation. “We’ve certainly seen it come from places like China and Russia and Iran,” he said of the “coordinated efforts to disparage what America is doing.” He added that the administration is doing “lots of things” to fight back and stressed the importance of the American people going to “trusted sources for their information”: But we’ve made clear we’ve spoken to these countries directly that they need to knock it off, that we don’t approve of it. And there are a handful of other things we’re engaged in to make sure the right information is out there and accurate information is given. This idea of transparency and accurate information is very important. It’s how we protect American people from something like this ever happening again. “Does it undermine you at all when the president stands up here and attacks news outlets, calling us untrustworthy?” Jill Colvin, White House reporter for the Associated Press, asked. “Does anybody else have a question?” Pompeo said as President Trump shook his head.",Mike Pompeo Rebuffs Attacks from Offended Reporters: ‘Enormously Frustrating’,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/mike-pompeo-rebuffs-attacks-offended-reporters-enormously-frustrating/,Breitbart
"Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, Greater London, has declared a “critical incident” because it does not have enough space in its critical care unit due to an influx of coronavirus patients. London North West University Healthcare Trust, which runs the hospital, sent a message to staff on Thursday night stating that they had “declared a ‘critical incident’ in relation to our critical care capacity at Northwick Park Hospital. This is due to an increasing number of patients with Covid-19.” “This means that we currently do not have enough space for patients requiring critical care. As part of our system resilience plans, we have contacted our partners in the North West London sector this evening to assist with the safe transfer of patients off of the Northwick Park site,” said the message, which was seen by Health Service Journal (HSJ) and reported on Friday. The report comes as another London NHS hospital trust — Lewisham and Greenwich — was reported to be turning away coronavirus patients and referring them to other local hospitals because they did not have the capacity to treat them themselves. “We’re running out of beds and running out of space. Some patients with Covid-19 are being shipped to other trusts,” a Lewisham and Greenwich hospital trust source told The Telegraph on Thursday, saying that, for example, on Tuesday when five patients needed critical care only one could be admitted, with the others sent to neighbouring facilities. Report: Overwhelmed London Hospitals Turning Away Coronavirus Patients https://t.co/t0phaqMSXM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  A senior medical professional at another London hospital trust told HSJ: “Given we’re in the low foothills of this virus, this is f***ing petrifying.” “I was in denial about the seriousness of this virus a couple of weeks ago, but not anymore,” he added. The senior director also told the medical news outlet that “trusts in outer London seem to be hit much worse at the moment, probably about two weeks ahead of the rest of the country. Barnet, Lewisham and Greenwich, Epsom and St Helier, North Middlesex and Hillingdon are all struggling.” Evoking the medical crisis hitting Italy, which has now more reported deaths due to the Chinese coronavirus than China, the senior director said: “The thing people aren’t really talking about yet is that we are going to have to quickly agree some clinical thresholds for admissions to intensive care. “This is what the Italians have had to do, and whether it’s set at 60 or whatever, we are going to have to do something similar. There’s no way we’re going to be able to scale up to the level we need otherwise.” Reports from last week revealed doctors in Italy saying that they are rationing care to older coronavirus patients. Dr Marcello Natali, 57, also died of coronavirus after working with patients without gloves because his hospital in Codogno had run out. He had said in a final interview: “We weren’t prepared for the coronavirus.

"Appearing Friday on CNBC, Ron Klain, who served as President Barack Obama’s Ebola czar, graded President Donald Trump’s response to the Chinese coronavirus an “F.”  A transcript is as follows:  RON KLAIN: Fairly, I’d have to say it’s an F and I’ll tell you why. First of all, the travel ban from China was always, only partial. If you had a true travel ban from China, we wouldn’t have the virus here. But it is right? And it’s here in very large numbers. Commercial cargo is always exempted, obviously, the return of U.S. citizens are always exempted. Even after this was in place thousands of people were coming from China every day. Now, we knew that and there’s no question that Dr. [Anthony] Fauci [an immunologist with the National Institutes of Health of the United States] is right, that it bought us some time. But we squandered that time, and if you look at the countries that have been most successful, they used the time they got, the time they knew the virus was coming until the time it came, to ramp up testing, to ramp up hospitals, to ramp up gear, to ramp up PPE [personal protective equipment]. We didn’t do any of those things. We sat around and spent those two months saying it’s not going to be here, 15 cases, it’s going to go to zero. What we’re living with now in the country, the virus was created by nature, but the failed response was created by decisions we made. I think we’re seeing the consequences of that. There’s no reason why America is testing at a fraction of the rate of South Korea, there’s no reason why we didn’t ramp up like Singapore to deal with this. “Certainly, the response is getting better now,” Klain concluded. “But we’re going to pay a huge price for squandering January, squandering February, squandering even a little bit of March.”",Obama’s Ebola Czar Ron Klain: Trump Gets an ‘F’ for Coronavirus Response,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/obamas-ebola-czar-ron-klain-trump-gets-f-coronavirus-response/,Breitbart

Trump replied he was optimistic about the effectiveness of the drug chloroquine even though Dr. Anthony Fauci said during the briefing it was not clinically proven. “It may work and it may not work,” he said. “I feel good about it. that’s all it is, just a feeling.” “What do you see Americans who are watching you right now that are scared?” Alexander asked, citing the numbers of invected and people killed by the virus. “I say that you are a terrible reporter,” Trump replied.

"Representative Scott DesJarlais (R-TN) gave President Donald Trump high marks regarding his handling of China and the regaining control of the American economy as the nation is grappling with the threat of the coronavirus pandemic. During an interview that aired on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN on Friday, the Tennessee Republican congressman argued a lesson learned from Mainland China’s handling of the coronavirus was how unstable and unreliable the communist nation is, which should warrant a “different attitude” toward it in the future. “There’s one guy that was talking about that during his campaign, and that’s President Trump,” he said. “He talked about how unfair China was being in terms of trade, stealing our secrets and all kinds of unfair practices. He took initial steps to work out fair trade agreements and work out different kinds of relationships. And we’ve learned how our global economy depending on China, is unstable at best. They’re not reliable. They’re communists. They don’t have to report. They’re not as accountable as we are in this country. So, I think if nothing else — we’ve learned a great lesson.” “And you know, the president stepped up early on when the Democratic House was still trying to impeach him and impose travel bans from China that was limiting about 10,000 people from coming into our country a day,” DesJarlais continued. “He got criticized for being a racist for doing that. And then when there started cropping up a few illnesses, they criticized that he wasn’t doing enough. I think the president has been ahead of the curve on this one, and he is trying to reset our relations with China. I think moving forward, we need to have a different attitude about how we do business, and not be so reliant on them in terms of the global economy.” DesJarlais also gave the Trump administration a vote of confidence in getting the U.S. economy back in order as it has been brought to its knees by the coronavirus outbreak. “Our economy was in literally the best shape it’s been just a few weeks ago — lowest unemployment, stock market at record levels breaking records every day,” DesJarlais said. “And then here because of their lack of transparency, the whole world is in this pandemic. I’m not saying it wouldn’t happen to some extent, but certainly, it wouldn’t be the numbers and the disruption we’re looking at now. So, everyone needs to reevaluate that relationship. And you know, I think our economy will recover just fine. I think Trump has set in place restructuring our manufacturing base. We have the tax cuts. We should be able to bring some of these pharmaceutical companies back to our country to produce the prescription drugs that we need at better prices. So I think once that we get through this, and I’m positive we will.” “I’m confident in the job the presidential his team, Vice President Pence have been doing,” he continued. “And I think sooner rather than later, we’ll be on the road to recovery. There is no reason the economy shouldn’t bounce back. Now,  a lot of people are hurting now and are going to be hurt. And so, that’s why this stimulus is normally something I would not be for. I certainly opposed Obama’s stimulus. He put a trillion dollars into the economy, and I think to this day we cannot account for more than $200 billion of what he spent. But in this case where the government is mandating shutdowns, telling people to stay home and not go to work, then you can’t do much about that. So, I do think the government has a role in helping in that recovery.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",GOP Rep.

"On Friday, President Trump took a crucial step in protecting American citizens during the coronavirus pandemic.  He completed the closure of the land ports of entry into the United States to nonessential traffic. In other words, he closed the front door. But the back door remains wide open. Because of congressional inaction for decades, the vast majority of the southern border remains unprotected. More than 1,000 miles of border with Mexico has no effective barrier to stop pedestrian traffic. In times of global pandemic, it is essential that our country be able to control who enters and be able to screen those who do.  Now, more than ever, borders matter. As I wrote in January, last year there was a massive increase in the number of Chinese nationals sneaking across the Mexican border. In FY 2019, the number of Chinese migrants caught at the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector increased 85%, from approximately 700 to over 1,300.   Thousands of Chinese nationals successfully entered the country illegally across the southern border in FY 2019. And none of them were screened for the coronavirus. Not tests, no quarantines, nothing. Unfortunately, that huge flow of Chinese illegal aliens has created travel networks that other Chinese nationals have been able to use to evade the travel ban from China that President Trump prudently announced on January 31. And it’s happening. As of this writing, according to Border Patrol figures, more than 350 Chinese nationals have been apprehended at the southern border since January 1. And for every illegal alien who’s caught, one can assume that three made it in without getting caught. That means that more than 1,000 Chinese nationals have entered illegally this year already—most of them after the Chinese travel ban was put in place. As long as our border remains wide open, no travel ban will be completely effective. That is a powerful lesson of this crisis.  Let’s hope that Congress learns it and completes the funding for the entire southern border wall as soon as possible.

"Calls are increasing for cable networks to stop airing President Donald Trump’s press conferences live as critics believe Trump is turning White House news briefings into virtual campaign rallies that can “get people killed” with lies about the Coronavirus crisis. The pressure only increased after Trump’s Friday briefing. The Atlantic’s James Fallows believes the attention-starved Trump is turning the press conferences into “virtual campaign” rallies and Trump would actually lose interest in showing up if the media did not cover the briefings live. “Also, as a practical matter, if the briefings were no longer covered live, Trump would lose interest in attending himself,” Fallows argues. “Then the scientists could come back on stage—and eventually they could be covered live again.” Fallows noticed that Trump only “dropped his previous pooh-poohing of the virus threat” and “struck a somber” tone for just a day before reverting “back to the more accustomed tone of tweets and his rallies. In those settings he has had two constant themes: that he is so great, and that his critics are such cheating losers, each point usually based on information that was false”: The tone, and the false data, returned yesterday. Much of what Trump said was false: Most dramatically, his claim that the FDA had just approved use of an anti-malaria drug for treatment of COVID-19, and that it would be a “game-changer.” (FDA officials immediately clarified that they had done no such thing.) Trump’s new fondness for these “briefings,” and their increasing conversion into Trump campaign rallies with scientists rather than local-government officials as the supporting cast, should cause cable-news producers to reflect on the path they are headed down. In the year after Trump declared his candidacy in the summer of 2015, cable channels ran so many of his “Lock her up!” rallies live and at full length, that the coverage amounted to hugely valuable free campaign publicity. One source calculated the free-airtime values as being worth several billion dollars. From Trump’s point of view, it makes sense to turn these events into the unfiltered airtime he used to count on at mass rallies. From the media’s point of view, it made sense to cover the first few of them live. But given the rising falsehood quotient in what Trump says, and his determination to cut off or divert questioners who try to ask about these falsehoods, cable networks should stop airing these as live spectacles and instead report, afterwards, with clips of things Trump and others said, and whether they were true. Their real reason for live coverage back during Trump’s rise was that ratings went up: People wanted to watch these spectacles. Even if that’s still true, we certainly have learned that Trump will use most of his time to attack and lie, and that panelists’ corrections never catch up. In time of crisis, cable-news channels are making the public less informed, and thus increasing public danger, by providing such a convenient platform for lies. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday evening ripped Trump for being “wildly irresponsible” and “consistently lying” by telling “fairy tales” during the live briefings. “If it were up to me, and it’s not, I would stop putting those briefings on live TV. Not out of spite but because it’s misinformation,” Maddow said. “If Trump is going to keep lying like he has been every day on stuff this important, we should, all of us, stop broadcasting it. Honestly, it’s going to cost lives.” Maddow: If Trump is going to keep lying like he has been every day on stuff this important, we should, all of us, stop broadcasting it. Honestly, it's going to cost lives. pic.twitter.com/tMvyrE3YTK — Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) March 21, 2020  At the Boston Globe, columnist Michael A. Cohen writes that “the simple fact is that the president can’t be trusted to tell the truth. Period. In a crisis as grave as this one, allowing him to spread misinformation is an unacceptably risky move.” “Practically every time Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus pandemic he lies, exaggerates, offers false hope, and spreads misinformation. His statements are increasingly a menace to public safety. It’s time for cable news networks to stop giving him a platform for his untruths by refusing to provide live coverage of his press conferences,” Cohen argues. Cohen adds that he does not “take this position lightly…. but these are not ordinary times and this is no ordinary president.” To Cohen, “it’s bad enough that Trump Is lying about his administration’s incompetent response to the coronavirus,” but Trump is now “sowing doubt about the credibility of news organizations that are essential to providing clear and honest information to the American people.” “At a moment of true national cataclysm, allowing him to use the bully pulpit in such an irresponsible manner is a risk we can’t afford to take,” Cohen continues. “His words raise the risk that Americans — particularly those who support the president — will ignore public health information that could potentially save lives.” Others have suggested that the media just “record” any presser Trump attends and then “tell people what is true and what is false.” Stop airing Trump live, you will get people killed. https://t.co/ijmwuRBEYx https://t.co/gPOlzFPhab — Jamison Foser (@jamisonfoser) March 19, 2020  Take Away Trump’s Microphone https://t.co/cCsUZE7zuy — Michael Cohen (@speechboy71) March 20, 2020  The country is going through a lot of trauma and the least television media can do is stop airing these press conferences live.

"On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “The Story,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) stated that he doesn’t believe Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), James Inhofe (R-OK), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) “would intentionally trade on inside information” and that if any inside information was given out in any coronavirus briefings, he didn’t hear it, but “it is a very bad look.” Kennedy said, “I have read the same news reports that you have. I have not talked with my four colleagues, but each has an explanation. I know them pretty well. I don’t believe any one of them would intentionally trade on inside information. Sen. Burr, to his credit, has said, look, I want an Ethics investigation. I suspect that the others will follow. In America, just because you’re accused of something, doesn’t mean you’re guilty of it. Having said that, it is a very bad look.” He added that there has been a large amount of “equivocation” in even the classified briefings on the coronavirus, and “If there was any inside information given out, I didn’t hear it.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","GOP Sen.

"Fox News’s Tucker Carlson says the “corrupt” EB-5 visa program is selling American citizenship to rich Chinese nationals. In a segment this week, Carlson called out the EB-5 visa program, whereby wealthy foreign nationals can claim they will invest in the United States at least $900,000 — the previous rate was $500,000 — securing green cards for themselves and their family members in the process. “Something called an EB-5 permanent resident visa is available to foreign nationals who start businesses here who employ at least 10 people … now, at the moment, most of these EB-5 visas go to Chinese nationals in order to finance real estate projects in our cities — one of the reasons housing costs are so high,” Carlson said. Carlson continued: According to congressional investigators, fraud and criminal activity are rampant in the program. Often it’s nothing more than a money-laundering scheme. A few people get rich by selling a path to citizenship for Chinese nationals and their children. In fact, the program is so rotten that last year Democrats and Republicans actually came together to reform it, to make it more restrictive. Consider that, Democrats making it harder for foreigners to get citizenship. But they did because the program is that corrupt. [Emphasis added] Carlson named Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) as the main proponent of greatly increasing the EB-5 visa program, thus rewarding more Chinese nationals, after reports circulated that he was pushing to include the measures in legislation aiding Americans during the coronavirus crisis. “But Sen. Graham loves it. He’s trying to use the current crisis to roll back reforms to the EB-5 visa program,” Carlson said. “He’d like to increase the number of visas to 75,000 a year. That’s a jump of more than seven times the current number. He’d also like to lower the investment requirement to just $450,000.” Coronavirus: Chinese Elite May Win More U.S. Citizenship-for-Investment Visas Despite Scandalshttps://t.co/rAkckRQ6M5 — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 20, 2020  During Sean Hannity’s show, Graham responded to the reports by denying ever pushing to increase the EB-5 visa program in a coronavirus aid bill. At the same time, Graham praised the EB-5 visa program. “I haven’t talked to anybody on the planet, much less the Trump administration, about putting EB-5 on the coronavirus bill,” Graham said. Currently, 10,000 foreign nationals and their families are allowed to enter the U.S. every year on the EB-5 visa. The overwhelming majority of EB-5 visas are rewarded to China’s elite — driving a migration of rich Chinese to cities across the country. In 2018, the U.S. rewarded nearly 8,000 wealthy foreign investors and their family members with green cards. Between 2014 and 2018, the federal government gave EB-5 visas to about 43,130 wealthy foreign investors and their family members, who can secure American citizenship after five years living in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"In 1973, as Israel was reeling from a surprise attack on Yom Kippur, Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan was in a state of shock. The overconfident Dayan, the hero of the Six Day War, had been certain the Arab states would never strike. But with Syrian tanks poised to descend the Golan, and Egyptian infantry killing Israeli armor with Sagger missiles, Dayan was shattered. “The destruction of the Third Temple is at hand,” he told fellow commanders. On the third day of the war, Dayan prepared to address the nation on television. He provided an off-the-record briefing to Israeli journalists before he did so, giving them a preview of what he would tell a nation stunned by sudden war. Elinor Burkett recalls the scene in her biography of Israel’s then-prime minister, Golda Meir: Dayan’s voice trembled as he talked about Egypt’s “unlimited equipment. It’s fantastic. It’s terrible to fight against such things … The question is: What will come next.” No doubt they’ll launch an attack with maximum strength, he predicted, and Israel will have to retreat. Dayan believed that he was providing Israelis with an honest assessment of their situation, but Gershom Schocken, the editor of Ha’aretz, counseled against sharing that view with the nation. “If you say on television tonight what you have told us, that will be like an earthquake for the consciousness of the Israel nation, the Jewish people, and the Arab nations,” he warned him. Another editor called Golda, who replaced Dayan on television with the former chief of military intelligence, who offered a more sanitized version of the truth. “[Dayan] was beaten and defeated,” said the editor of Ma’ariv. “It’s lucky for us that Golda wouldn’t let him appear on television. He would have announced our surrender.” If Schocken believed his only duty was to report what was actually going on, he would have allowed Dayan to go on television. He could also have raised his concerns publicly, and let Israel burn. But he had another duty, too. Eventually, Meir listened to her other generals. The situation was tough, they said, but winnable. After heavy losses, Israel eventually pushed the Syrians back across the border and crossed the Suez into Egypt itself. That episode holds lessons for us today as we consider the media’s coverage of President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. A journalist has a duty to report the truth, and to hold the media to account. But a journalist is also a member of a community, and a citizen of a nation. And right now, the American people are in danger. It is a danger that few of us could have foreseen — and this is proven by the fact that so few journalists bothered to cover it until it was almost upon us, until the “experts” and the political opposition had already derided the president’s life-saving travel ban, several weeks before. When Peter Alexander of NBC News asked President Trump on Friday about a malaria drug, chloroquine, that he had touted as a possible treatment for coronavirus, he was asking a legitimate question. Trump gave an honest answer: he did not disagree with Dr. Anthony Fauci that there was no clinical proof yet of the drug’s efficacy, but he believed that chloroquine was worth a try — and it had the added advantage of being approved already as safe for use. Alexander then followed up by asking whether the president was giving people “false hope.” To borrow a phrase from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that’s not a question. It is a political comment. Alexander confirmed his political motivations in a statement after their exchange, claiming Trump could not empathize with Americans. The media should not be expected to shower the president with praise. And by asking him tough questions about the efficacy of the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, they will make that response better. We also have an election coming in November, and the media should not ignore criticism from the opposition simply because of the crisis. But there is a way to ask questions and to report facts without adding unnecessarily to the fear and discord of the country. Journalists cannot behave as it they live inside a bubble, insulated from what the country is going through. Networks like CNN, which are the main source of international news for many people in other countries, also have — like it or not — a responsibility to represent the country well, not to distort our image through a partisan lens. We are all in this together, and journalists can do their duty while still being patriotic. Let’s all try to pull together. Joel B.

"Parents throughout America may be struggling to find ways to encourage their children’s learning while working from home themselves during the coronavirus crisis. Many school districts are ill-equipped to conduct full online learning, but, despite the situation, parents can meet the challenge of providing educational experiences for their children of any age and may find it to be a very rewarding opportunity at that. First and foremost, parents can de-stress immediately with the knowledge they do not need to replicate school at home. Remember that schools must provide services to many children at once, and now you can devote time to your children alone. Ty Salvant, a veteran homeschooler with six children and founder of Louisiana’s NOLA Homeschoolers, emphasized to Fox 8 that parents don’t need to provide six to eight hours of instructional time daily for their children. “One of the tips I give to families of elementary age and younger students is that two hours of instruction is enough, and it doesn’t have to be consecutive,” Salvant said, adding that four hours is appropriate for high school-age children. Consider scheduling the most challenging learning activities in the morning when children may have the most energy. Build in breaks and time for fun activities outside, if possible. Remember, as well, not every subject has to be taught each day. Build in time for household chores – learning responsibility is part of a child’s education. Think of creative ways to make divvying up chores more fun. For example, play “restaurant” one night per week and have children join in making the family meal that night. Alternate roles of “chef,” who chooses and helps prepare the meal with the help of “assistants,” and “waiters,” who set and clear the table. Parents who are working from home might consider a daily schedule that includes their “office hours,” a block of time when they may need to be on the phone or on a web conference and cannot be disturbed, except for emergencies. It’s best to schedule activities that are of high interest to children during these times, so they are more motivated to work or play independently. Don’t overlook board games as educational tools. Children can learn a great deal from games, not the least of which is how to read the body language of one’s opponent – a talent that can be missed when only video games are available. There is no lack of online education tools to help parents during this adjustment to education at home. However, where there is a need for broadband and WiFi internet access, Spectrum is offering both services free to students affected by the school closures during the coronavirus crisis. Charter Communications, Spectrum’s parent company, announced that it would make these services available beginning March 16 for 60 days to households with K-12 and/or college students who don’t already have internet through the company. Xfinity is also offering new customers in a Comcast area 60 days of complimentary Internet Essentials service. The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), a national homeschooling association, offers ideas on how to get started with home education. The Homeschool Resource Roadmap was developed by veteran homeschooler Tina Hollenbeck and provides prospective home educators with information about more than 4,000 resources. Homegrown Learners is a website developed by a former public school teacher-turned-homeschooling-parent. The site features curriculum ideas for children of every age and a blog that provides parents with encouragement. Christian homeschooling site Abeka Academy is hosting “online events” to help parents choose curriculum that is most appropriate for their children. Well-Trained Mind Academy offers classical education curriculum for middle and high school students. The American Heritage Education Foundation is a favorite source for homeschoolers for American history instruction for younger children. For older high school students, Hillsdale College provides its celebrated free online courses in history, politics, literature, philosophy, and religion – nearly a full program of learning for an older student. Parents with children who have been diagnosed with autism may want to check out Model Me Kids, which sells apps, videos, and software to teach social skills training for students aged 2-21. The company is offering a 25 percent-off discount on all their social skills training products during this time with the code MMK25OFF. U.S. Parents Involved in Education (USPIE) encourages parents to take control of their children’s education during this time and invites them to experience the flexibility that home education offers: One of the most valuable opportunities of home schooling is reigniting your children’s love of learning. Try to relax and live in the moment. If your child wants to spend all day reading about dinosaurs, let them. You can easily integrate math questions, history questions, verbal presentation skills, research skills and more all into a focused day – or even a week – on dinosaurs! It’s also fine to have “book-reading days.” Parents can take pride in giving their children the opportunity to read the classics and to spend as much time as they like reading – an experience they may not have in traditional schools. Jamie Gass, education director of the Boston-based Pioneer Institute, recommends a “top five” book series to explore as parents are educating at home. He suggests the Core Knowledge Curriculum Series, the Classic Starts Series, Great Illustrated Classics, the Who Was? Series, and the Geraldine McCaughrean series. For children who tend to avoid fiction, parents might consider Kate Klise’s Regarding the Fountain series. Neal McCluskey, director of Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, recently spoke to Breitbart News about the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on education. “It’s pretty well established that lots of change happens in a crisis,” he said. Similarly, homeschooling parent Courtney Ostaff, who worked with Well-Trained Mind Academy, told the New York Post, “So many people do not start homeschooling on purpose but kind of fall into it.” “It’s the same for people doing it because of the coronavirus,” she added. “They’re not alone and need to take a deep breath and think to themselves: ‘We’ve got this.’”",Helpful Tips and Websites for Parents Schooling at Home,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/helpful-tips-and-websites-for-parents-schooling-at-home/,Breitbart
"Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) was one of only three members of the United States Senate to oppose bipartisan legislation in 2012 barring lawmakers from using non-public information to reap profits on the stock market. Burr, who at the time had just been reelected to his second term representing North Carolina in Congress, opposed the STOCK Act on the basis that there were already existing laws in place to address insider trading. The fact that existing laws were rarely used to punish members of Congress for insider trading, despite their being plenty of evidence such dealings took place, seemed not to the bother the senator. “We’re doing this at a time when we should be talking about the economy and jobs,” the senator told North Carolina reporters shortly after voting against the bill. “Why do the (American people) think so little of us? Because we’re not even debating the things that are most important to them.” At the time of Burr’s vote, the STOCK Act was widely popular with political figures on both the left and the right. It not only garnered the endorsement of President Barack Obama but also staunch Tea Party conservative then-Senator Jeff Sessions. The idea for the legislation stemmed from revelations in Throw Them All Out: How Politicians and Their Friends Get Rich Off Insider Stock Tips, Land Deals, and Cronyism That Would Send the Rest of Us to Prison by Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News and president of the Government Accountability Institute. In his book, Schweizer detailed how both Republicans and Democrats in Congress sold stock in 2008 after receiving closed-door briefings on the imminent financial crisis. Burr’s opposition to the popular law comes back into the spotlight as the senator is under fire for unloading thousands of dollars worth of stock less than a week before the stock market sharply dropped because of the coronavirus pandemic. The senator’s timely sell-off netted between $628,000 and $1.72 million. Most of the shares were in companies like Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Hilton that took an especially hard hit as coronavirus travel restrictions went into place. More troubling is that the transactions, 33 in total, came as the Intelligence Committee, which Burr chairs, was receiving daily briefings on the pandemic. Given that fact, when news of the sell-off broke, speculation began to stir that the senator had acted on inside information to protect his assets. If true, Burr could potentially be found in violation of the STOCK Act. On Friday, as calls for him to resign over the matter grew, Burr admitted that the coronavirus pandemic had played a role in his decision to sell, but he asserted he did not act on information privileged to only members of Congress. “I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13,” Burr said in the statement, before urging the Senate Ethics Committee to launch an investigation into his conduct.",Richard Burr Voted Against Bipartisan 2012 Bill Barring Congressional Insider Trading,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/richard-burr-voted-against-bipartisan-2012-bill-barring-congressional-insider-trading/,Breitbart
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, via executive order on Friday, told restaurants statewide to halt dine-in services and suspended elective medical procedures as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the country. The Florida governor is ordering dining rooms in restaurants to close as part of a statewide effort to curb the impact of the coronavirus. Restaurants will still be able to offer delivery and take-out, per the order. “I hereby order all restaurants and food establishments licensed under Chapters 500 and 509, Florida Statutes, within the State of Florida to suspend on-premises food consumption for customers,” the order reads. It adds: Notwithstanding the foregoing, such establishments may operate their kitchens for the purpose of providing delivery or take-out services. Employees, janitorial personnel, contractors and delivery personnel shall be allowed access to such establishments for the purposes of delivery or take-out services. Additionally, while the order prohibits the sale of alcohol to be consumed on the premises, it allows restaurants to sell alcoholic beverages to-go under certain conditions. The order reads in part: The restriction in section 561.20(2)(a)4., Florida Statutes, prohibiting a specially licensed food service establishment from selling package sales of alcohol for delivery, take-out or consumption off-premises is suspended for restaurants complying with Executive Order 20-68, through the expiration of the state of emergency declared in Executive Order 20-52, including any extensions, so long as the following conditions are met: 1) Any sale of an alcoholic beverage in a sealed container for consumption off premises is accompanied by the sale of food within the same order; and 2) Any delivery of an alcoholic beverage complies with section 561.57,
Florida Statutes. DeSantis also ordered gyms and fitness centers to close, although it does not extend to “amenities of hotels which have a capacity of 10 persons or less.” He also issued an executive order restricting non-essential elective medical procedures. The order reads in part: All hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, office surgery centers, dental, orthodontic and endodontic offices, and other health care practitioners’ offices in the State of Florida are prohibited from providing any medically unnecessary, non-urgent or non-emergency procedure or surgery which, if delayed, does not place a patient’s immediate health, safety, or wellbeing at risk, or will, if delayed, not contribute to the worsening of a serious or life-threatening medical condition.

"A group of President Donald Trump’s campaign staffers conducted a Bible study online on Friday morning as the spread of the coronavirus continues in the United States. “We managed to do our weekly Bible study digitally!” wrote National Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Twitter, sharing a photo of her participating with campaign colleagues on a live stream feed. “Loved joining my friends from the Donald Trump campaign and GOP this Friday morning.” But this was not the first time the group met to read scripture and pray together. Trump campaign employees started the weekly Bible study in February, according to campaign sources, after McEnany, Lyndee Rose, Sonny Nelson, and Ryann McEnany brainstormed the idea. The group of up to two dozen staffers meets every Friday morning before work for Bible study, reading Scripture for about 30 minutes followed by 15 minutes of community prayer. Bagels are also served every week for those that attend, and staffers who find themselves on the road can call in. “This is oftentimes the most powerful part of our time together because you can feel Christ at work,” a campaign staffer told Breitbart News about the event. The event became even more significant to participants as they find themselves separate from colleagues and working from home while keeping up with the news about the virus that has dominated the headlines. Friday’s online study session was led by Dr. Tom Mullins, the Founding Pastor of Christ Fellowship, who is also a member of the Evangelicals for Trump coalition. “There is nothing more meaningful than coming together in prayer,” McEnany told Breitbart News in an interview about the group. She described the group’s weekly Bible study as “the most inspirational part of our week.” “As Christian men and women, our Bible study helps us to keep our eyes and mind on Christ,” she continued. “It offers a time to pray for our President and pray for our nation.” We managed to do our weekly Bible study digitally!

"Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has drafted an amendment to a Republican plan that will ensure millions of very low-income, poor Americans are eligible for $1,200 or more in federal payments in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. Current legislation to give a quasi-Universal Basic Income (UBI) to Americans excludes those making under $2,500 or less a year. These are the lowest, poorest Americans and also American college students who do not necessarily work all year long. Hawley’s amendment would end that income threshold and give money all Americans with a Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. “Relief to families in this emergency shouldn’t be regressive,” Hawley wrote online. “Lower-income families shouldn’t be penalized.” Here’s what I propose to fix this bill: don’t penalize lower-income families. Make direct relief available to all individuals and families from middle class down — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) March 20, 2020  Cash to Americans — a plan originally touted by businessman Andrew Yang as a permanent program that would replace all existing forms of welfare — was most recently touted by Breitbart News’s Economic Editor John Carney, who called on Congress to implement a policy in which every American, including those earning over $75,000 a year, are sent the payment: We need to put cash into the hands of the American people as quickly as possible. [Emphasis added] I propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending. [Emphasis added] This will not stop all the job losses but it will make them less painful. More importantly, it will make it far less likely that we go from stage one to stage two. It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects. [Emphasis added] Millions of American workers have been forced to stay home from their jobs, as restaurants, bars, and other businesses have been required to close in many states. These service industry workers generally rely on tips and minimum wage to pay their rent, mortgage, and other monthly bills. Often, they have no longtime financial security in place to tap into during emergency situations. In total, the latest JPMorgan Chase analysis finds that about one-in-four American families do not have any savings and nearly half of Americans would struggle to pay $400 to cover an emergency.

"The company Distributed Bio is three to four weeks away from engineering an antibody treatment to combat the novel coronavirus that can be ready to be administered to patients by the fall, Dr. Jacob Glanville, the co-founder and CEO of the business, proclaimed this week. “We’re moving super fast on this,” Dr. Glanville from the Netflix series Pandemic told Fox News on Thursday. He explained: What my company is doing is adapting antibodies to recognize and neutralize the novel coronavirus. So this would … [be] sort of skipping what a vaccine does. Instead of giving you a vaccine and waiting for it to produce an immune response, we just give you those antibodies right away. And so within about 20 minutes, that patient has the ability to neutralize the virus. … We’re making an antibody [therapy] that can be tried in humans in the summer. … That sets us up by September to be able to use something called compassionate use, which is to say, if it works well in the summer, we can start handing it out to hundreds of thousands of people who need it by the fall.  Dr. Glanville noted that the U.S. military would conduct a human study of his company’s antibody treatment this summer before doctors hand medicine out to patients. He said: The completed drug is going to go to the USAMRIID [United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]. So that’s the U.S. military, and they’re going to be testing it for its ability to neutralize the virus. At the same time, that drug is going to go to Charles River Laboratories, which is an international contract research group, which is going to test the safety of that drug. Both of those pieces of information come together so that we can produce batches, go through some red tape, and then do the first human studies that we’ll do on 200 to 600 people in the summer, probably in July. Glanville said that while “social distancing” is working to stem the spread of the coronavirus or COVID-19, medicine is needed to contain the disease further. This week, U.S. President Donald Trump touted the “right to try” bill he signed into law in late May. The legislation cuts regulations hindering compassionate use, which allows doctors to give experimental drugs to seriously ill patients if other treatments are unavailable. Trump noted that his administration continues to “slash red tape” to distribute unapproved coronavirus therapies and vaccines to patients faster and identify effective drugs. According to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, a coronavirus vaccine is at least 12 months away. The White House has acknowledged that the medical community is working on developing non-vaccine treatments in the next few months to combat coronavirus. Some experimental drugs have already yielded promising results. Without a vaccine or treatment, the coronavirus outbreak could last 18 months or more in the United States, the Trump administration has determined.",Doctor: My Company Is 3 to 4 Weeks from Developing a Therapy to ‘Neutralize’ Coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/doctor-my-company-is-3-to-4-weeks-from-developing-a-therapy-to-neutralize-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Friday, CNN anchor Jake Tapper took a jab at President Donald Trump for his pushback on a question from NBC News’ Peter Alexander at the coronavirus press briefing. Tapper said, “To those paying attention, the president’s outburst is the latest evidence that he should perhaps consider Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Fauci and others leading the coronavirus task force at the White House take the helm at the daily press conferences. I don’t want to eat up too much time in the show today, discussing President Trump’s behavior. We have too many life and death issues to discuss. But while President Trump should clearly be heralded for closing off flights from China early on and the government is currently working now on the pandemic, we cannot ignore that much of Mr. Trump’s personal response to the pandemic has been insufficient and deceptive and not focused enough clearly on one issue—saving lives.” He continued, “For months, the president belittled the threat of the virus. He only recent acknowledged the gravity of the crisis. I could provide video clips of all this, but I don’t want to waste your time, you know it’s true. Even after President Trump clearly understood what was going on, too many of the messages he’s been delivering from that podium are promises of things that are far off or maybe won’t actually happen. The hospital masks that are not yet ready, the website he discussed that’s just local in the Bay Area. He keeps talking up a medicine. It’s not even clear it will be effective. Hospital ships remain weeks away from arrival in port. Peter Alexander is a fine reporter for NBC News, which just lost an audio technician to coronavirus. He just died. Peter’s question would have been easy for any other politician. It was basically, Mr. President, please reassure frightened Americans.” He added, “Indeed Vice President Pence did not have a problem answering the question. If the president is not capable of leading stably and effectually, he should, at least, for his own reputation, for the good of the country, stop making things worse and consider leaving the podium to others.

"States across the country put a halt to elective surgery to save medical resources for fighting the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, but Massachusetts is making sure women can end the lives of their unborn children without impediment. The Massachusetts Department of Health issued a statement: DPH defines nonessential, elective invasive procedures as procedures that are scheduled in advance because the procedure does not involve a medical emergency; provided, however, that terminating a pregnancy is not considered a nonessential, elective invasive procedure for the purpose of this guidance. The New Boston Post reported on the development: The statement does not explain why abortions are exempted from the ban. A spokesman for the state’s public health agency acknowledged a request for comment from New Boston Post early Wednesday afternoon, but did not immediately provide one. Among the surgical procedures deemed “nonessential” by the state’s public health agency are: The Post noted that the abortion industry, which has ended the lives of more than 60 million unborn babies since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision made abortion on demand the law of the land, are pleased with the decision, including Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts. NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts said in a statement: We thank the Baker Administration for working to preserve continued access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion care during this unprecedented public health crisis. Reproductive health care decisions are time-sensitive and patients need speedy access to care. We recognize the intense strain COVID-19 has put and will continue to put on the healthcare system and we are grateful to the administration for listening to our concerns and recognizing the unique impact of COVID-19 on maintaining access to reproductive health care. But Andrew Beckwith, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, is outraged by the decision, the Post reported. “Planned Parenthood’s priority is to keep killing babies even when the whole world is focused on saving as many lives as possible right now, and they’ve even managed to convince the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to prioritize elective abortions during the current health crisis,” Beckwith said in a telephone interview. Massachusetts Citizens for Life provided a written statement to the Post: We were disheartened to learn that, upon Governor Baker’s approval, elective abortion will still be permitted in the coming weeks, even while other elective surgeries have been prohibited due to the coronavirus pandemic. Women’s health and safety should be our top priority now, as always. Risking exposure to the highly contagious disease during visits to abortion clinics not only puts our women at risk but their families and those of clinic workers as well. This is yet another indication that the once-popular abortion-rights mantra ‘safe, legal, and rare’ is a complete farce. In the face of a global pandemic, the abortion industry once again demonstrates that protecting women’s health has never been its priority. Instead, the abortion lobby’s singular goal is to increase the bottom line, even at the expense of risking the health and wellbeing of those who enter their clinics and those who work at them during these unprecedented times.

"The Trump administration continued its rapid response to the coronavirus crisis by announcing this week that small businesses and individuals can delay federal tax payments for 90 days. This move will significantly increase the cash flow for small firms, which are struggling to generate revenue as customers stay home and supply chains are disrupted. Late Wednesday night, President Trump signed into law the “Phase 2” coronavirus legislation that Congress passed this week. This legislation requires small businesses to temporarily provide paid medical leave for affected employees, the costs of which will be reimbursed by the federal government through tax credits. The Treasury Department will help small businesses that may not have the cash flow to make it to tax time by offering advanced tax credit refunds. And the Labor Department will issue exemptions for small businesses facing dire hardship from this mandate. The biggest government response to the coronavirus crisis is still to come. Sen. McConnell unveiled a roughly $1 trillion stimulus package on Thursday to help mitigate the economic pain that tens of millions of Americans are already feeling. The Senate plans to pass this legislation soon. The North Star of this “Phase 3” response legislation is ensuring that the country’s 30 million small businesses, which employ 60 million Americans, maintain the cash flow they need to stay operational — not just pay sick leave — during this turmoil. Small companies are on the front lines of this war, and they will be the springboard that propels the American economy out of this downturn. The Phase 3 plan presented by Sens. Marco Rubio (FL) and Susan Collins (ME) has a lot for small businesses to like. Under their proposal, which is part of the broader Phase 3 legislation, the federal government would provide loans to employers to cover payroll and other operational expenses. To the extent that the companies’ employees are still employed at the end of the loan period, which runs from March 1st to June 30th, the loan would turn into a grant and be forgiven. This approach could provide small businesses with the cash flow they need to pay their employees and stay open. This plan is especially attractive for small businesses because the loans would be provided at local banks — backed by the Treasury — so employers could access the liquidity they need immediately without having to appeal to the Small Business Administration. The measure would incentivize employment, keeping ordinary Americans in the workforce long enough to ride out the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. Its costs would be partially offset by a reduced burden on unemployment insurance. It makes more sense for the government to pay for people to be employed rather than unemployed. The plan has appropriate restrictions to cap salaries and pay raises. The Job Creators Network sent a letter, co-signed by 28 other small business groups, to Sens. Rubio and Collins supporting their approach. Another complementary solution that the Job Creators Network is exploring is an employer payroll tax holiday. Temporarily eliminating this tax would allow small businesses to avoid a major operational cost — 7.65 percent of each employee’s pay set aside every two weeks — to cover coronavirus-induced expenses. A 2010 study conducted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that an employer payroll tax cut significantly boosts employment and economic growth. A payroll tax holiday combined with a 90-day deferment of other taxes would boost the cash flow for small businesses, enabling some to cover their coronavirus-induced costs without resorting to the Rubio and Collins loan/grant program. These small business assistance measures are just the most pressing. Congress can pass a broader “Main Street Recovery Act” legislation later this year with additional provisions after the disease threat has abated. The Trump administration, Congress, and even the Federal Reserve are working in unison to help small businesses get through this crisis. They get it. They understand that small business is too big to fail. Alfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network.",Exclusive–Ortiz: Phase 3 Coronavirus Legislation Will Expand Government Response to Protect Small Businesses,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/exclusive-ortiz-phase-3-coronavirus-legislation-will-expand-government-response-to-protect-small-businesses%e2%80%a8/,Breitbart
"Actor John Cusack has told President Donald Trump to “rot in hell” after the commander in chief scolded an NBC News reporter during Friday’s White House press conference on the coronavirus pandemic. The High Fidelity star was reacting to a testy exchange between President Trump and NBC News White House correspondent Peter Alexander. Cusack, who is a Bernie Sanders supporter, tweeted out a clip of the conference, but the video didn’t include crucial parts of the exchange in which the reporter suggested that the president was deceiving the American people. “Rot in hell – mr president,” John Cusack said responding to a tweet posted by the far-left Pod Save America account. Rot in hell – mr president @PodSaveAmerica: Q: What do you say to Americans who are scared  TRUMP: “I say that you’re a terrible reporter, that’s what I say.”  Unreal. pic.twitter.com/SsmPJJcAfJ” — John Cusack (@johncusack) March 20, 2020  During the exchange, NBC News’ Peter Alexander suggested that President Trump was giving Americans false hope about the country’s response to the global pandemic. “It is possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope about our level of preparedness right now?” Alexander asked. “No I don’t think so. I don’t think so… such a lovely question,” President Trump answered, before continuing to talk about the malaria drug chloroquine, which some believe could be effective in treating COVID-19.  The reporter followed up by asking the president what he would say to Americans who are “scared” right now. “What do you say to Americans who are scared though?” Alexander continued. “I guess, nearly 200 dead, 14,000 who are sick, millions as you witnessed who are scared right now. What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?” President Trump replied: “I say that you’re a terrible reporter. That’s what I say. I think that’s a very nasty question, and I think that’s a very bad signal that you’re putting out to the American people.” The president continued: “The American people are looking for answers and they’re looking for hope. And you’re doing sensationalism, and the same with NBC and ‘Concast.’ I don’t call it ‘Comcast,’ I call it ‘Concast,’ for whom you work. Let me just tell you something: that’s really bad reporting. And you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism.” NBC News is a division of NBCUniversal, which is owned the Comcast. Far-left filmmaker Rob Reiner also weighed in on the exchange, tweeting that President Trump “exhibited severe mental instability and scared US all shitless.” When Trump was asked by NBC’s Peter Alexander what he would say to people who are scared right now, he exhibited his severe mental instability and scared US all shitless. — Rob Reiner (@robreiner) March 20, 2020  Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

"CLAIM: NBC News White House correspondent Peter Alexander claims he asked the president to calm Americans, and he lashed out. VERDICT: False. Alexander first asked whether the president was giving Americans “false hope.” Peter Alexander is attempting to defend himself after being called out by President Donald Trump on national television during a White House briefing on the coronavirus outbreak on Friday. Alexander claims that he was simply asking the president “to reassure Americans.” I offered both Pres Trump and VP Pence an opportunity to reassure Americans. Simple question: “What do you say to Americans who are scared?” Trump, to me: “I say, you’re a terrible reporter.” Pence, an hour later: “Don’t be afraid. Be vigilant.” — Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) March 20, 2020  That is not, in fact, what happened. Alexander was asking about the president’s effort to promote a drug, chloroquine, that is approved for other uses but that some say can mitigate the effects of the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the president’s team, said Friday that there was no clinical evidence yet of chloroquine’s positive effects, and that the evidence was anecdotal. Trump reiterated Friday that he was optimistic about chloroquine, largely because it had already been approved for other uses. “I am a man who comes from a very positive school. … And we’ll see how it works out, Peter. I’m not saying it will.” He added that if the drug did help, it would be a “game changer.” Alexander then pushed back, and the following exchange ensued. Alexander: Is it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope, and misrepresenting the preparedness right now — Trump: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think so. No, I don’t think so. I think — [Crosstalk] Alexander: The sale, not-yet-approved drug — Trump: Such a lovely question. Look. It may work, and it may not work. And I agree with the doctor, what he said.  May work, may not work. I feel good about it. That’s all it is. It’s just a feeling, right, you know? I’m a smart guy. I feel good about it. And we’re gonna see — you’re gonna see soon enough. And we have certainly some very big samples of people, if you look at the people, a lot of people that are in big trouble. And this is not a drug that obviously, I think I can speak from a lot of experience, because it’s been out there for over twenty years. So it’s not a drug that you have a huge amount of danger with, it’s not like a brand new drug that’s just been created that may t have have an unbelievable, monumental effect, like kill you. We’re gonna know very soon. And I can tell you, the FDA is working very hard to get it out. Right now, in terms of malaria, if you want it, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. And by the way — and it is very effective. It works. I have a feeling you may — and I am not being overly optimistic or pessimistic. I sure as hell think we ought to give it a try. I mean, there’s been been some interesting things happened, and some very good things. Let’s see what happens. We have nothing to lose. You know the expression, “What the hell do you have to lose?” Okay? Alexander: So what do you say — I’ll just follow up. So what do you say Americans who are scared, though? I guess — nearly 200 dead; 14,000 who are sick; millions, as you witnessed, who are scared right now, What do you say Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?  Trump: I say that you are a terrible reporter. That’s what I say. Go ahead. I think it’s a very nasty question, and I think it’s a very bad signal that you are putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers, and they’re looking for hope, and you’re doing sensationalism. And the same with NBC and Concast.  I don’t call it “Comcast,” I call it “Concast.” Let me just tell — [for] whom you work. Let me just tell you something. That’s really bad reporting. And you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism. Let’s see if it works. It might, and it might not. I happen to feel good about it. But who knows? I have been right a lot. Let’s see what happens. John? — You ought to be ashamed of yourself. The question about Americans being scared came after Alexander asked about giving Americans “false hope.” Trump tried to answer patiently, and finally vented his frustration once it seemed that Alexander was trying to emphasize fear, even after his question was answered. Alexander also contrasted Vice President Mike Pence’s answer with the president’s, as if to show that his question was reasonable, and to make Trump’s answer look bad by comparison. What Alexander’s tweet omits is that Pence’s answer are much later, after journalists had peppered the president and other officials with a barrage of questions about the president supposedly attacking the media. All of Trump’s aides, including the Pence, backed the president. Later, Alexander put out a statement in which he claimed to have been asking the president a “softball” question. He speculated that Trump was motivated by “anxiety” about “his political prospects,” and concluded with an attack: The bottom line is, this is a president whose experiences in life are very different than most Americans across this country right now. Not a person who likely worries about finances or had, not a person who in the course of his life is worried about his future, not a person who is worried about where to find a paycheck for his bills or for his rent and as evidenced by the president suggesting that an opportunity to provide for American some reassurance about how they should feel right now, the president instead took it out on me.

"China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, in a preview of an interview released on Friday, repudiated assertions that communist officials covered up the novel coronavirus outbreak in China at its early stages. In the preview of the interview by Axios that is scheduled to air on Sunday, the ambassador denied that Beijing withheld information that U.S. officials believe could have helped the rest of the world combat the disease and save lives. Cui’s comments came in response to Jonathan Swan from Axios pressing him about Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials “covering up” the outbreak in China, the birthplace of the disease, at its early stages. Health officials detected the first coronavirus case on November 17 in Wuhan, China. “By covering up the reality of this virus for three weeks, communist party officials allowed the virus to spread not just to Han people in China, but to people all around the world,” Swan noted. The Axios reporter then proceeded to ask the ambassador point-blank whether the communist party wanted to apologize for its initial “cover up” of the novel coronavirus infections (COVID-19) in China. “I think that that statement is based on distortions of fact,” Cui replied.

Tune in Sunday at 6pm ET/PT on all HBO platforms. pic.twitter.com/m0okzJKXs5 — Axios (@axios) March 20, 2020  During a March 11 event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien blasted Beijing for covering up the coronavirus outbreak in China at its early stages. Rather than using best practices during China’s early handling of the highly contagious and deadly disease, “this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,” O’Brien declared. “There’s lots of open source reporting from Chinese nationals that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation … so the word of this virus could not get out,” he added. If China had been cooperative at the beginning of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could have dramatically curtailed what happened in China and what’s now happening across the world,” O’Brien said. “It probably cost the world community two months to respond, and those two months … could have dramatically curtailed what happened in China and what is now happening across the world,” he also said. A study published last week by the University of Southampton’s WorldPop population mapping group determined that China could have prevented 95 percent of the coronavirus infections plaguing the globe if Beijing had listened to the doctors in Wuhan who blew the whistle on the seriousness of the disease instead of silencing and punishing them for speaking out. In an interview with CNBC earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also acknowledged that China had put the U.S. “behind the curve” in responding to the outbreak. “Remember, this is the Wuhan coronavirus that’s caused this, and the information that we got at the front end of this thing wasn’t perfect and has led us now to a place where much of the challenge we face today has put us behind the curve,” Pompeo told CNBC on March 6. A surge of pneumonia deaths in China that are not being counted as coronavirus has also sparked concerns that the Chinese Communist Party is continuing to cover up the extent of the Wuhan virus cases and artificially deflating numbers. On March 13, the U.S. government summoned Amb. Cui to the State Department to protest Beijing’s suggestion that the American military brought the coronavirus to China. The Trump administration has pushed back against China’s propaganda effort to reframe the coronavirus outbreak as a triumph for communism now that new cases in the country have allegedly begun to drop. WHO deemed the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.

That is also the position of congressional Democrats — and some Republicans — who want assurances that corporations will use government bailout funds to support workers, not bolster their earnings reports. Trump told reporters, “Well, we don’t want that.” He added, “People are coming in for money, in some cases through no fault of their own, but in some cases where they did certain things over the course of the years, including buying back stock.” On Friday, Biden wrote on Twitter that CEOs should “commit now to not buying back their company’s stock over the course of the next year.” I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year.

"Laid-off staffers of former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign were alerted that they were exposed to the deadly Chinese coronavirus, according to a report. Per Politico: On Friday morning, the campaign then laid off hundreds of staffers across the country, including at least several dozen in the New York office who are potentially at risk and are now being asked to finish their employment working from home. While staffers in battleground states have health coverage until the end of April, the dismissed Bloomberg employees in the New York City headquarters will lose health insurance after March 31. In an email sent at 11:03 pm Thursday, with the mundane subject line “Building Update – 229 West 43rd Street,” the campaign’s human resources department wrote: “We’ve just become aware of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the office at 229 West 43rd Street impacting the 5th and 8th floor.” The campaign wrote that the individual was last in the office on Monday, March 1. The campaign recommended employees work from home for the next two weeks, spurring panic among some staffers given their health insurance will end in just 11 days. Bloomberg staffers are now speaking out about potential contact with the coronavirus, expressing worry that the newly-unemployed could find themselves buried in medical debt if they become hospitalized for the deadly illness. “Think about the potential of someone getting hospitalized on April 1, without coverage, fighting for their life and now being strapped with massive medical debt,” one unnamed Bloomberg campaign alum told Politico. “The campaign’s refusal to extend health care benefits is unconscionable and putting people at grave risk. This is not how you treat people who sacrificed a lot to work for you.” “I guess it’s cheaper to give the DNC $18 million than keep promises because @MikeBloomberg just fired his whole campaign staff — including those of us promised jobs though November on his IE,” Amol Jethwani, a former Bloomberg advisor, tweeted, “Disappointed I don’t have a job. Not surprised that a billionaire is cheating scum.” Politico’s report comes hours after Bloomberg transferred $18 million from his campaign to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in what is the largest transfer of its king ever. It’s the latest sign of the billionaire businessman’s continued involvement in the race since ending his own campaign this month due to a lackluster showing in the March 3 primaries. In those Super Tuesday contests, the former New York City mayor won only one U.S. territory. Bloomberg’s contribution amounts to more than the national party’s typical cash balance. The transfer will help the DNC make up for some of the steep fundraising disadvantage when compared with its Republican counterpart, which routinely has raised tens of millions more than the Democratic organization throughout election cycles. One of the world’s wealthiest men with a net worth estimated to exceed $60 billion, Bloomberg promised throughout his campaign that he would help Democrats try to defeat President Donald Trump regardless of how his own White House bid fared. The Bloomberg campaign, which hired a staff of 2,400 people across 43 states, will also transfer its offices in six pivotal states to the Democratic parties in those states, to help accelerate their hiring and organizing. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

"Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said Friday his Republican colleague in the Senate, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) “owes North Carolinians an explanation” for allegations he engaged in insider training after receiving classified briefings on the Coronavirus pandemic. Given the circumstances, Senator Burr owes North Carolinians an explanation. His self-referral to the Ethics Committee for their review is appropriate, there needs to be a professional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter, which the Ethics Committee can provide. (1/2) — Senator Thom Tillis (@SenThomTillis) March 20, 2020  Rarely does a state’s junior senator publicly call out that state’s senior senator, especially when both are members of the same political party. Tillis was elected in 2014, and is up for re-election in 2020. First elected in 2004, Burr is up for re-election in 2022. Two polls of the 2020 North Carolina Senate race between Tillis and likely Democrat challenger Cal Cunningham conducted in February show the contest is very close. An East Carolina University Poll shows Tillis with a 2 point lead, while an NBC News/Marist College Polls shows Cunningham with a 5 point lead. Tillis’s tweet came shortly after Burr requested earlier in the day that the Senate Ethics Committee initiate an investigation into allegations that he engaged in insider trading based upon information provided to him in classified briefings on the Coronavirus pandemic. “I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13,” Burr said in a statement posted in on his Twitter account Friday morning. “Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” the statement concluded. My statement in response to reports about recent financial disclosures: pic.twitter.com/J4kye5a4ok — Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 20, 2020  Burr’s request for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation came after press reports on Thursday that he and three other U.S. Senators — Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), and Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK)–sold millions of dollars in their stock portfolio shortly before the stock market plunged but after they received classified briefings on the status of the Coronavirus pandemic. As Breitbart News reported: Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) unloaded upwards of $1.56 million in stock after receiving confidential briefings regarding the outbreak of the Coronavirus. Burr, who is the senior senator from North Carolina and plans to retire in 2022, dumped thousand of dollars worth of stock on Feb. 13—less than a week before the stock market sharply dropped because of the coronavirus pandemic. The senator’s timely decision to sell, which was first reported by ProPublica, netted him between over $580,000 and $1.56 million. Much of those shares are now worth a fraction of their price when Burr opted to sell. For instance, the prior investment Burr had in Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, which was worth upwards of $150,000, is now valued at two-thirds that price. Similarly, the nearly $100,000 worth of stock in Extended Stay America that Burr disposed of in February is now estimated to be worth over 50 percent less. Those transactions, 29 in total, that Burr conducted came as the intelligence committee was receiving daily briefings on the spread of the coronavirus. During February, in particular, Burr and his colleagues on Capitol Hill were closely monitoring the situation unfolding. On his Fox News Channel program Thursday night, Tucker Carlson singled out Burr and called on him to resign: “You may have seen news reports this afternoon that chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee sold more than a million dollars in stock in mid-February after learning about how devastating the Chinese coronavirus could be. He had inside information about what could happen to our country, which is now happening,” Carlson said. “But he didn’t warn the public. He didn’t give a primetime address. He didn’t go on television to sound the alarm. He didn’t even disavow an op-ed he’d written just 10 days before claiming America was “better prepared than ever for coronavirus.” “He didn’t do any of those things,” he continued. “Instead, what did he do? He dumped his shares in hotel stocks so he wouldn’t lose money, and then he stayed silent. Maybe there is an honest explanation for what he did. If there is, he should share it with the rest of us immediately. Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate and face prosecution for insider trading. There is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time crisis, and that appears to be what happened.” Sen. James Lanford (R-OK), chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, had not yet commented publicly on Burr’s request as of late Friday morning, The New York Post reported at noon ET Friday and The Hill reported at 11:00 a.m. ET Friday.",Thom Tillis: Sen.

"Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn told his students and their parents in a video message that this unprecedented period of time in America is a “test of character and intellect of the kind that shapes human souls and portrays them in their excellence.” Arnn delivered his video message Friday as Hillsdale students move to online classes Monday due to the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated in China: Why character? Well, it’ll be easy, won’t it? To sink into some kind of lassitude while you’re away: Not everybody’s here; you don’t see people in person; there are plenty of distractions. And yet it’s true that nobody ever learned any serious thing except by intensity. You’ve got to work hard. Everybody does, every minute, to know any great or important thing, any serious thing, it always requires that. Arnn continued about the radical changes that have occurred in a short time within the country: Everything is in motion. The stock market’s never fallen as far or as fast as it’s fallen. I don’t know that we’ve ever attempted to suspend the work in great countries for months at a time in time of peace. In fact, never in war for that matter. We’re trying radical new things, and it looks like there aren’t any rules, but there’s something to notice in the middle of all that. … These events in society, how are we to understand them? It raises the whole question, “What is the purpose of life? Is it just to live? Is it to live well? What does ‘living well’ take? What requirements are there in this radical situation?” Arnn said the questions the current crisis raises are “exactly what Hillsdale College was founded to think about”: That is it’s activity. That’s what it does. And now it gets to do it in a new way, under some adversity. So, the test of character, it’s not heightened—because college itself, as is every difficult thing that is a test of character, and a formation of character, too—but it’s a new kind of test. Because it’s a shameful thing to waste a day of your life, especially if you’re young and talented. Because what you do today will affect all the days to come, and you have many to come. Hillsdale’s website identifies the school as an independent, nonsectarian Christian institution founded in 1844. The college accepts no federal taxpayer funding, and any financial aid that is extended is through private contributions. Arnn explained to Hillsdale students in his video message that, regardless of whether they are present in person or having classes online, “we are going to use this time to the maximum effect.” “And then the minute I can justify a decision to come back, I will invite you all back with great joy and pleasure,” he added. “In the meantime, get ready for Monday. Get your boots on. Let’s have a great term.”",Watch – Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn: This Time in America a ‘Test of Character and Intellect’,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/watch-hillsdale-college-president-larry-arnn-this-time-in-america-a-test-of-character-and-intellect/,Breitbart
"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a “stay-at-home” order for the entire state which will take effect on Saturday, announcing the policy in a press conference Friday afternoon. The governor decreed the order as part of the state’s widespread efforts to curb the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus during a press conference Friday afternoon, alongside Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. According to the Chicago Tribune, the order will not result in the mass closure of roads and would still allow residents to “go to the grocery stores, put gas in their cars, take walks outside and make pharmacy runs.” The news comes as leaders in other states begin to take more aggressive action on a statewide level to combat the spread of the virus. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday announced a stay-at-home order for the state’s 40 million residents: Governor @GavinNewsom issued a stay at home order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians and to establish consistency across the state in order to slow the spread of #COVID19.

"The Navy is deploying two massive hospital ships to treat non-coronavirus patients to help alleviate a potential strain on civilian hospitals located near coastal areas, likely in New York and Washington state. The USNS Comfort, which is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia, and was undergoing maintenance, will be ready to deploy in early April. The USNS Mercy, home-ported in San Diego, California, will be ready to deploy in days, Navy officials said. “Both ships are currently working to complete scheduled maintenance cycles and identify necessary medical staffing to deploy as soon as possible,” said Thomas Van Leunen, spokesman for Military Sealift Command, the command in charge of the ships when they are not activated. The ships will likely dock in one place, near coastal areas that could be overwhelmed with coronavirus-related hospitalizations and need extra capacity. Since the ships are primarily designed to treat trauma cases, they will not take patients with the novel coronavirus but will treat other patients who are either currently hospitalized or those who will need hospitalization in the future. “The Comfort and Mercy will not deploy to treat COVID patients but will be made available to assist with treatment of other patients in coastal locations where local health professionals are necessarily focused on a large number of COVID cases,” Van Leunen added. The ships, which are unarmed, have 1,000 hospital beds. That includes: They also have: They can also carry 3,000 units of frozen blood and 2,000 units of fresh blood. On full operating status, the ships can hold up to 1,215 medical staff and 67 civilian crew members. They are equipped with the following surgical capabilities: invasive angiography/CT Scan, interventional radiography, anesthesiology, ear/nose/throat, maxillofacial, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedic, urology, cardio-thoracic, general surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, and plastic/reconstructive. Non-surgical capabilities include: angiography, dental, family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, dialysis, dermatology, intensive care, and neurology. They are typically used to support military operations and treat combat casualties, as well as for humanitarian and disaster relief missions abroad and at home. The Comfort also aided in relief operations after 9/11. The Navy has already begun calling up medical personnel to staff the ships for the coronavirus-response mission. For the Comfort, much of its medical crew is expected to come from Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. Navy officials say that so far, no U.S. sailor on a ship has tested positive for coronavirus, and they have policies in place to screen patients and crew coming on board to prevent the spread of coronavirus onto the ships. “We have a protocol not only for any patient that would come aboard but for all of the crew. So before the critical core reported today, they were all screened before they crossed the bow of the ship,” he said. “The remainder of the crew as they come aboard will also be similarly screened. And then we’ll be very careful in the development of our concept of operations of how to care for community patients. Screening will be an essential part of that guidance,” he said.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",U.S. Navy Hospital Ships Soon to Deploy on Coronavirus Support Missions,2020-03-20,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/20/u-s-navy-hospital-ships-soon-to-deploy-on-coronavirus-support-missions/,Breitbart
"The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) says that the “stricter” social distancing measures would need to be in place half of the year in order to stop the NHS being overwhelmed with Chinese coronavirus cases. The paper, dated from Monday but released on Friday, said that the consensus view of the scientists was that “the addition of both general social distancing and school closures to case isolation, household isolation, and social distancing of vulnerable groups would be likely to control the epidemic when kept in place for a long period”. The SAGE note added that “a policy of alternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures could plausibly be effective at keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity. “These would need to be in place for at least most of a year. Under such as policy, at least half of the year would be spent under the stricter social distancing measures.” With such measures, SAGE adds, it would take two to three weeks for the alleviative effect to be felt in hospitals’ intensive care units (ICUs). Strict measures include social distancing for everyone, regardless of the appearance of health, and closing schools. Less strict measures would mean isolation of households and social distancing for vulnerable groups like senior citizens and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Report: Overwhelmed London Hospitals Turning Away Coronavirus Patients https://t.co/t0phaqMSXM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  The prospect of some kind of social distancing measures being in place for much of the year comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that “we can turn the tide” on coronavirus “within the next 12 weeks”. “But only if we all take the steps that we’ve outlined – that is vital,” Mr Johnson said. Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist from the University of Reading, told Sky News on Friday that the 12-week remarks are valid “if everything goes to plan”, which also relies on everyone following social distancing advice. The microbiologist predicted that going into the autumn, and possibly the winter, there will be “some more spiking, some more bumps along the road where, possibly, you’ll see the reintroduction of measures.” “This is by no means the end of the road. We’ll still be looking at this, I think, into early next year, at least,” Dr Clarke said. The Reading academic said that that does not mean complete lockdown for the whole year, predicting: “It will mean a series of measures, maybe lighter, maybe stricter, than we have now. You’ll see it switched on and off. It might be done on a regional or local basis.” The regional measures suggested by Dr Clarke are in line with recommendations in the SAGE briefing paper, which notes that special measures could be arranged regionally. London could be a region subject to stricter measures, with the capital becoming the infection hotspot for the United Kingdom. It has been warned that people are failing to abide by currently advisory recommendations to self-isolate. A report claims that one London hospital trust has already had to turn away coronavirus patients, referring them to other hospitals because they do not have the capacity.

"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A popular Warsaw entertainment centre looks empty and closed amid a government-ordered shutdown from the coronavirus, but inside, cook Bozena Legowska is busy. One hot pizza after another is lifted out of the oven, boxed and whisked to a nearby hospital for a hungry staff of doctors who are working harder than ever under the pressure of the spreading virus. The pizza boxes are inscribed with upbeat messages, including, “You are our heroes.” The Ale Zebra centre in northern Warsaw has joined a growing nationwide network of restaurants and eateries showing their appreciation for the doctors, nurses and other medical professionals by bringing them free meals. Last week, the government imposed a “national quarantine” that closed schools, universities, restaurants and culture centres, asking everyone to stay home if possible. But that order doesn’t apply to health care workers, who face a time of incessant, intensified effort. A nation of 38 million, Poland has 378 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections. Five of the patients have died. Report: Overwhelmed London Hospitals Turning Away Coronavirus Patients https://t.co/t0phaqMSXM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  That has prompted #gastropomaga — “Gastronomy is helping” — and similar actions on social media to alleviate at least some of the worries for hospital workers who have no time to get a tasty meal. “At least the doctors don’t go hungry or worry where and how to get food,” said Iwona Sobczak, a secretary at the rescue ward of the Bielany Hospital, as she came out into the parking lot to collect the 10 offered pizzas. While those infected with the coronavirus are being treated at another facility, the Bielany Hospital is under greater pressure than usual as other patients are transferred there. Other messages on the pizza boxes for the doctors read: “We are with you” and “Zebra is helping.” Maciej Kolacinski, the host-manager at Ale Zebra, said the “feeling of joy one has when doing something good for the others is hard to describe.” His usually bustling Ale Zebra club caters to all ages with its pizza parlour that can host a party for 120 people, and features laser tag, billiards, slot machines and even an “Escape Room” where players are locked in and must hunt for clues to try to find a way out. It’s all empty and quiet now. Hand disinfectants are next to a washbasin and on the counter. A customer collects his order of two pizzas through a small window from the outside and pays with a touch card. “Our financial situation is not a comfortable one,” Kolacinski said. “We are making no money, but this is true for everyone now. We are trying to do something positive.” On March 11, the government announced a “shield program” worth 212 billion zlotys ($52 billion; 47 billion euros) for businesses hit by the pandemic. The bailout includes state contributions to wages, postponement of social insurance payments and an injection of cash for infrastructure and education investments. The “meals for medics” campaign has been joined by many others in Warsaw. London Hospital Declares ‘Critical Incident’ over Coronavirus, Not Enough Spaces for Patients https://t.co/LjWElpsjZf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  The Indian Taste restaurant is among those delivering food to the contagious diseases hospital on Wolska street, where coronavirus patients are treated. One of the deliverymen wearing a scarf across his face carried a container of spicy food with lots of garlic and ginger. “I live nearby. Maybe I also catch the virus and I will have to be hospitalized here,” he told the OKO.press independent news portal in a video interview. The campaign to provide free food for medics began last week in the eastern city of Bialystok and has spread nationwide. Magdalena Rothe, owner of the Futu Sushi bar in Bialystok, was among the first to call hospitals to ask how she can help. Now a group of restaurants and bakeries have organized a schedule of deliveries to hospitals to avoid overlapping. “We will not feed the entire hospital, but those 15 meals will allow the doctors to sit down for a while and eat something,” Rothe told The Associated Press by phone. “It is a spontaneous gesture of thanks for their very stressful work these days.” In other acts of social solidarity during an uncertain time in Poland, people are posting notices for elderly neighbours, offering to go shopping or walk their dogs so the vulnerable can stay home and isolate themselves from infection. An ambulance station that is on the front line of the virus crisis was another recipient of the free pizzas from Ale Zebra.

"While the Turkish government has closed its border to Greece due to the Coronavirus, migrants are still attempting to storm the border using improvised ladders. Footage of the migrants along the Greek border near the Evros river showed them building makeshift ladders using tree trunks and tree branches in order to scale the Greek border fence, which has largely kept out the large numbers of migrants who have assembled in the area. The video footage of the migrants circulating on social media was sourced to a report by Greek media outlet Proto Thema, which in turn stated that Turkish media had first published the recordings. The paper added that the attempts by the migrants to cross the border near Kastanias were not successful as Greek border officials, supported by the European Union border agency Frontex, were able to repel them.

Chrisochoidis stated that most of the families and elderly who had previously been at the frontier had left following the Turkish move to close the border due to fears of spreading coronavirus. Chrisochoidis also went on to accuse Turkish forces of throwing tear gas toward the Greek border, a situation which saw the Greeks end up deploying large fans in the area to blow the gas back. “In Europe, they did not believe that Greece would withstand this border attack, they were pleasantly surprised by our resistance,” he added. Following Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s move to open the border to Europe in late February, Greek authorities have said that over 50,000 migrants attempted to break into Greece, with 410 being arrested.

"During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-OR) stated that Democrats won’t support relief for corporations unless it comes with conditions that “any relief goes first to paying workers and protecting their benefits,” in addition to “capping corporate pay, prohibiting bonuses and golden parachutes for CEOs.” And “making certain workers and everyday Americans have a seat at the table where important business decisions are being made so Main Street’s interests are fully considered – not just Wall Street’s.” Transcript as Follows: “Hi, I’m Congressman Peter DeFazio. I represent the 4th District of Oregon and serve as Chair of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. There’s no question we are in an unprecedented moment and fighting an unprecedented foe – COVID-19. People are worried about their health and that of their loved ones; the stability of their personal finances and the future of our economy. It’s important to remember we are all in this together. Right now, Americans are working at every level, around the clock, to make sure we get through this crisis and that we take care of each other. I see many acts of kindness and compassion in my communities in Oregon every day. Health care workers and first responders are working incredibly hard and sacrificing so much to treat and protect patients. School districts are stepping up to make sure students can get ‘grab and go’ meals. Neighbors are helping neighbors get the food and supplies they need. One car dealership in my district is providing drivers to deliver meals and groceries to senior citizens and others with limited mobility. And a local distillery started making hand sanitizer for the community for free. That’s so important because at the end of the day, putting people first is how we get back on our feet. That’s why Democrats are fighting For The People – to ensure that workers, families and students come first ­­– that they are at the core of any piece of emergency legislation coming from this Congress to address this crisis. In a matter of days, Congress has passed two bills that put families first, providing funding to jump-start the development of a vaccine; assist states with response; manufacturing and distributing needed medical supplies, and help people get food, paid sick leave and more. One of our next priorities must be providing badly-needed relief to keep goods and essential workers moving – something I’m focused on right now. There’s virtually no aspect of the transportation sector and the tens of millions of jobs it supports, that hasn’t been hurt by this sudden change. As we adjust to a new reality, for now, of staying close to home, ridership on our public transit systems, commuter rail, Amtrak and airlines has plummeted – nearly zeroing out revenue streams. But here’s the thing: transportation will always be critical to our nation – especially right now. We need to make sure medical professionals can get to work. That the critical medical supplies they need are delivered urgently and responsibly. That the grocery store employee – who’s working hard to keep the shelves stocked at your local store– has a way to work. We need to make sure truck drivers and airplanes can move the cargo that so many people need right now, from prescriptions, to toiletries, to food and critical medical supplies and canned goods. We will get through this pandemic stronger than ever. I am committed to making sure we keep our country running in the short-term and to position ourselves for a strong and speedy recovery fueled by the investments we need to build a 21st century transportation system and provide millions of jobs. So, Congress is having intense discussions about the best path forward right now to keep all parts of our transportation system moving. And one thing is certain: we cannot repeat the mistakes Congress made in the wake of 9/11 or 2008, when the federal government awarded big corporations virtually no-strings-attached-relief. The results for corporate interests were great, while working families were largely left behind. So, Democrats won’t support relief for corporations unless it comes with strict guardrails that ensure American workers get taken care of first. That means any relief goes first to paying workers and protecting their benefits, like health insurance and retirement accounts – not stock buybacks, not executive giveaways, not layoffs. That means capping corporate pay, prohibiting bonuses and golden parachutes for CEOs. That means making certain workers and everyday Americans have a seat at the table where important business decisions are being made so Main Street’s interests are fully considered – not just Wall Street’s. We can’t forget that most workers are the most valuable and important asset to a business of any size. Of course transportation is just part of the equation, and rest assured, I and my fellow Democratic colleagues in Congress are working hard to get relief to people who lose their jobs, small businesses that have been shuttered and those who are struggling to make ends meet. This is an unprecedented crisis. It will have lasting impacts on society. But I know that when faced with a national crisis, Americans rise to the challenge. We already see it in our communities, and I know that together, we can come out of this safer, stronger and more unified than before. In the meantime, I urge everyone to heed guidance from the CDC and your state and local public health officials. Wash your hands. Stay home if you’re sick, practice social distancing, don’t buy more supplies than you need and if your community is advised to shelter in place, understand that experts are making that difficult call only because it’s absolutely necessary to protect you and your fellow citizens.

"During a coronavirus roundtable on Friday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) criticized the Republican coronavirus relief proposal, stating that it helps out large corporations and the wealthy, “while providing little to no assistance to the people most in need.” Sanders said, “The Republican proposal provides massive tax breaks and subsidies to the wealthy and very large corporations while providing little to no assistance to the people most in need.

"An ambassador from China is lauding Hillary Clinton’s recent attack on President Trump. “The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis,” Clinton wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “Don’t fall for it. Don’t let your friends and family fall for it.” The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis.  Don't fall for it.

He shared a tweet from China News Service, a regime-owned agency: It is true.  Justice always speak loudly. https://t.co/kZjcYccFPg — Chinese Ambassador to South Africa (@AmbLINSongtian) March 20, 2020  The attached article listed several Americans, namely Clinton and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), criticizing Trump for blaming China. “It is true,” Lin wrote regarding Clinton’s attack that Trump calling coronavirus a “Chinese virus” is “racist rhetoric.” “Justice always speak [sic] loudly.” Clinton has repeatedly taken potshots at Trump during the coronavirus crisis. “Hospitals are already running out of ventilators and beds. Nurses are using bandanas as masks,” she typed on Thursday. “If you’ve already ordered more with the Defense Production Act, tell us now,” she demanded. Let’s try this again, @realdonaldtrump: Hospitals are already running out of ventilators and beds. Nurses are using bandanas as masks.

That was an action Trump took the prior day. NPR reported: The law contains a section that authorizes the president to control the production and distribution of scarce materials deemed “essential to the national defense.” In his executive order, Trump specifically cites protective equipment (presumably face masks) and ventilators as meeting the criteria in this provision. On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence said, “We’ve extended the liability protection so now all the industrial masks that are manufactured as N95s are now available to hospitals, and we’re seeing a dramatic increase in production.” He added, “Honeywell alone is repurposing a factory that was destined for Mexico to produce another 120 million masks per year. 3M is increasing output to 420 million masks per year.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"The super PAC that tried to bolster Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) floundering presidential campaign had the backing of wealthy Silicon Valley doctor and Democrat megadonor Karla Jurvetson, Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings reveal. Jurvetson, who has been heavily involved in supporting Democrat candidates and causes, largely backed the PAC that spent millions in favor of Warren ahead of Super Tuesday. While Warren has lamented the role of big donors in politics, Jarvestson reportedly provided the bulk of the PAC’s resources through a $14.6 donation in February, according to FEC filings. They show the doctor giving the monstrous donation to the Persist PAC — the same PAC that dumped millions into the effort to revive Warren’s floundering campaign following her losses in Iowa and New Hampshire. According to Politico: Jurvetson is one of the biggest donors in the Democratic Party and has spoken openly about what she feels is her obligation to support female candidates. “I feel like it’s our moral duty, if we’re not going to run ourselves, to support the women who are brave enough to put their name on the ballot,” she told the Mercury News in 2018. Jurvetson also hosted a fundraising luncheon for Warren in 2018 — before the Massachusetts senator disavowed in-person fundraising events altogether during her presidential run. Through a spokesperson, Jurvetson declined to comment on her involvement in Persist PAC, which only collected a half-million dollars from other sources in February, according to a new campaign finance filing. Warren did not respond to a request for comment. Jurvetson also made waves in July after assisting Warren’s campaign in gaining access to the Democrat Party’s voter database — a resource that came at a $175,000 price tag. Warren’s campaign, at the time, claimed the assistance did not break her stance to refuse help from wealthy donors. “However, Warren’s team said she did not break her promise, as she did not personally reach out to Jurvetson, fundraise with her, or grant her special access,” Breitbart News reported at the time. While Warren has called for the end of big money in politics, she refused to commit to refusing support from super PACs in her own bid, contending that all candidates should make that pledge together. “The first day I got in this race over a year ago, I said I hope every presidential candidate who comes in will agree no super PACs for any of us. I renewed that call dozens of times, and I couldn’t get a single Democrat to go along with me,” Warren told reporters in February: NEW: Here is video of Warren declining to disavow the new super PAC supporting her: “If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACs, count me in.

"President Trump said American businesses are actively stepping to help combat the coronavirus by changing their factories over to making goods and equipment needed by health care workers. On Friday, President Donald Trump announced that he invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, which allows the government to marshal the private sector to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. But on Saturday, Trump said he has not had to use those powers because so many companies are voluntarily repurposing their facilities. “We have so many companies making so many products,” Trump said. “We have the act to use in case we need it, but we have so many things being made right now by so many — they’ve just stepped up.” Mr. Trump said that Hanes is converting manufacturing capabilities to produce protective masks. Distilleries are switching from making alcoholic drinks like whiskey to making sanitizers and disinfectants. Automakers, including General Motors, are retrofitting plants to make ventilators. All are answering the call of duty amid a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 11,000 lives and sickened 260,000 people globally. Redirecting plants to make completely different products take a huge effort — but companies are moving much faster than was previously thought possible.. At a news conference earlier this week, Trump singled out GM — which in 1952 designed and built what the company says was the first mechanical pump used in heart surgery — as one of many businesses that have asked to start making medical gear. “We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that wanted to do the work,” he said. “They want to help our country.” GM announced on Friday that it is working with ventilator maker Ventec Life Systems to ramp up production. The automaker said it would help with logistics, purchasing and manufacturing, but stopped short of saying it would make ventilators in its own factories, which have been idled for two weeks after workers who’d been fearful of contagion put pressure on the company. Crosstown rival Ford, which also suspended factory production along with other automakers with operations in North America, confirmed that it too was in discussions with the Trump administration about helping. “We’re looking at feasibility,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said. “It may be possible, but it’s not you go from Rangers (small pickups) one day to ventilators the next. We’re figuring out what is possible now.” Ford and Rolls-Royce PLC also are working with the British government to see if they can switch over their factories. “We are keen to do whatever we can to help the government and the country at this time and will look to provide any practical help we can,” Rolls-Royce said in a statement. Rum producer Bacardi, for example, said its distillery in Puerto Rico has shifted to making ethanol needed to produce hand sanitizer. Small U.S. distilleries such as Eight Oaks Farm in Pennsylvania are converting operations to make alcohol-based disinfectant. It will charge whatever people want to donate. Germany-based Beiersdorf, known for skin care products such as the Nivea and Coppertone brands, and Luxury giant LVMH are preparing to make medical disinfectants in Europe for hospitals, police and firefighters. French cosmetics giant L’Oreal says it is making sanitizer gel. Electronics maker Sharp Corp. said it will start making surgical masks using a plant in central Japan that usually makes displays. And Michigan-based office furniture company Steelcase is exploring ways to use its factories to make health care items, studying whether it can make masks and protective equipment or partitions for hospitals. “This is an extraordinary crisis that necessitates extraordinary measures and actions from both the public and private sectors,” the company said in a statement. –The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Trump Praises American Private Sector For Stepping Up to Fight Coronavirus,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/21/private-sector-fights-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"The coronavirus has claimed the lives of over thirteen hundred people in Spain, but the country’s Health Minister says “the worst days are on their way”. As of Saturday, the number of confirmed cases of Chinese coronavirus in Spain has reached nearly 25,000, with 1,350 people dying from the killer virus. Spain now only trails behind China and Italy in the number of people infected. Madrid, the epicentre of the outbreak in the country, has been the hardest hit, with 176 people dying in a 24-hour span and 804 overall deaths since the virus reached Spanish shores. The government has taken over the Ifema convention centre, converting into a temporary field hospital that will be able to up to house 5,500 patients. Two hotels in the city have also been converted into makeshift hospitals to hold patients displaying mild symptoms of the coronavirus, El Pais reports. On Friday, Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa warned that “the worst days are on their way” despite the nation-wide lockdown enacted by the government. Fernando Simón, the director of the Health Ministry’s Co-ordination Center for Health Alerts, admitted that “it is very likely” that the rate of infection in Spain is much higher than the reported numbers, as testing kits have been in short supply. Rapid test kits were supposed to made available by the end of this week, however, the Health Ministry has refused to report how many tests are available, only saying that they will be available “in the coming days”. Coronavirus: Spain Limits Public Movement, Shuts Down Bars, Restaurants, Hotels, and More https://t.co/bLXPTl34Kw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  The president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, said on Thursday that it is likely that up to 80 per cent of the city will become infected with the coronavirus. “This virus has been in Spain for a longer time and is going to spread to practically everyone, and most people will not have a major problem, but the problem is the vulnerable population,” she said in comments reported by El Periodico. “In recent weeks the numbers of infected have increased in Madrid, it is like when we had the Spanish flu a century ago, in which Spain was the only country that gave real figures, because now it has happened in Madrid, which is where we started to quantify the number of infections,” Ayuso added. The rapidly rising number of infections in Spain has placed increasing strains on the nation’s healthcare system, leading the government to recruit medical students, retired doctors, and first aid volunteers to help with staff shortages. “It is really tough. Yesterday there was a queue to deal with seriously ill patients. Those who don’t make it die apart from their families,” a doctor in Barcelona told The Telegraph. Spain enacted a nation-wide lockdown to confront the spread of the virus last Saturday, in which people can only leave their homes for allowed purposes such as buying food and seeking medical care. The police and army have been patrolling the streets to implement the restrictions and have arrested 88 people for breaking the national quarantine. Neighbors under coronavirus lockdown surprised an 80-year-old woman on her birthday by singing ""Happy Birthday"" from their homes. https://t.co/d3t4HF3dZW — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 20, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka","Coronavirus Deaths Soar in Spain, 1,350 Dead and 25,000 Infected",2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/21/coronavirus-deaths-soar-in-spain-1350-dead-and-25000-infected/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump on Saturday said that companies accepting rescue funds from the U.S. government should not be allowed to buy back shares. “I am strongly recommending a buyback exclusion. You cannot buy back your stock,” Mr. Trump said at a press conference Saturday afternoon. The Senate is currently crafting a bill to provide the economy with rescue funds, including hundreds of billions of dollars of money intended to help companies avoid laying off workers during the coronavirus crisis. Many companies and industry groups have said they government assistance to make it through this era of massive shutdowns without widespread layoffs and bankruptcies. The rescue funds are likely to come with various strings attached, such as prohibitions on buybacks or dividend payments that would last at least until the government assistance is paid back. Some on Capitol Hill, including Massachusetts Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, have argued that the buyback prohibitions should be made permanent. Many economists, however, have warned against making the conditions for taking rescue funds too punitive. Executives at some companies would likely choose to layoff workers and even risk bankruptcy rather than accept permanent restrictions on capital distributions or give up operational control or board seats to the government. That would undermine the goal of supporting ongoing unemployment and minimizing disruptions. President Trump did not make it clear how long he believes restrictions on buybacks would last, although his comments appeared to contemplate them lasting only as long as government funding remains outstanding. ‘This time I’m saying, ‘You’re not doing that.’ I don’t want money to be used for that. I want money to be used for workers and for opening businesses, keeping businesses open.

"The majority of Americans are increasingly approving of how President Trump is handling the coronavirus pandemic, a Morning Consult poll released Friday revealed. The poll, taken March 17-20, 2020, among “roughly” 2,000 voters found that the majority of Americans approve of the way the president is handling the coronavirus pandemic — 53 approving and 39 percent disapproving. That, according to Morning Consult, “marks an increase of 10 percentage points in net approval of his coronavirus response since polling conducted March 13-16.” Additionally, the rise in approval does not just stem from Republicans. The survey found that the increase was “largely driven by 8-point bumps in approval among Democrats (from 18 percent to 26 percent) and independents (from 43 percent to 51 percent), while positive sentiment among GOP voters rose from 83 percent to 87 percent.” Morning Consult’s findings coincide with the trend displayed in a Harris poll released Thursday, which showed Trump’s approval, in terms of “handling” the pandemic, jumping five points, 51 percent to 56 percent, in less than a week. An ABC/Ipsos survey released on Friday also showed 55 percent of Americans approving of the president’s management of the crisis, up from 43 percent who approved last week. President Trump’s coronavirus task force has been holding daily briefings on the crisis, and the White House has been working with Congress to address the economic ramifications of the crisis, including cash payments to Americans. “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” Trump wrote ahead of Saturday’s 12:30 p.m. briefing alongside the coronavirus task force. “The FDA has moved mountains – Thank You!

"Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) released an aggressive plan on Friday–a “30-day plan to help get America back to normal” in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It includes the shutdown of international and domestic air travel, the closure of U.S. borders, a moratorium on all mortgages and utilities, and rigorous quarantine enforcements for individuals who have tested positive for the virus. The Florida senator highlighted eight aggressive policy proposals he believes the U.S. needs to embrace to quickly and adequately address the coronavirus crisis head-on. “Americans are scared because of the uncertainty the Coronavirus has brought. Small businesses are closing, people feel isolated and there’s no end in sight. But we can beat this,” Scott said in a statement. “There are a series of steps we can take right now that, if everyone cooperates, can end the spread of the Coronavirus in the U.S. If we take these actions, we can significantly stop the spread of the virus and return to our normal, daily lives,” he added. While some of his proposals, like encouraging everyone to “stay home to the extent possible,” have already been embraced by officials in other states, Scott is also pushing more drastic measures nationally, such as mandatory temperature checks for individuals entering public buildings, a moratorium on financial obligations like mortgage payments and rent, and the suspension of air travel. Per his press release: Scott previously called for proper social distancing measures and the closure of U.S. borders, telling Fox News on Monday, “We’re either going to go the path of South Korea or we’re going to go the path of Italy.” “I think we’re going to go the path of South Korea because we have to get this testing up this week.

"A federal judge in Seattle rejected three nonprofits’ effort to force U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to release migrants in a detention center in Washington state because of the threat from coronavirus. U.S. District Judge James L. Robart on Thursday denied a request for a restraining order requested by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of Washington, and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The organizations argued that holding migrants who are older or have underlying medical conditions puts them at high risk for contracting the virus. “There is no evidence that anyone at NWDC has COVID-19, and plaintiffs do not address the measures defendants are taking to prevent such a spread from occurring,” Robart said in a Law360 article on the development. Law360 reported on the ruling: Attorneys have told Law360 that they are concerned ICE is not prepared to handle a potential outbreak of the virus at the agency’s detention centers, where immigrants are trapped in communal spaces. ICE has been hit with numerous lawsuits accusing it of not providing detainees with adequate medical care, including an August complaint alleging the agency has been failing to ensure centers operated by private contractors are meeting the standards of confinement mandated by federal law and the U.S. Constitution. Eunice Cho, an attorney for migrants, issued a statement vowing continued litigation. “Public health officials are in agreement — it is not a matter of if there is a COVID-19 outbreak in immigrant detention centers, but when,” Cho said. “ICE should heed their warning. By refusing to immediately release our clients, ICE is jeopardizing their lives and the lives of its staff and their families.” Law 360 reported that ICE responded Wednesday to the request for the restraining order, but the filing is not being made public.

"President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security quietly adopted a second tactic to speed the inflow of foreign H-1B workers into U.S. jobs — even though hundreds of thousands of American graduates are expected to lose their jobs in the next few weeks. An email sent out March 19 told companies that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency would accept electronic signatures instead of the original ink signatures that are normally required on the I-129 forms that must be filed to import foreign visa-workers: We will accept all benefit forms and documents with reproduced signatures. … For forms that require an original “wet” signature, per form instructions, USCIS will accept electronically reproduced original signatures for the duration of the National Emergency, Greg Siskind, a Tennessee-based immigration lawyer who works for employers, described the concession as “very good news.” The announcement came after the agency said it would speed the overall process by barring wealthier employers from buying their way to the front of the processing line, via the “premium processing” procedure. “Boooo!!! – Premium Processing Program Suspended by USCIS,” said another tweet by Siskind, some of whose clients prefer to pay the fee for premium processing.

She said her job ended when she was forced out by Indian managers, in part, because of her excellent performance reviews. She is in her 50s, has been unemployed for several months, and fears recruiters will blackball her if she speaks on the record. She told Breitbart News, “I’m not eligible for unemployment. So I have lived off my savings, and I’m living with my son. I’m still applying for jobs, but they’re very few and far between. I can’t relocate again because when they cut my contract job, I had to cut my lease off early, so now, my credit is bad. My lease history is bad. I can’t go and take the risks that I did before. I was getting ready to go and look for a minimum wage job until this coronavirus came here, you know. Come next month, you know what? I can’t pay my bills because I’ve gone for like eight months on my savings.” She added, “To be honest with you, I have given up on American companies. I have given up on being able to be hired by America because I’m American, and Americans don’t matter. And I’m sorry I’m going to get a little bit emotional here. … Americans don’t matter. I hear politicians, you know, saying, “Okay, you know what? We’re going to open our borders, and you can have free health…I don’t have health insurance. You know, Americans don’t matter. All that matters is foreign workers. All that matters is if the foreign individuals…I mean, it’s like we don’t matter. America doesn’t matter.” DHS on autopilot, says it will speed the award of 85,000 H-1B graduate visa-workers to US employers by barring corporate line-jumping via the 'premium processing' service.Meanwhile, myriad US grads will lose their jobs in April b/c of coronavirus. @S386https://t.co/LvhiwtqAbK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 19, 2020  The federal government should help Americans by stopping the inflow of visa workers, Fiona said: “Not only should they cancel the H-1B inflow, they should not renew H-1B visas. If American companies want to hire, they hire Americans. And if they say, ‘Americans don’t have the skills,’ give them the skills because we are America. And we take care of our own.” “Americans should be outraged if they’re going to bring in another 85,000 foreigners this year,” said Dawn Collins, a former vice-president at JP Morgan Chase, who founded Protect U.S. Workers to oppose the H-1B program.  She continued, “If American graduates are being replaced by foreigners while this [economic crash] is going on … We’re in a total crisis, and the H-1B program has to be ended right now … If there is any loyalty to the country in Congress, they have to give Americans a chance, a chance … [in this] this situation where people are losing theme homes, their jobs.” Nationwide, roughly 1.5 million U.S. white-collar jobs are held by foreign graduates, including roughly 1 million Indians. The H-1B program admits roughly 100,000 new foreign workers a year and they who can stay permanently once they are nominated for a green card by their employer. The resident population of H-1B workers is roughly 1 million, including roughly 750,000 Indian H-1Bs. USCIS announces flexibility in submitting required signatures during coronavirus national emergency. Company executives and “Human Resources” managers use the H-1Bs program to procure blocs of compliant, lower-skill foreign workers — mostly Indian or Chinese — for the many jobs sought by qualified and eager U.S. graduates and mid-career professionals. The H-1B workers sometimes cost more than American professionals, partly because they are often less productive than American graduates. But U.S. managers prefer them because the federal government rarely enforces routine workplace laws in H-1B workplaces. The government’s refusal to enforce the laws means the H-1Bs can be hired, fired, and abused by their bosses, most of whom are Indians who grew up in Indians’ own culture. These abuses include workplace intimidation, sexual discrimination, and unpaid overtime hours, Americans tell Breitbart News. The government inaction in H-1B workplaces also strips American graduates of routine workplace protections, including protections against commonplace discrimination because of their nationality. Numerous American graduates report that native-born Americans are a rarity in most Silicon Valley companies, as well as in insurance and banking industries on both coasts. Each April, 85,000 H-1B visas are awarded to U.S. companies via a USCIS rushed application and lottery process. Another “cap-exempt” 15,000 H-1Bs are awarded throughout the year to non-profit employers at universities, research laboratories, and hospitals. The cap-exempt employers are allowed to hire as many H-1Bs as they wish. The current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for the Indian-based outsourcing industry. The group’s mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to hire Indians graduates for jobs in the United States, and they split the economic gains among both countries’ companies, executives, and investors. Breitbart News asked DHS if the agency is considering curbs on the 2020 award of H-1B visas. “No changes at this time,” a spokesman responded on March 19. Meanwhile, business groups are trying to expand the H-1B program. For example, activists are citing the coronavirus as an excuse for Congress to allow investors to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates for jobs in the healthcare sector. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is also pushing his S.386 bill to reward additional Indians if they take jobs from American graduates. Trump’s failure to set curbs on the H-1B program has angered many of the swing-voting university graduates who supported him in 2016. In March 2016, after much zig-zagging, Trump declared: The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions. In February 2020, a U.S. judge struck down the token H-1B curbs set by USCIS managers since Trump’s election. Immigration reformers are calling for the cancellation of the 2020 H-1B awards amid the economic crash. American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers. In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher. Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries. The federal USCIS agency provides some data, including data about the uncapped OPT program, sometimes called the “Mini-H-1B”: DHS on autopilot, says it will speed the award of 85,000 H-1B graduate visa-workers to US employers by barring corporate line-jumping via the 'premium processing' service.Meanwhile, myriad US grads will lose their jobs in April b/c of coronavirus. @S386https://t.co/LvhiwtqAbK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 19, 2020 ",DHS Changes Rule to Import More H-1B Foreign Workers in Economic Meltdown,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/21/dhs-changes-rule-help-import-h-1b-foreign-workers-economic-meltdown/,Breitbart
"At the top of his Saturday MSNBC broadcast, Al Sharpton revealed he and President Donald Trump discussed his concerns with the coronavirus, which included the homeless and incarcerated. Sharpton said he was able to convey concerns for those that might not be able to take proactive measure to protect themselves from the pandemic. “Tonight’s lead: This week, in the spirit of unity, I made a moral appeal to the White House to consider the homeless and the incarcerated amid the COVID-19 crisis,” he said. “To my surprise, President Donald Trump called me to discuss it. He and I have exchanged some very contentious words over the last several years, and though we have not changed our view of each other, we did talk about the fact that in the midst of this pandemic, people that may be on different sides politically must discuss and try to come to some kind of common ground to deal with those in this country and around the world that are most vulnerable.” “I wanted to raise the point of those that are homeless and those that are incarcerated,” Sharpton continued. “They must be part of the equation because it is a moral issue, it is a humanitarian issue, and it is impractical to tell people that are homeless, that are not even in shelters, to stay home. It is really against any form of logic to tell people incarcerated in 6 X 12 cells to stay social distance six feet away from each other. So how do we test them, and how do we make sure that they are not, in fact, infecting others. How do we deal with the fact that most people in jail have been convicted of nothing, and therefore would be dealing with possible life sentences if they get the coronavirus while they’re awaiting trial, acquitted, go home, and they have been infected, and the worst could happen. He said he would consider it, made no promises, but the fact we talked helped put it on the national radar.” (h/t Newsbusters) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",MSNBC’s Al Sharpton: ‘To My Surprise’ Trump Called Me to Discuss Coronavirus Concerns,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/21/msnbcs-al-sharpton-to-my-surprise-trump-called-me-to-discuss-coronavirus-concerns/,Breitbart
"On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that during his contentious exchange with NBC’s Peter Alexander, President Trump “was sort of triggered by the idea of empathy.” Brooks stated, “Well, even on his best day, the president is unnerving. The fact that he lashed out at the reporter who asked a very simple and softball question, well, how would you comfort people who are afraid? First of all, he revealed that it was all about himself. He assumed the fear was — must be because he wasn’t doing a good job. And then he was sort of triggered by the idea of empathy. And so, that was just unnerving. To me, I worry about actual production. Are we actually producing tests?

"On March 21, 2020, USA Today fact checked Breitbart News’s report that New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (D) issued a coronavirus emergency order giving herself the power to ban the sale and transportation of firearms in the city. The result of their fact check was that the Breitbart News report is true. On March 16, 2020, Breitbart News reported that Mayor Cantrell had issued her order in two parts, over the course of less than a week. The end result was Cantrell claiming power to ban the sale and transportation of firearms and “suspend or limit the sale, dispensing, or transportation, of alcoholic beverages,” among other things. USA Today reported that Breitbart had a “March 16…article claiming the executive order issued by New Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell in response to the coronavirus allows the city to ban the transportation and sale of firearms.” They noted that some secondary outlets on Facebook grabbed Breitbart’s article and ran with it, resulting in “exaggerated versions of the claim circulated on the platform.” However, USA Today found that Breitbart’s claim about Mayor Cantrell’s order is true, “New Orleans now has the power to suspend the sale and transportation of firearms.” USA Today “contacted Cantrell’s office with multiple requests to comment but did not receive a response.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"New York State Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who is also a candidate to represent New York’s 11th Congressional District, joined SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Saturday and discussed the deadly coronavirus outbreak across America, specifically in New York. “As of last night, there were 43 deaths–and it’s extremely tragic and we’re doing everything we can to kind of stem this and also make sure that we’re getting the proper equipment to our hospitals and our nursing homes,” Malliotakis told host Matthew Boyle as she began expressing the importance of getting protective gear into the hands of healthcare workers. “We also need ventilators,” Malliotakis continued. “We’ve increased testing capacity, which is why you’re seeing the numbers in New York soar. … I think it’s very important that people do stay home. I know a lot of people are not listening to those recommendations, but it’s critical until we can flatten the curve that people do all they can to stay indoors when possible.” Malliotakis also stressed the importance of not showing up at “the hospital or your doctor’s office” and said individuals feeling symptomatic should first call their primary care physician.  On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wanted to release inmates into the city who are “vulnerable” to contracting the coronavirus. Malliotakis, who ran against de Blasio for the mayoral position, said there are many “far-left elected officials who are using this as an opportunity to push their agenda.” “What people need to understand is that in New York state, there’s only about ten percent of the arrested population that is actually jailed pre-trial,” she said. “New bail laws that took effect on January 1st under Governor [Andrew] Cuomo are extremely dangerous in the fact that they pretty much let out 90 percent of the arrest population, including those of some serious and violent crimes.” Malliotakis also stated that “public health should be the primary issue” for de Blasio. “We’re taking our direction from President Trump, from Governor Cuomo,” Malliotakis said. “If the mayor wants to focus on these other things, he can do that.” “This is a time for our country to come together, and we’re seeing that with our president, and we’re seeing that with our governor coming together to serve the people of our state,” she added, saying it is a time to “put politics aside.” Malliotakis also noted the financial impact the coronavirus is having on small businesses, saying she wants to make sure that is “part of the discussion.” “We have to help the people who have lost their jobs or are not working because they are sick, businesses have temporarily closed,” Malliotakis stated, adding that she believes the recovery will be very lengthy and Americans need relief now. “There’s a lot going on and there are a lot of moving parts, but we’re all working togethe, and that’s the most important thing,” Malliotakis concluded.

"California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Friday allowing residents to vote by mail in three upcoming special elections as a precaution against the Chinese coronavirus. The press release continued: The order also extends the deadlines for ballot counting, tabulation, and other responsibilities related to the official canvass of California’s Presidential Primary Election that could risk undermining social distancing measures, and suspends the timeframes for public hearings required by political subdivisions that are in the process of changing from an at-large method of election to district elections. The governor’s office said the purpose of the order is to protect public health and safety during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The special elections “shall each be held as an all-mail ballot election and conducted according to those provisions of the Elections Code that govern all-mail ballot elections,” the order’s text read. The document continued: The respective county elections officials responsible for conducting each respective election shall transmit vote-by-mail ballots to all voters eligible to vote in each respective election. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Order, elections officials are also authorized, and encouraged, to make in-person voting opportunities available on or before Election Day for each of these elections in a manner consistent with public health and safety, to maximize voter accessibility. Elections officials shall provide maximum possible notice to voters about how to participate in each of these elections, paying particular attention to the needs of voters at high risk from COVID-19, individuals with disabilities, and other voters with particularized needs. However, states would be better off taking small steps at first when it comes to voting by mail, according to Charles Stewart, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Hastily implemented changes to voting rules and laws can end up causing all types of problems that you didn’t anticipate,” he noted.

"Dr. Irwin Redlener, pediatrician and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, warned of a worsening medical supply shortage as the coronavirus continues to spread, offering his remarks on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. “The entire United States is going to experience this extraordinary crisis that we’re staring down, but the thing is it may not happen in every state and every place at the same time,” said Redlener. “It‘s virtually inevitable that we will be seeing this outbreak intensifying in one place after another. That said, I think what most of us in the field would have liked to have seen was some more a kind of explicit direction and guidance from the federal government.” A lack of standard operating practices from the federal government in responding to pandemics made America more vulnerable to the coronavirus, assessed Redlener, lamenting the “lack of clear guidance “from federal authorities regarding crowd-size limits. The absence of an established “public health strategy” to address pandemics “has resulted in a lot of freelancing by governors and mayors, who are all basically trying to do the best they can,” he added. LISTEN:  “I think it’s pretty inevitable that Florida is going to get pretty significantly hit, when how, I don’t know,” Redelner speculated. “Will they end up with school closures and some of these more draconian steps have been taken elsewhere? I would say probably.”
Redlener stated, “High-risk populations [are] going to have a fatality rate multiple-fold of what people without high risk [will have]. In other words, it’s the elderly, and especially the elderly with pre-existing conditions, but we also plenty of reports now about much younger people, mostly with pre-existing conditions.” “Every single credible epidemiologist — people who look at data, modeling, and trajectories — say we’re about ten days to two weeks behind Italy, so we get this very weird surreal view of where we are going,” cautioned Redlener. Redlener continued, “This disease doubles every — somewhere between — three and four days, now, and that’s geometric. That’s horrendous if you think about how quickly that adds up. … We are in the early stages of a crazy hospital crisis, and we’re talking about emergency rooms all over the country literally running out of protective gear. Somebody, a very high official in the United States Department of Health and Human services — a very high official — told me that we need between two and three billion face masks, for example, yet we have a tiny fraction of that.” American ingenuity and public-private partnerships may relieve the worsening shortage of medical supplies faced by hospitals and other healthcare operations, stated Redlener.  “On the other hand, I must say we have a lot of innovations. small board-type things where we have sewing groups literally around the country that are trying to make — according to a particular design — masks on their own [with] home sewing machines that may be okay. We’re negotiating with clothing manufacturers to see if we can manufacture safe effective masks that could be washed and reused.” Redlener shared, “My son runs an emergency room here in New York City — and by the way, this is deeply personal, obviously, to me — but he had to tell his staff that when they come in for their shifts that they put on their their boots, their suits, their gowns, their masks, their N95 special masks, and goggles, and they cannot change in between patients, which is what we ideally do, because they will run out in two days as opposed to two weeks, so we’re putting off the inevitable here.” Redlener and his professional peers are drawing parallels between the coronavirus outbreak and the 1918 Spanish flue. “We’re going to have problems that really have been unimaginable to contemplate,” Redlener predicted. “Two weeks ago I was talking about comparisons to SARS and the swine flu in 2009, but really we’ve all been whispering among each other in my field saying, ‘Oh my goodness, this is 1918 Spanish flu-level,’ and it is, and it’s happening fast, and we’re not prepared.” “The thing that’s been frustrating guys to me and many of us has been [that] we saw this coming in early January,” added Redlener. “We knew this was coming. There was no way that was going to be avoided and we really have dragged our feet. … We’re still having problems. I speak to emergency room and doctors literally every day just trying to keep up with things and we’re still taking three or four days to get a test result back. It’s incredibly inefficient and not ready yet.” Redlener went on,”I’m much more concerned about this new extraordinary crisis that our hospitals are going to be in and the risk to our healthcare workers, and by the way, we’re not just talking about doctors and nurses. You cannot run a hospital without the registrars, the aides, the people who clean the rooms, the dietitians, the respiratory therapists, and so on. When I say healthcare workers, I mean the entire system is essential here. “So where are we going to get these people? asked Redlener, echoing concerns of a shortage of healthcare professionals during the coronavirus crisis expressed by Maria Ryan, director of a rural hospital near the state line between New Hampshire and Vermont. “Even governors are [proposing] to bring in retired doctors and nurses. Well, you don’t want to bring those people. They’re older, and they have pre-existing medical conditions. So we’re going to put them in harm’s way in our emergency rooms? That can’t happen.”  “I don’t blame political leaders, because we’re we’re really struggling to find answers, and they are, too,” concluded Redlener. “Republicans, Democrats, this is the most non-partisan crisis we’ve had in memory and they’re all struggling and I give much credit to them for trying to figure out ways to solve this.” Global demand on globalized supply chains for medical supplies to address a worldwide pandemic will exacerbate shortages of needed goods, estimated Redlener. “Every hospital, every state, every country in the world is going after the same number of limited vendors of things we need, whether it’s mechanical ventilators or the protective gear,” Redlener remarked.” Mansour asked if industrial policy driven by the federal government can help alleviate ongoing shortages of medical supplies and medicines. Redlener replied, “I have a lot of faith in American ingenuity and the ability to ramp up when we have to, and I think World War II is an apt example of where everything turns towards the war effort and very successfully. “I think we’re capable of it, and I think we should be doing it,” continued Redlener, “Let’s say the people actually make mechanical ventilators, I think I saw a data that they were making like 150 a month, they need to make 5,000 a month, and I think they can do it. If the leadership in those industries takes this advice — this is a whole-country approach — that is exactly what we need, but we’re way behind.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

"An inmate at a federal jail in New York City has tested positive for coronavirus, marking the first confirmed case in the federal prison system WASHINGTON (AP) — An inmate at a federal jail in New York City has tested positive for coronavirus, marking the first confirmed case in the federal prison system. The inmate, who is housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, complained of chest pains on Thursday, a few days after he arrived at the facility, the federal Bureau of Prisons told The Associated Press. He was taken to a local hospital and was tested for COVID-19, officials said. The inmate was discharged from the hospital on Friday and returned to the jail, where he was immediately placed in isolation, the agency said. The Bureau of Prisons learned Saturday that he had tested positive for COVID-19. The inmate remained isolated away from other prisoners on Saturday, but medial and psychiatric staff were visiting him routinely, officials said. The confirmation of the first coronavirus case in the BOP system comes as jails and prisons across the country are taking precautions to slow the spread of coronavirus. Health officials have been warning for more than a decade about the dangers of outbreaks in jails and prisons, which are ideal environments for viruses: Inmates share small cells with total strangers, use toilets just a few feet from their beds, and are herded into day rooms where they spend hours at a time together. There have been two positive cases among BOP staff members: an employee who works at an administrative office in Grand Prairie, Texas, and another employee who works in Leavenworth, Kansas, but who officials said did not have contact with inmates since becoming symptomatic. The Bureau of Prisons has temporarily halted visitation at all 122 federal correction facilities across the U.S., including both social and legal visitation, though officials have said some exceptions could be made for legal visits. Officials said staffers at the Metropolitan Detention Center would continue to monitor the inmate and they were working to trace who he had contact with, as well as sanitizing “affected areas.” Other inmates who were housed with the man are also being quarantined, along with staff members who may have had contact with him. Every staff member and contractor entering the Metropolitan Detention Center is subject to an enhanced medical screening, including having their temperature taken with an infrared thermometer and are asked a series of questions to screen for coronavirus risk factors, a Bureau of Prisons official wrote in a letter to the chief judge in the Southern District of New York earlier this week. The agency said inmates at the lockup are free to walk about their housing units and use common areas but may also choose to “remain in their cells to self-seclude.” But officials said they were not going to isolate inmates who may be considered to be “at risk” because there were too many of them to isolate them on one or two units, according to the letter. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and even death. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover. ___ Associated Press writers Michael R.

Gen. Todd Semonite told reporters on Friday at the Pentagon. While the Army Corps of Engineers does not actually build projects itself, its engineers make assessments on projects that are needed and work with private contractors to build them. “We got money from FEMA to go into buildings on Tuesday night. We did the Javits Center yesterday, and we were into some of the SUNY schools yesterday,” he said. “Today, my engineers were walking through 10 other buildings — five of those are hotel-like capabilities, and five of those are open spaces,” he said. The agency is currently working with at least 18 states to expand available hospital bed space to address potential shortages. A recent USA Today study said that in the worst case scenario — if everyone who gets ill requires hospitalization — the civilian hospital system would have 5.7 patients for every bed. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday the state predicts that as many as 110,000 people will need beds in 45 days, when the state currently has 53,000 beds. Semonite said his agency is looking at turning hotels, college dormitories, and large spaces into temporary healthcare facilities. “We cut a contract to be able to have the state set up a lease with that particular facility…and we would go in and turn this into an ICU-like facility,” he said. He said there are four phases to converting an existing space to a medical facility: First, a state has to nominate facilities in prioritized order. Second, the Army Corps of Engineers, working with private contractors, has to come in and modify those facilities. Third, supplies need to be placed there. Fourth, the state needs to staff it. “Think of the second floor of a standard hotel. The rooms would be like a hotel room, and then we would build nurses’ stations in the halls, we would have all of the equipment, wireless going into the nurses’ stations,” he said. Every room would have to have negative air pressure, and doors outfitted with plastic with zippers on them. “It’s a relatively simple process,” Semonite said. He acknowledged time is of the essence, with most governors predicting a peak somewhere around the middle of April. He said the agency is dealing with the states with the biggest demand first. “We’re looking very hard at California, the state of Washington, we’ve already been in New Jersey,” he said. “We’re really looking at where’s the biggest demand, so we go to those states first.” He said the Army Corps of Engineers is designing a standard contract so that states can work with private industry directly. He continued: If states want to do this on their own and contract by themselves, we’re giving you something that is an [Health and Human Services]-validated concept and you don’t have to wait on the Corps of Engineers. You can do this independently, even to the point where you can go back and be able to try to secure that money through FEMA. So this goes back to where we need everybody going full-bore to be able to figure out: Where is that bed space capacity delta there and then how can everybody pull together to make this happen? “President Trump said yesterday on TV, you know, when things get going tough in America, everybody rallies,” he said. “We need our engineering contractors to be able to step up, the hotel industry to be able to step up.”   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Army Corps of Engineers Working with 18 States to Surge Hospital Space,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/21/army-corps-of-engineers-working-with-18-states-to-surge-hospital-space/,Breitbart
"Just as the coronavirus epidemic went nationwide, 1,200 young American doctors have been put on the sidelines because they were denied a place in the limited number of medical residencies for 2020, said Kevin Lynn, founder of Doctors Without Jobs.  “More than 6 percent of the graduates of U.S. medical colleges did not get ‘matched‘ into a residency this week in a hospital, which means they will never practice medicine,” said Lynn, “That is a systemic problem,” he said, adding, “we have an ever-increasing need for effective healthcare delivery in this country, and yet we seem to have made it extremely difficult to become a doctor.” Without a residency for specialized training on their resumé, the fully qualified doctors cannot get doctors’ jobs because they are excluded from employers’ insurance coverage, he said. Congress should quickly get the doctors into work during the epidemic by extending employers’ insurance coverage to include the many doctors who pass their tests but who have not had a residency, Lynn said.  The annual match process allocates graduates to the limited number of hospital residencies.  The graduates — including several thousand foreign graduates — have already passed the Medical Licensing Examination (MLE) but they cannot work as doctors until they serve a residency in a hospital, he said. “Failing to Match can represent a critical junction for medical students,” according to a 2019 article in opmed.doximity.com. It continued: Now is the time to decide if you want to move forward with your medical training. While this may seem like an obvious choice — after all, you’ve already put four years and tens of thousands of dollars into the process — that may not actually be the case for many. So, take the time to take stock of your goals. Talk to your family, loved ones, or partner. Consider looking into other careers in health care, such as hospital operations or consulting. Ultimately, you should ask yourself – is being a doctor truly my dream? “It took weeks, if not months, to recover from the emotional trauma of not matching,” according to a 2018 article at KevinMd, com. The female doctor continued, “The feeling of watching your friends and classmates see their dreams come to fruition while yours crumbled around you is earth-shattering for a medical student.” The American doctors are not excluded because they are unqualified, said Lynn. They have passed their college courses and the national MLE test, but do not get picked for specialized training because Congress does not fund enough residencies at hospitals, he said. “Are they at the top of their class? No, but they’re not in the bottom,” said Lynn. The 1,218 doctors excluded in 2020 is an increase from the 1,162 excluded doctors in 2019, the 1,078 excluded doctors in 2018, the 1,059 excluded doctors in 2017, and the excluded doctors 1,130 in 2016. These exclusion do not count the doctors who repeated their effort to get matched, he said.  The accumulated lists of excluded doctors have created an unrecognized national reserve of perhaps 5,000 fully qualified doctors who can be deployed during the coronavirus, Lynn said.  Last week, President Donald Trump and Congress changed insurance rules to allow people to use tens of millions of N95 face masks that were designed for non-medical purposes. McClatchy reported March 20: The purpose of the new legislative provision is to protect manufacturers from liability if U.S. citizens use the masks outside of a hospital environment during a public health crisis, and contract disease. Under current law, “someone could buy one from Home Depot and say they got coronavirus while walking on the street and wearing a respirator, and the manufacturer will be liable,” said one congressional aide involved in the deliberations. In Italy, where the epidemic is further advanced, the government has mobilized roughly 10,000 student doctors to the front line. We have a pandemic with hospitals short staffed while thousands of medical graduates with full requirements for state/federal provisional licensure sit unmatched! This is ridiculous and I am TIRED of it. We need to fix #MedEd #medtwitter — Michael McClurkin, MD, MPP  (@MikeMcClurkinMD) March 18, 2020  The supply of hospital residencies is limited because they are funded by Congress — and Congress limits the funding each year. The number of residencies puts a cap on the flow of new doctors into the sector — and so drives up salaries for current doctors. The mismatch also encourages various employers to import doctors from the Middle East, India, and Africa under various visa-worker programs. The visa programs, such as the H-1B and J-1 programs, extract the foreign doctors that people in the foreign countries need for their health and economic growth. Africa’s doctors are being extracted by U.S, European, and Arab governments who refuse to fund training programs for their own would-be-doctors, according to an April 2019 report in Al Jazeera: Abuja, Nigeria – In March, hundreds of Nigerian doctors gathered at a hotel in Abuja, the capital, and another in Lagos, the country’s commercial centre, to take a test conducted by the Saudi Arabian health ministry. In a symbol of the Nigerian medical “brain drain”, those yet to migrate must complete foreign exams in order to get work placements abroad. Weeks before the attempt by Saudi Arabia to lure Nigeria’s greatest medical talents, dozens had sat the regular Professional Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB) exams at the British Council. Once they pass, it will enable them to work in the UK. ,,, “The trend of doctors emigrating to other countries is at an all-time high,” Chike Nwangwu, head of NOIPolls, told Al Jazeera in Abuja. “Our survey … showed that 88 percent of doctors are considering work opportunities abroad.” Can we do this in #America with our doctors who graduated in good standing and didn't get residency?https://t.co/JIJZk2dDEo#Congress #Senate @realDonaldTrump @AmerMedicalAssn — Doctors without Jobs (@DocsWithoutJobs) March 19, 2020  In the United States, the imported doctors most slowly migrate through a complex immigration system, often leaving them with partial workplace rights for several years. For example, roughly 5,000 Indian-born doctors are waiting in a multi-year waiting line for green cards. The line is long because it is choked by an army of roughly 600,000 Indian H-1B workers and family members who have been imported by U.S. technology companies, banks, and insurance firms and their Indian-run staffing companies. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is pushing his S.386 bill to put the many Indian workers to the front of the green card line — regardless of the impact on non-Indian migrants, and without any exemption for doctors. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) is pushing a bill that would provide more funding for 15,000 extra residencies per year. His S.348 bill is titled the “Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2019,” sand it ays: the aggregate number of increases in the otherwise applicable resident limit under this subparagraph shall be equal to 3,000 in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025, of which at least 1,500 in each such fiscal year shall be used for full-time equivalent residents training in a shortage specialty residency program. Menendez’s bill has 17 co-sponsors, including Sen. Susan Collins, (R-ME) “Not only do we need the additional residencies, but we also need the prioritization of American graduates to get those residencies,” said Lynn, who noted that U.S. hospitals awarded residencies to thousands of foreign doctors each year.  “It gets down to OK, what’s the value of spending years at an Americans college, accumulating all that debt and cost? Why not go to India and go to medical school there?” he asked. “There has to be a value in going to an accredited U.S. medical college.” Donald Trump's DHS used another tactic to speed the delivery of 85,000 new foreign graduates into American grads' jobs: It quietly changed signature rules so corps. could file requests via the Internet amid the epidemic for H-1B workers b4 3/20 deadline.https://t.co/rsgZeHClla — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 21, 2020

"Expanding curbs on elective and cosmetic surgery is preventing people who say they are transgender from getting “lifesaving” operations, according to an article in Vice magazine. The reporter who wrote the article, titled ,“As Hospitals Prepare for COVID-19, Life-Saving Trans Surgeries Are Delayed,” interviewed a handful of people who face delays getting breasts removed or genitalia altered. Meanwhile, according to Johns Hopkins, real-time data about the coronavirus from around the globe show that, as of Friday, 258,052 people have the virus and 11,268 have died, including 216 in the United States. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 0.6 percent of people in the United States identified as transgender in 2016. But Vice portrayed the plight of transgenders as dangerous during this emergency health crisis where in two states so far — California and New York — people have been ordered to stay home. Vice’s report claims that “gender-affirming surgery” is necessary: For transgender and gender non-conforming people, gender-affirming surgeries are life-altering procedures, which, for many, can greatly reduce gender dysphoria and improve their quality of life. But in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, trans communities on Reddit and Twitter are being flooded with reports of postponed and canceled surgeries in the U.S., U.K., Spain, Thailand, and elsewhere, leading to enormous stress and disappointment on top of a global health crisis. This underscores a common experience amongst trans people seeking medical care or surgery: Research has suggested that gender-affirming surgery, in particular, has a notable and long-term impact on mental health, but far too often, trans people already wait far longer than is safe or healthy for this care. Further delays can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Violet Jones, a transgender person who lives in New York City is still hoping to get a procedure done in May. For now, Mayor Bill de Blasio issued an executive order delaying none-emergency surgery for “the next few weeks.” “This is the third time it’s been postponed,” she, described as “he” in Vice’s report, said. “It’s getting more and more heartbreaking to keep getting so close to something that will make me feel better and feel like I’m in the right body for once,” she said. Vice said even in relatively normal circumstances transgender people face challenges to achieve their life-altering surgeries, including insurance issues, despite the fact that the American Medical Association in recent years shifted its policies to say these surgeries are “medically necessary” to treat gender dysphoria. Joshua Safer, executive director at Mount Sinai’s Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, told VICE that staff are reaching out to patients. He said: Our team is on duty for patients with concerns that cannot be postponed including in-person post-operative care for our surgical patients, especially those who have had recent surgeries. We are also instituting some telehealth capacity to help some patients for whom that makes sense. “As soon as it is safe to do so, all postponed surgeries and clinic appointments will be rescheduled with the highest priority,” Safer said.

"Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost ordered two abortion clinics in the state to follow a directive that bans non-essential or elective procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. Yost sent letters Saturday to Women’s Med Center in Dayton and Planned Parenthood of Cincinnati Surgery Center after receiving complaints that both had refused to close following an order from Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton. “You and your facility are ordered to immediately stop performing non-essential and elective surgical abortions,” Yost said, reported the Columbus Dispatch: Non-essential surgical abortions are those that can be delayed without undue risk to the current or future health of a patient. If you or your facility do not immediately stop performing non-essential or elective surgical abortions in compliance with the (health director’s) order, the Department of Health will take all appropriate measures. The order from Acton on Wednesday reportedly said, “all non-essential or elective surgeries and procedures that utilized (personal protective equipment) should not be conducted.” “The state is attempting to preserve supplies of equipment needed in combating the virus,” reported the Dispatch. The abortion industry has demanded the procedure be considered an “essential” service that is the equivalent of “health care.” CBS reported Iris E. Harvey and Kersha Deibel, the respective heads of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region, said in a joint statement the Southwest Ohio Region clinic was in compliance with Acton’s order, which allows Planned Parenthood to “still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion, and our health centers continue to offer other health care services that our patients depend on. Our doors remain open for this care.” A statement by several abortion advocacy groups Wednesday also said: Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care. It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible. The National Abortion Federation also stated that abortion is “part of the continuum of pregnancy care.” “It is an essential health service,” the group that represents abortion providers said. ""As we navigate COVID-19, it is critical that leaders treat outpatient abortion providers as essential businesses, and that hospital systems ensure the continuation of abortion care as an essential service.""https://t.co/zsj2HQ97le — NAF (@NatAbortionFed) March 17, 2020  However, in a statement sent to Breitbart News, Patrina Mosley, Family Research Council’s director of life, culture, and women’s advocacy, disagreed completely: Abortion is not healthcare. Keeping the doors open to kill children in the middle of a pandemic shows you exactly who the abortion industry is and have always been: a tool of eugenics. Mosley continued the abortion lobby considers the coronavirus pandemic yet another “opportunity to continue to control population growth in the midst of a quarantine that will inevitably produce a baby boom.” In Maine, a group of abortion and birth control clinics openly said it was extending its contraception prescriptions for women by three months for fear more time at home during the pandemic would result in a “baby boom.” “It’s just human nature, if you’re home, there are more opportunities to have sexual relations,” said Evelyn Kieltyka, vice president of program services at Maine Family Planning, reported the Union Leader. “I haven’t looked at the data, but my memory says that in times when people have had to stay home for long periods of time, there could be a little baby boom,” she added. “The nation’s largest abortion supplier, Planned Parenthood, founded by renowned eugenicist, Margaret Sanger, is a billion-dollar business,” Mosley said. “Do you think they are going to stand by now and not get paid? It’s important to understand that abortion is a business – not health care.”",Ohio Orders Abortion Clinics to Stop Performing ‘Elective’ Abortions,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/21/ohio-orders-abortion-clinics-to-stop-performing-elective-abortions/,Breitbart
"National Guard Bureau Chief Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel said recently he does not see any demand from states to have Guard members act in law enforcement roles. He said during a Pentagon briefing on Thursday: In many disasters and response, when there’s a pressure put on otherwise civilian, law enforcement activities, people get sick, they need more law enforcement potential out there, then the National Guard could be used in that capacity. But, he said, “I don’t see any demand signal that’s demanding we’re going to use the National Guard in that kind of scenario.” He said state governors could ask National Guard members to augment law enforcement if needed — something they could not do if the president federalizes them. Lengyel also said federalizing the National Guard does “not make sense” in dealing with coronavirus, or mobilizing them under the federal government versus state governments. He explained that it would make things more difficult for governors who wish to use the National Guard in different capacities: The best use of the National Guard is to use the National Guard for the unique authorities that it has, and that is to remain under the command and control of the networks in the states. Every state has a different way to deal with disasters, and the National Guard is uniquely qualified and postured to act under the command and control of the governors in the state. And so if you were to federalize them, you would lose that ability, and you would lose some other things. … So, while — I mean certainly the president can mobilize and federalize the National Guard but it would be my advice and there’s no plans that I’m aware of to take the National Guards in the states and put them in a federal status. They are much better used in a state status under command and control of the governors. There are 450,000 men and women who serve in the National Guard. Lengyel said so far, 27 states have mobilized about 2,000 Guard members. He said he expects that to grow to tens of thousands of Guard members being mobilized within states in the next couple of weeks. He said Guard members are doing a number of things in the nation’s coronavirus response. He said they can provide assistance with testing, ground transportation, air transportation, logistics, and a number of other things: For example, he said: — the New York National Guard has been helping local officials distribute food;
— the Tennessee Air National Guard’s C-17 delivered half a million swabs for test kits to Memphis;
— more than 500 soldiers in South Florida are assisting with collecting samples for drive-through testing in Broward County;
— in Maryland, the National Guard is supporting medical assessments and testing site operations;
— in Wisconsin they are supporting transportation missions for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services; and
— in Louisiana, Guard liaison officers are assisting the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. “This is just a sample of the efforts that we are supporting across the country,” he said, adding: Going forward, we expect the role of the National Guard will continue to grow and evolve to meet the country’s needs during this historic pandemic. We remain flexible and committed to whatever mission we may be called to do. “I want to thank all of our Guard members and all the first responders for their service during this difficult time. We continue to rise to every challenge before us and continue to work with our partners to keep our nation safe and remain true to our motto: Always Ready, Always There.”  ",National Guard Chief: No Demand for Forces to Act as Law Enforcement,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/21/national-guard-chief-no-demand-for-forces-to-act-as-law-enforcement/,Breitbart
"If Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) is not prosecuted by the Department of Justice for insider trading, then the Stock Act is “meaningless,” warned Peter Schweizer, senior contributor to Breitbart News and author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite. Schweizer joined Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward to discuss Burr’s selling of between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stock ahead of coronavirus-related market declines.
“Richard Burr’s [stock sell-off] is a classic case of insider trading,” determined Schweizer. “If Richard Burr was an executive at a corporation and he had received a closed door briefing that said a company’s sales were going to go down dramatically, and he sold pretty much all of his stock, it would be insider trading.” LISTEN:  “The Intelligence Committee got closed door briefings about the coronavirus that were pretty apocalyptic, and on February the 13th, [Richard Burr] decided to unload stock,” noted Schweizer, highlighting Burr’s role as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I believe there were 33 transactions, all of them sales, none of them were buys, and the part that is particularly troubling is the sales amount to at least half of his entire net worth.” Schweizer continued, In other words, [Richard Burr] is almost liquidating all the stock that he owns. So it’s a dramatic move, and yet, he is publicly telling people — he wrote an op-ed for Fox News, he was telling people in interviews — that this is really not a big deal.”
“He clearly realizes he’s been caught,” said Schweizer of Burr. “He admits that he did the trades, and what he’s now going to try to do is get this pushed off to the Senate Ethics Committee, which frankly, it’d be like you or me getting in trouble and saying well, ‘We’re going to let our family take a look at this and decide on our punishments.’ Nothing is going to happen with the Senate Ethics Committee of substance.” Schweizer added, “In my mind, it needs to be investigated and there needs to be a prosecution by the Department of Justice.” “The Stock Act was passed with the critical support of [Andrew] Breitbart,” recalled Schweizer. “Andrew Breitbart was alive at this time and pushed very, very hard for it, and was one of the earliest people behind it. What the Stock Act basically did, passed in 2012, is it extended insider trading laws to members of Congress and their staffs, and what it basically said was that if you are trading stock based on non-public information that you have access to, you can be prosecuted for insider trading. It also required more detailed reporting by elected officials.  The Stock Act also requires disclosure of stock market transactions every 30 days, added Schweizer. Burr’s stock sell-off meets the criteria for an investigation according to Securities Exchange Commission standards, Schweizer remarked. “If there were ever the sort of case that would warrant this, it would be Senator Burr, because what you look for is a couple of things, and this is based on insider trading [laws] on Wall Street. First of all, does a person make a series of highly unusual and highly successful trades that are well timed? Well in Burr’s case, absolutely. He dumps massive amounts of his stock, and that stock, over the next couple of weeks, dropped by more than 30 percent. So he literally saved himself hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses.” Burr’s behavior also qualifies as an unusual trade given the senator’s prior conduct, observed Scheweizer, “If you look at [Richard Burr’s] trading history going back several years, you cannot find a similar type of transaction.” “Does [Richard Burr] have access to non-public information?” asked Schweizer. “In other words, does he have information [about] something that’s going to adversely affect the economy [or] stock market that is not out there in the public? Absolutely, he did. We know he got these private briefings, and we know that in some cases, the next day after briefings, he was dumping stock. So to me, it’s a clear-cut case, and any attempt to kind of muddy the water or have the Senate Ethics Committee sort of slap his wrist is just wrong. None of us would get the benefit of that, why should a United States senator?” “I think the Department of Justice should open an investigation,” advised Schweizer. “He’s admitted that he himself made the trades. He’s not using the defense that some other people are using, which is that, ‘Well, my broker did it.’ He’s admitting that he made the trades. What he’s saying is, ‘I based those trades on public information,’ which kind of makes him a Svengali, because at this time in February, the stock market is near an all-time high, and the coronavirus [was] not really something that people [were] aware of.  Schweizer went on, “They were aware of it in China, but nobody was talking about the sort of apocalyptic numbers publicly at that time [as] they are now, so to me, the evidence is pretty clear, and if you look at the people who have been prosecuted on insider trading charges elsewhere, there’s far less evidence than there is in this case.” Schweizer estimated, “Senator Burr should resign from office, and if he’s not going to resign from office, I think it’s incumbent upon the Senate leadership to make an example of him that this is not acceptable behavior, and,at least censure him or even throw him out of the body if those rules apply, but he needs to be prosecuted, or these laws and rules are meaningless. They are meaningless if they’re not going to be enforced. “ Corrupt congressional self-enrichment includes funneling taxpayer funds to corporations politicians and officials are invested in, explained Schweizer. “Look at the giant massive bailout bill that the House has put together, that the Senate is voting on, [and] that the president’s probably going to sign,” recommended Schweizer. “These are massive bills with all kinds of intricate details concerning industries. … The people writing that legislation [and] voting on that legislation [are] buying and selling stock in these very companies that they are bailing out.” The reason “bailouts” are directed to “large publicly traded corporations” and not “mom and pop restaurants around the street,” assessed Schweizer, is that politicians own stock in large public companies and not in small local businesses.
 Politicians and government officials must place their investments into blind trusts to avoid such aforementioned abuses of power, Schweizer concluded. “This is a huge problem,” determined Schweizer. “The only way to deal with it — and it’s not a perfect solution — is that any elected official or senior government official that has any assets — let’s say above a hundred thousand dollars — they should all be put into a blind trust with a sworn deposition under the penalty of a felony that you will not talk to the trustees of your trust about anything.” Schweizer remarked, “That’s the only way you’re going to nip this in the bud, because it is something that occurs all the time, and people that are rewriting healthcare law or rewriting the defense budget should not be allowed to be trading stock in the very companies that are going to be affected by the bills.” “What the political class is telling us is, you know, ‘Trust us. We didn’t do it. This just needs to go away,’ and nobody else in America is allowed to do that other than these people,” Schweizer said.

"Distilleries nationwide are changing their operations to produce more hand sanitizer to combat coronavirus, the president announced at the White House on Saturday. President Donald Trump used Pernod Ricard USA as an example of this development: This is really an example where we are repurposing alcohol. They went out and repurposed their alcohol production capabilities in Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia to make hand sanitizer, and it’s a big difference. “And they’ve been unbelievable,” Trump said.  “Their first delivery will go out on Tuesday,” Trump said. “It’s going to go to various states.” “They’re going to start I think in New York and they’re going to work their way around,” Trump said. “They’re making a tremendous amount of hand sanitizer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires hand sanitizers to be at least 60 percent alcohol to make them effective. Two distillers located in the nation’s capitol are also stepping up to the plate. “We’ve got all this high-proof booze around, why not put it to use?” Cotton & Reed co-founder Jordan Cotton said in a DCist article. “You can’t get [hand sanitizer], so therefore you have to make it. In order to make it, you have to have good, high-proof spirit,” Republic Restoratives founder and CEO Pia Carusone said in the same article. “These sort of crises demand innovation.” The DCist reported on how that innovation is taking place: Republic Restoratives’ cleanser is made from 140-proof ethyl alcohol, vegetable glycerine, and hydrogen peroxide. Cotton & Reed’s is made with 66 percent ABV rum (the only spirit they manufacture) vegetable glycerine, and essential oils like bergamot, lemon, and orange. Cotton & Reed is also handing out free groceries and hand sanitizer to service and hospitality workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic, as part of the Friends and Family Meal initiative—a nonprofit that provides food from local farmers to those in need. “The oils take over [the aroma], but there’s a certain rum-iness to it,” Cotton said. An order from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser resulted in both distilleries shuttering their tasting rooms and bars, but alcohol retailers can still sell their products through delivery services or at their retail counters. U.S. News and World Report also reported on this trend: Distilleries must follow strict rules for the products they sell under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, but many are working with state officials to legally make the switch to producing hand sanitizer. The recipe “starts with ethanol, which is what we have plenty of in the distillery, then you add glycerin, hydrogen peroxide water and you mix it up,” Scott Jendrek, owner of Patapsco Distilling Co. in Sykesville, Maryland, told a local NBC News affiliate. In Vermont, Smugglers’ Notch Distillery plans to release a hand sanitizer this week at its Waterbury and Jeffersonville locations. According to NBC News, part of the proceeds will be donated to the state’s efforts to combat the outbreak. “I know I have a unique opportunity to help out a little bit and keep my staff employed,” Jeremy Elliott, the company’s co-owner, said in the article. And in Colorado, Spirit Hound Distillers is storing its hand sanitizer solution in spray bottles donated from a local skin and body care company. Spirit Hound has donated its hand sanitizer to its local fire department, businesses, and a local home health care nurse.  “Within two hours, we filled 1,000 four-ounce bottles and a bunch of gallon jugs and we are giving them out,” Craig Engelhorn, the company’s head distiller, told the Denver Post. “Nearby in Boulder, J&L Distilling has also delivered handmade hand sanitizer to its local fire department and some senior care organizations,” World Report reported. “There’s a need in the community and I’m uniquely positioned to fill it,” co-founder Seth Johnson said.

Pritzker (D) issued an executive order Friday to put a statewide shutdown in place, he exempted gun and ammunition stores by labeling them “essential.” The order, titled “Executive Order in Response to COVID-19 (COVID-19 Executive Order No. 8),” contains various headings, under which are listings of businesses considered “essential” for day-to-day life. Under the heading, “Supplies for Essential Businesses and Operations,” the order makes clear that “firearm and ammunition suppliers and retailers” can remain open, noting that they serve the purposes of “safety and security.” The Second Amendment Foundation’s Alan Gottlieb reacted to Pritzker’s recognition of the “essential” nature of firearms to the American life by saying, “When an anti-gun Democrat Governor declares that essential businesses includes firearm and ammunition suppliers and retailers for purposes of safety and security, that is really a big deal. Every Governor should copy the Illinois example when issuing stay in place and business closure orders in the face of the Corona Virus.” The businesses not listed as “essential” will be closing at 5 p.m. on March 21, 2020, per the Executive Order.

"The National School Transportation Association (NSTA) is calling upon Congress during the coronavirus pandemic to either require states to maintain funding of school bus services that private contractors provide to school districts, or pass a $2.8 billion bailout. In a letter sent to leaders of both parties in the House and Senate, NSTA Executive Director Curt Macysyn described two possible plans to maintain funding to school bus transportation employees during the school closures caused by the Chinese coronavirus: The first would entail “a directive edict or declaration” that a condition to receiving additional federal funds would be to maintain current funding of school bus contractors, while schools remain closed. A second proposal would appropriate the emergency funding so contractors can continue paying approximately 250,000 transportation employees, including school bus drivers, “to maintain student welfare through extraordinary sanitizing measures and maintain the integrity of their fleets and companies.”  In a second letter to the governors of all 50 states and U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Macysyn stated: These are extraordinary times, and we urge you to take immediate action that directs state Departments of Education to require their school districts to continue to pay for pupil transportation funding for a 180-day school year, in the event of any reduction in transportation days. These funds are already allocated in State budgets and a mechanism is currently in place to distribute these funds. Our concern lies within our desire to maintain a sound student transportation infrastructure through this health crisis, a system that requires us to be prepared to re-engage immediately after this unprecedented interruption to the school year. It will not serve the schoolchildren of this country to have 38 percent of available student transportation options eliminated after this crisis subsides. Macysyn noted to the congressional leaders that California, Illinois, and Minnesota have put in motion a process to continue funding. According to NSTA, the American Bus Association and the United Motorcoach Association are also seeking “$10 billion on congressional grant funds and $5 billion in zero-percent interest rate loans to the commercial bus industry.”",School Bus Industry Group Demands Continued Payments or $2.8 Billion,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/21/school-bus-industry-group-demands-continued-payments-or-2-8-billion/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump on Saturday at the White House expressed his disappointment that China was dishonest and slow to alert the world about the seriousness of the coronavirus. “I have great respect for China, I like China, I think the people of China are incredible. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi. I wish they could have told us earlier about what was going on inside,” Trump said. The president said that his federal doctors could have used the extra time to prepare for the virus. “China was secretive OK?” Trump said. “Very, very secretive, and that’s unfortunate.” Trump said that a two or three month jump on the virus would have been helpful. “They were having a big problem and they knew it, and I wish they could have given us an advance warning,” Trump said. The president was questioned about his message on Twitter in January praising President Xi Jinping and his transparency. China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020  Trump said that he felt that China was transparent at the time, but pointedly told reporters they did not escape unscathed from the virus. “China has lost thousands and thousands of people,” Trump said. “China has gone through hell over this. They’ve gone through hell.” Trump repeated that President Xi was “a friend” but wishes they would have been more vocal about the problem. “I just wished they could have told us earlier,” Trump said. Trump has sent a mixed message on China, frequently praising President Xi’s efforts to battle the coronavirus, but also describing it as the “Chinese virus” to remind the American public that it originated in China. On February 13, Trump praised Xi as “extremely capable” for handling the crisis but admitted that “they want to put the best face on it.” “You wouldn’t want to run out to the world and go crazy and start saying whatever it is, because you don’t want to create a panic,” he said during an interview with Geraldo Rivera.

Woods was in a senior care center in Washington state when she tested positive for the virus on March 6.

By March 18 she still had a stuffy nose and some coughing but tested negative for the virus. “By all accounts, she’s doing well,” Pence said, after sharing her story. “She wanted America to know that there is hope and her strength and her enthusiasm is truly an inspiration to the nation.” In an interview with the Kirkland Reporter, Wood’s daughter, Cami Neidigh, expressed her relief at the news. “I feel it’s important to give people some hope. Getting this virus is not a death sentence for the elderly or anybody,” said Neidigh.  Pence said that Wood’s story gave hope to Americans and again promised to win the fight against the virus. “As the president said many times, we’re going to get through this,” Pence said. “And come out stronger than ever before, and we’ll get through this as Americans together.”",Mike Pence Celebrates Story of Great Great Grandmother Recovering from Coronavirus,2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/21/mike-pence-celebrates-story-of-great-great-grandmother-recovering-from-coronavirus/,Breitbart

The move followed hot on the heels of French border guards seizing another heavy goods vehicle carrying hand sanitiser to Britain the day before. The incidents triggered a diplomatic spat between the two countries as Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) struggles against the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “On Tuesday night, French authorities stopped the hand sanitiser and confiscated the lot,” a British government source confirmed to The Sun. “On Wednesday night, it was lorries full of FFP3 face masks to protect staff.” London Hospital Declares ‘Critical Incident’ over Coronavirus, Not Enough Spaces for Patients https://t.co/LjWElpsjZf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  Another source in Whitehall tried to play down the incidents, however, claiming both were “dealt with relatively quickly.” “There is a clear understanding between countries that only a united approach will tackle the public health emergency all countries face,” they suggested, adding that the mask seizure “appears to have been a misunderstanding, [and] we’re confident it won’t happen again.” Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the eurosceptic former Tory leader and Cabinet minister, remained distinctly unimpressed, saying of the incident: “This shows you all you need to know about European co-operation.” Report: Overwhelmed London Hospitals Turning Away Coronavirus Patients https://t.co/t0phaqMSXM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020 ","Macron’s France SEIZES Lorries Carrying 130,000 Masks to British Hospitals",2020-03-21,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/21/macrons-france-seizes-lorries-carrying-130000-masks-to-british-hospitals/,Breitbart
"(AFP) — Australia on Sunday announced a $38 billion spending plan to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, as citizens were told to cancel domestic travel plans to slow the virus spread. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the latest Aus$66 billion announced Sunday brought government and central bank measures to support the economy to Aus$189 billion — or nearly 10 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). “These extraordinary times require extraordinary measures and we face a global challenge like we have never faced before,” he told reporters in Canberra. “Today’s announcement will provide hope and support for millions of Australians at a time when they need it most.” Small businesses and non-profits will receive cash subsidies of up to Aus$100,000, unemployment payments will be temporarily doubled and pensioners will receive Aus$750 cash. Workers whose income has fallen by at least 20 per cent due to the coronavirus outbreak will be able to access their retirement funds early, with those facing hardship allowed to withdraw up to Aus$20,000 over two years. Frydenberg said the economic shock was now expected to be “deeper, wider and longer” than was believed just 10 days ago and additional measures would be required. The country appears poised to slip into recession as a result of the coronavirus outbreak after a record 29-year run of economic growth. Australia has recorded more than 1,200 cases and seven deaths from COVID-19.

He said work-related trips, the transport of essential supplies and travel on compassionate grounds could continue but people should cancel any other travel plans ahead of the upcoming Easter school holidays. “More stronger measures will be coming and they will be coming in more localised areas to deal with outbreaks,” Morrison said. “What that means is, what may be necessary in a part of Sydney may not be necessary at all in… other parts of the country.” Australia has already sealed off its borders, putting in place an unprecedented ban on entry for non-residents in the hope of stemming the rise of COVID-19 infections. Three Australian regions — the island state of Tasmania, South Australia state, and the Northern Territory — have also implemented a 14-day self-isolation period for all visitors. New South Wales state on Sunday announced a shutdown of non-essential services, with supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations among those businesses that are exempt.

"ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) – A strong earthquake shook Croatia and its capital on Sunday, causing widespread damage and panic. A 15-year-old was killed and there were other injuries, media reported. The European seismological agency, EMSC, said the earthquake measured 5.3 and struck a wide area north of the capital, Zagreb, at 6:23 a.m. (0523 GMT) Sunday. The epicentre was 7 kilometres (4 miles) north of Zagreb at the depth of 10 kilometres (6 miles). Many buildings cracked in Zagreb and walls and rooftops were damaged. Downtown streets were littered with debris. Concrete slabs fell on cars and chimneys landed in front of entrances. Croatian media said a 15-year-old died. Officials said there were other injuries, but gave no immediate details. Inside homes, residents shared photos of belongings falling off shelves, broken bottles and glass. The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the coronavirus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had no choice as they ran out of their apartments. Up to five people keeping distance are allowed to be together. Zagreb’s iconic cathedral was also damaged with the top of one of its two spires collapsing. The cathedral was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake. Power was cut as people ran out of their homes. Several fires were also reported. At least two other tremors were recorded later. ___ Associated Press writers Dusan Stojanovic and Jovana Gec contributed to this report.",Croatia Virus Lockdown Disrupted by Strong Earthquake,2020-03-22,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/22/croatia-virus-lockdown-disrupted-by-strong-earthquake/,Breitbart

"ROME — The redoubtable Cardinal Joseph Zen has once again denounced Vatican diplomacy with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), saying it has left the underground Catholic Church “more and more” abandoned. In recent years, the underground community has been “considered inconvenient, almost as an obstacle to unity, while in the community officially recognized by the Government the ‘opportunists’ grow more and more numerous, fearless and defiant because encouraged by people inside and around the Vatican, intoxicated by their illusions of the Ostpolitik,” wrote the former bishop of Hong Kong in a letter dated March 10 but published Saturday. In his “supplement” to an earlier online letter addressed to Vatican Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, Cardinal Zen notes that his problem is not so much with Pope Francis as with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who “manipulates the Pope, at least in things regarding the Church in China.” Zen has often said he believes Pope Francis to be “naïve” with regard to Chinese communism, which makes him vulnerable to manipulation both by his own advisers and by China’s leaders. Although Cardinal Zen has been very critical of the Vatican’s 2018 deal with the CCP over the appointment of bishops in China, he notes in his new letter that that deal is not nearly as destructive as the “Pastoral Guidance” issued by the Vatican last June 28, which allows Catholic clerics to enlist in the state-run Catholic Patriotic Association. In comparison, the pastoral guidance “is more blatantly evil, immoral, because it legitimizes a schismatic Church!” Zen writes. There is “much confusion and contradiction” in that document, Zen asserts, since it allows Catholic priests to join a shadow church that is “independent” from Rome while Vatican officials insist that the word “independent” should no longer be understood to mean “absolutely independent.” At the same time, however, those priests who choose to sign a document promising to join the independent Church must “make some protest (written or verbal, with or without a witness!?)” Zen notes, which contradicts the idea that there is nothing wrong with the Patriotic Association. “How do you reconcile the signing of a document and the protesting that you don’t mean what you sign? You use the signature to cheat the Government? Or you use the protest to cheat the Church? But you can not cheat yourself!” Zen writes. The cardinal asserts that the situation of the Chinese Church now is worse than it was 20 years ago, in part because of the intensified persecution of the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping, in part because of inept Vatican diplomacy. “During the years around 2000 there was a real hope that we could soon reconstruct the unity of the Catholic Church in China,” Zen writes, which is unfortunately no longer the case. The false “unity” lived by the Church in China today, Zen insists, is based on capitulation to the CCP by yielding partial authority in the naming of bishops, the rehabilitation of seven illegitimate, excommunicated bishops “without a visible sign of repentance for their incredibly defiant attitude in the past,” and the invitation for Catholic clergy to join the Patriotic Association “where the leaders of the old residents sing victory.” “Is this the Catholic Church reunited? Only because the Pope has been made to believe that this is ‘the real thing’?” Zen asks.

The 80-year-old Khamenei chose to traffic in the same propaganda increasingly used by Chinese officials about the epidemic to deflect blame for its origins, as Breitbart News reported. “Possibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,” Khamenei said, in coments carried by the official IRNA agency. “Or if you send therapists and doctors, maybe he wants to see the effect of the poison, since it is said that part of the virus is built for Iran.” “Our number one enemy is America. It is the most wicked, sinister enemy of Iran … its leaders are terrorists … Liars and charlatans.” There is zero scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei’s anti-U.S. comments. That did not stop Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao who earlier this month repeated allegations from the Chinese Foreign Ministry that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in America and was intentionally spread to China by the U.S. military. This article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it. COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US. https://t.co/LPanIo40MR — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) March 13, 2020  He offered no evidence to support his allegation although Quartz noted the articles Zhao is pushing were created by Global Research, a firm founded by “a Canadian economist who has espoused conspiracy theories linked to the H1N1 swine flu epidemic and 9/11 in the past.” Quartz also noted the irony of Zhao pushing this ugly rumor on Twitter, a platform long ago banned by the Chinese government, which puts on a great show of using its immense censorship apparatus to halt the spread of scurrilous “rumors” and “misinformation.” For his part, Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak. His comments come as Iran has over 20,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,556 reported deaths. Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus, as Breitbart News reported. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) praised Beijing’s response to the novel coronavirus in line with Chinese propagandists, at one point denying human-to-human transmission was taking place as the deadly and highly contagious disease spiraled out of control inside the communist country. WHO Twitter messages from January and February show that the United Nations body was spreading Chinese propaganda. Health officials detected the first case of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on November 17 in Wuhan, China. Communist officials in China hid the extent of the coronavirus outbreak during the early stages of the epidemic, jailing and silencing whistleblowers, a move that allowed the virus to gain a firm hold. The ruling communist party, however, has hailed the recent slowdown of the outbreak as a sign of the superiority of its authoritarian political system. A study published earlier this month by the University of Southampton, determined that China could have prevented 95 percent of the coronavirus infections plaguing the globe if Beijing had listened to the doctor whistleblowers in Wuhan about the seriousness of the disease instead of silencing and punishing them for speaking out. “At critical moments, officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment,” the New York Times acknowledged in early February. China has refused to apologize for its mishandling of the outbreak during its initial phase. Meanwhile, it appears that the WHO has been covering for the ruling communist party in China. On January 14, the day before the first case to reach the United States reportedly flew from Wuhan to Seattle, Washington, the WHO denied that the disease was spreading through human-to-human transmission. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel [coronavirus] identified in [Wuhan],” the WHO wrote on Twitter.

""But there is still a lot we don’t know.

Dr. Tedros told reporters that day: Too much has been written & said about my praise for [China]. I have given credit where it’s due & I will continue to do that, as I would for any country that fights an outbreak aggressively at its source to protect its own people & the world, even at a great cost to itself. “Too much has been written & said about my praise for 🇳.I have given credit where it’s due & I will continue to do that, as I would for any country that fights an outbreak aggressively at its source to protect its own people & the 🌎, even at great cost to itself”-@DrTedros — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) February 15, 2020  Echoing false Chinese communist party statements, the WHO tweeted on February 21 that Dr. Tedros had claimed that China’s handling of the coronavirus gave the rest of the world “a fighting chance of containing the spread of the coronavirus.” ""The measures #China & other countries have taken have given us a fighting chance of containing the spread of the #coronavirus.  We call on all countries to continue their containment measures, while preparing for community transmission if it occurs""-@DrTedros #COVID19 — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) February 21, 2020  Although coronavirus spread from China to the rest of the world, the WHO suggested earlier this year that Beijing contained the disease. “This [coronavirus] is not influenza. With the right measures, it can be contained. That is one of the key messages from [China],” the WHO Twitter account quoted its Dr. Tedros as telling reporters on February 27. ""But this #coronavirus is not influenza. With the right measures, it can be contained. That is one of the key messages from #China. The evidence we have is that there does not appear to be widespread community transmission""-@DrTedros #COVID19 — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) February 27, 2020  Throughout the outbreak, there have been more cases in China than anywhere else in the world, making the communist country the epicenter of the global pandemic. Nevertheless, the WHO repeatedly claimed in February that new cases were on a downward spiral. On March 13, the U.S. government summoned the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, to the State Department to protest Beijing’s suggestion that the American military brought the coronavirus to China. Trump administration officials have lambasted China’s propaganda effort to reframe the coronavirus outbreak as a triumph for communism now that new cases in the country have allegedly begun to drop. According to the WHO, calling the disease the “Chinese coronavirus” could lead to the stigmatization of Asian groups and “potentially” make them sicker. Mainstream media outlets in the United States and the Chinese government have parroted similar claims, saying that calling the disease the “Chinese coronavirus” is racist. The WHO tweeted on February 25: Stigma occurs when people negatively associate an infectious disease with a specific population. This means that people are being labeled, stereotyped, separated and/or experience loss of status and discrimination because of a potential negative affiliation with [COVID-19].

At a January 28 meeting with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, the WHO director reportedly offered effusive praise for Beijing’s transparency and management of the coronavirus outbreak in late January, even though China initially tried to hide the epidemic from its public and the rest of the globe as the disease spread. Dr. Tedros also blasted other governments, like the United States, that tried to prevent the outbreak from spreading even further beyond China’s borders by suspending travel to and from the country. This month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, proclaimed that the coronavirus outbreak would be “worse” if U.S. President Donald Trump had not implemented travel bans on China early this year. The WHO director served as health minister in Ethiopia, which has a Marxist past. China is currently the largest foreign investor in the African country. Communist China is now the second-biggest donor to the United Nation’s regular budget after the United States. As such, Beijing holds considerable sway over the WHO, a U.N. entity. Perhaps one of the most glaring examples of the influence Beijing holds over the WHO is its success in blocking Taiwan’s access to the body, a position that could devastate the Taiwanese people as coronavirus continues to spread. Although China does not control Taiwan, it claims the island as part of its territory.",WHO Spread False Chinese Government Propaganda: Coronavirus Not Contagious Among Humans,2020-03-22,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/22/who-covers-for-china-amid-virus-outbreak-not-contagious-among-humans/,Breitbart
"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that recently President Donald Trump’s public messaging on the coronavirus pandemic has improved. Host Chuck Todd asked, “Is the role that President Trump has been playing at the briefings — do you believe that the public role the president has been playing has been helpful to this or do you believe he needs to take a step back and let the task force lead this response?” Toomey said, “Well, you know, Chuck, I think many have struggled to understand this and think about this. It’s completely unprecedented. I think in many ways, the president has stepped back. We hear vice president pence has done a great job pulling together all of the different agencies and branches of government and dealing at the different levels. I think Dr. Fauci has done a fantastic job helping people to understand what’s happening here. I also think many other folks in the administration have been absolutely terrific, from Seema Verma to Alex Azar and others. So I think the administration as a whole is responding well.” Todd asked, “Do you think the president has sort of gotten in the way of that at times?” Toomey said, “Look, I mean, his message has — it changed as our understanding of this has changed.

"Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D-IL) said states were having to compete with each other to get personal protective equipment for health care workers during the coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker said, “We just, just got a call this morning before I went on the air that we’re going to receive another shipment of PPE later today or tomorrow from FEMA, but it’s a fraction, still, of what we’ve requested. We need millions of masks and hundreds of thousands of gowns and gloves and the rest. And unfortunately, we’re getting still just a fraction of that. So we’re out on the open market, competing for these items that we so badly need and we’re succeeding in some ways. But we still need more. I’ve got people on the phones, working the phones, calling across the world, frankly, to get this stuff shipped to Illinois.” Host Jake Tapper asked, “That seems kind of a weird way to do it, you competing with Governor Newsom of California, competing with Governor Cuomo of New York. That doesn’t seem a very efficient way, not to mention thrifty way, to get these supplies as soon as possible.” Pritzker said, “That’s correct. We’re all competing against each other. This should have been a coordinated effort by the federal government. And the National Defense Authorization that the president has to essentially push this manufacturing really hasn’t gone into effect in any way. And so, yes, we’re competing against each other.

"America’s increasingly unstable and dangerous establishment media are calling for a full blackout of President Trump’s daily coronavirus press conferences. Think about that for a moment… For the first time since World War II, for the first time in nearly 80 years, Americans have no idea what their country will look like a year from now, and the corporate media want to impose a full blackout on the daily briefings the American president is making to the American people. There’s a lot of jokes out there about the hypocrisy of how this demand is coming from the same media that had a tantrum over the White House canceling the daily press briefings. But this time we’re talking about something so much more than hypocrisy. We are currently in the middle of global pandemic, a state of siege that, in just two weeks, has shut down our economy and locked many of us up in our homes, either by government decree of just plain old fear, and… In a time of national crisis, the left-wing fascists in the media want to use their corporate monopoly to put a stop to the president of the United States communicating directly with the American people who elected him. Please go back and read that sentence again. Even if you do, here it is again… In a time of national crisis, the left-wing fascists in the media want to use their corporate monopoly to put a stop to the president of the United States communicating directly with the American people who elected him. Maybe we’re so used to media tantrums, to their childish and hyper-partisan behavior, that this anti-American power grab just sounds like just another tantrum, but it’s not… Not even close. There are people out there, people taken seriously by the establishment as Thought Leaders, who, during an unprecedented crisis, want — this is not an exaggeration — to stop the president of the United States from communicating with the United States. One of the chief cheerleaders cheerleading for his unprecedented corporate power grab works for a news outlet that just adopted the slogan, “Democracy dies in darkness.” Margaret Sullivan is a media columnist for the far-left Washington Post: The media must stop live-broadcasting Trump’s dangerous, destructive coronavirus briefings. My column https://t.co/nIs5L051zq — Margaret Sullivan (@Sulliview) March 21, 2020  And what she’s calling for is worse than a total blackout on Trump’s ability to communicate with us.  She then wants a handful of these multinational media corporations to — again, this is not an exaggeration — pick and choose the information from the president that Americans will be allowed to hear. “Radical change is necessary. The cable networks and other news organizations that are taking the president’s briefings as live feeds should stop doing so,” she writes, before getting to the rub… “Should they cover the news that’s produced in them? Of course. Thoroughly and relentlessly — with context and fact-checking built in to every step and every stage.” In other words, CORPORATIONS WILL DECIDE WHAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW, NOT THE PUBLIC’S ELECTED PRESIDENT! It is no exaggeration to say that this is exactly like something right out of a dystopian movie where large corporations have taken over … everything. The Washington Post is owned by no less than Jeff Bezos, the man who owns Amazon.com, which is one of the most powerful and disruptive multinational corporations the world has ever seen. What’s more — and this is important — Amazon is a corporation that stands to exponentially expand its already vast wealth, power, and influence the more the American people are afraid to go outside, to go to the store. Good God! Naturally, the Washington Post is not alone. The calls to blackout Trump’s ability to communicate directly with the country are coming from the Atlantic, NBC News, the Boston Globe, the Nation, former Obama officials, and naturally CNN’s Brian Stelter retweeted Sullivan’s piece out to the world. If that’s not frightening enough, the whole idea apparently began with Jay Rosen, a so-called NYU journalism professor. And it’s not just corporate greed powering this frightening call to blacklist the American president. Let me tell you this… It is no accident this insidious and un-American idea arrived the day after a number of polls showed a clear majority of the public approving of Trump’s handling of the Wuhan virus. As those polls were released, can you imagine the rage and impotent frustration throughout every corporate newsroom in New York and D.C. as reality once again proved the bubbled media have lost their ability to move the needle of public opinion? For the past three weeks, the corporate media have been united in launching a legion of coronavirus lies at Trump, all in the hopes of turning the Chinese virus into “Trump’s Katrina,” only to watch all that effort, hope, and malevolence meet a Trump approval rating of 55 percent. So of course these utterly deranged, embittered, and fascist monsters want to stop the president from communicating with the public. Never forget that the media are a cult. They all think, talk, and believe exactly alike, and when their sacramental belief in themselves is threatened, they become nothing less than unstable and dangerous.

"Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D-IL) said there was “no doubt that the economy is being significantly harmed by the delays,” referring to his administration’s response to coronavirus pandemic. Host Jake Tapper asked, “Let’s talk about how to save the people or help the people whose livelihoods are being threatened if not destroyed. Lawmakers here in D.C. are right now scrambling to pass this unprecedented $1.7 trillion aid package to help the American economy. One of the last sticking points is whether to spend more sending checks directly to members of the public or to put that money into state unemployment programs for the states to distribute. What would you like?” Pritzker said, “Well, look, we’re going to have to do a lot. There’s no doubt that the economy is being significantly harmed by the delays that the federal government. You know, had during January and February, getting going dealing with this. That’s why we’ve all had to go on stay-at-home orders or keeping kids at home, closing bars and restaurants, and so on. So what would I like? First, we’ve got to fund unemployment. There’s no question about that. And the federal government needs to step up. It appears to be stepping up on that. As far as sending checks to individuals, I certainly think that that should be, you know, means-tested. There’s no reason to send a check to Michael Bloomberg, you know, for $1,000. So if that’s something the federal government decides to do, fine. But there’s another thing that isn’t being talked about. We’re having to spend money to do things that are frankly the job of the federal government. But I’m doing it, across the country our budgets will be slammed, our revenues are going down, no doubt precipitously and our spending has to go up because we’re saving people’s lives and we’re trying to at least put some money in their pockets. So we need help. We would like block grants to the states.

There are not enough face masks, gloves, ventilators, hospital beds to get us through this. Many hospitals are already at capacity or are approaching capacity.

Carlton and United Breweries, whose major brewery is in Abbotsford, Melbourne, wants the Victorian state government to include breweries in the “essential services” that remain open as the country experienced a run on liquor stores Sunday as buyers panicked and stormed outlets to buy as much alcohol as they could. “Carlton & United Breweries, Australia’s largest brewer, is greatly concerned about no beer being available in Australia for at least three months if beer is not given exempt status, and what this would mean for tens of thousands of jobs,” a spokesman told the Australian newspaper.

"Actor George Takei is taking issue with President Trump referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” contending that the phrase is “sending a signal to the haters in his constituency.” The Star Trek actor, in a Saturday appearance on the left-wing network MSNBC, said that the president’s decision to refer to the coronavirus — which originated in Wuhan, China — as the “Chinese virus” sends “a cold chill throughout the Asian-American community” and added that Trump is “sending a signal to the haters in his constituency, and there are plenty of them there.”  Takei provided a number of examples, including an incident shared by NYPD’s hate crimes unit depicting a man attacking a woman wearing a face mask in the Chinatown subway station in February. A witness alleged hearing the man use the words “diseased bitch.” Takei also cited the lynchings of 20 Chinese men in the central plaza of Los Angeles in 1870s, as well the internment of Japanese-Americans under Democrat President Franklin D. Roosevelt. “So we have this history. We want the term to be eliminated completely, but that sycophant Mike Pompeo used it publicly as well,” he added, asking Trump to “not be a participant” in the coronavirus tasks force briefings. Indeed, Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have referred to the virus as either the “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus” — a decision Trump has repeatedly defended. “I have to call it where it came from, it did come from China, so I think it’s a very accurate term,” Trump told reporters at a coronavirus press conference last week. Takei, however, put his own spin on the virus, declaring in a tweet on Saturday that it “acts just like Trump.” He also used the hashtag #TrumpVirus. “The coronavirus acts just like Trump. It gains a foothold and builds on ignorance. It grows because people don’t want to listen to science and the experts,” he said. “It shuts down our borders and cuts us off from each other.

"Mayor Eric Garcetti is going ahead with a plan to move thousands of homeless people in Los Angeles into recreation centers in residential neighborhoods as part of the city’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Rumors have been circulating among residents, and were confirmed on Saturday by the L.A. Times: Mayor Eric Garcetti’s plan for transforming 42 recreation centers into homeless shelters got its start on Friday, with city crews bringing in supplies, spacing cots and laying tarp on gymnasium floors. The initiative is part of a larger strategy to blunt the spread of the novel coronavirus among the city’s most vulnerable residents. … At each site, the city will provide workers with protective equipment, including coveralls, face masks and gloves, said Ashley Rodriguez, spokeswoman for the Department of Recreation and Parks. Those who move in will receive socks, blankets and personal hygiene kits, she said. … At a special meeting of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority commission on Thursday, housing task force chief Amy Perkins said the new shelters were being limited to about 80% of their capacity to maintain proper spacing, as recommended by public health officials. Beds are expected to be 6½ feet apart.   Garcetti’s approach fits with the policy set by Governor Gavin Newsom, who has said he would like all of the state’s homeless to be moved indoors during the pandemic. Other cities have decided to leave homeless people out in the open air, where they can maintain a social distance, while still working to provide other forms of assistance. But in Los Angeles, where many homeless people live in informal encampments, there appears to be a fear that homeless people will be exposed to the virus more readily. The San Francisco Chronicle, citing federal officials not authorized to speak, reported that “they’re finding it’s safer to leave homeless camps outside in the open air, with proper spacing and sanitation facilities, than to move people into cramped settings indoors.” It is not clear what, if any, consultation with local communities took place before the decision to use recreation centers to house the homeless. It is also not clear whether best public health practice is informing this decision. One local community leader, who did not want to be quoted directly, said the recreation centers should be used to provide hospital space for local residents. Breitbart News has obtained a list, which has yet to be confirmed, of all of the recreation centers where Garcetti plans to house homeless people during the coronavirus pandemic. Questions remain about whether homeless people would be more prone to infecting each other in the shelters, and whether they might pose a risk for the surrounding communities, as well as where the homeless would go once the pandemic ended. A request for comment from the mayor’s office has not yet received a reply. Both Garcetti and Newsom have come under severe criticism for the explosion in the state’s homeless population over the past several years. A federal report last year said that California was “entirely” responsible for the growth of the homeless population nationwide, and the homeless population in Los Angeles alone soared to nearly 60,000.

"Chloroquine has yet to be proven safe or effective as a treatment for coronavirus infection, noted Dr. Irwin Redlener, pediatrician and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, during Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Hayward asked about ongoing research into treatments for coronavirus infection. “There are two categories [of treatment],” replied Redlener. “One is the category of the vaccine, which eventually is going to be what saves us. We’re going to have a vaccine at some point, unfortunately a year and a half from now, hopefully, and we’ll have a vaccine that’ll actually be effective in preventing people from getting this virus, and then whatever that piece is that deals with the coronavirus will added to our annual flu shots, and hopefully that will have a huge effect.” Redlener continued, “In the meantime, we need to be fast-tracking the development of specific medications. you know, if somebody comes down with the regular seasonal flu and it’s caught early, the doctor may prescribe something called Tamiflu, which is an antiviral agent which does a pretty good job of treating that influenza. We don’t have the equivalent now for coronavirus, but there are well over a hundred labs in the United States working on every conceivable option here, and there are two categories of that.” Redlener added, “One is new drugs that we need to develop and people are hard at work on that. The second is. do we have drugs around like Chloroquine that can be used safely to treat people, and right now, unfortunately, in spite of what the president said — the president said Chloroquine may be the answer, but about five seconds later Dr. Fauci got up and said not so fast, because we don’t know that it’s effective, and we don’t even know whether it’s safe. Any of evidence that we have is very anecdotal, and we can’t have doctors just prescribing it, because it may actually be very unsafe for these conditions.”   LISTEN:  Redlener warned of widespread misinformation on the Internet regarding coronavirus treatments. “A lot of stuff is going to be on social media and on the Internet that we just can’t depend on,” he said, maintaining that government and industry are coordinating effectively towards identifying and developments coronavirus treatments. “There’s nobody holding back on any reasonable idea,” he added. Verifiable studies must be be conducted on proposes treatments to ensure efficacy and safety, Redlener noted. “If we don’t have that, we’re completely flying in the dark and potentially exposing people to a lot of a lot of real dangers,” he said, recalling an illustrative anecdote of harm caused by negligent circumvention of due diligence in research. “Right after 9/11, there were concerns that … if we went into Iraq, that Iraqi agents contaminated with smallpox were going to come into the U.S. and cause havoc with a smallpox epidemic that they would cause deliberately,” Redlener stated,” so the government came out with a plan. … The plan was to vaccinate — with the smallpox vaccine — 500,000 American healthcare workers, and then if it was safe, the rest of the population. So it made sense, and they started the inoculations, and a large number of people developed acute heart disease and there were several deaths.” Redlener concluded, “We don’t want to do more harm than good, even though these feel like desperate times, and certainly we’re in a major crisis. I think we have to be very careful about leaping into the great unknown here with a drug that’s not proven safe and effective for the coronavirus. I don’t mean to be grim here.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

"In a series of leaked emails, Swedish experts slammed the Public Health Authority and state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell for his and the government’s initial approach to the coronavirus pandemic. While the government has previously been criticised by some for underestimating the Chinese virus, the leaked emails show experts like chief physician and professor at Umeå University at the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Virology, Fredrik Elgh angered over the government’s response. “I am deeply concerned about the development. I would rather Stockholm was quarantined. We are almost the only country in the world that does not take everything we can to quell the infection. This is bloody serious,” Elgh told broadcaster SVT. Sweden Govt Says Coronavirus ‘Low Risk’ Will Not Screen Air Travelers https://t.co/WAdmtkoGXa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 26, 2020  Professor of epidemiology and public health science at Umeå University Joacim Rocklöv wrote in the email chain, “How many lives are they prepared to sacrifice so as not to shut down and risk greater impacts on the economy?” Anders Tegnell, meanwhile, defended himself and the government’s policies, claiming the situation was changing on a daily basis. Sweden has previously championed the “herd immunity” theory which was initially supported by the British government — but then rejected when it was pointed out the strategy could lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths. The Swedish economy is also predicted to take a major hit due to the virus, according to Kerstin Hessius, CEO of the Third AP Fund and former Deputy Governor, who said that unemployment in Sweden could rise to as much as 40 per cent. “It’s mass unemployment, it’s about 20 to 40 per cent unemployment. This means that there are very few businesses to go to. There is a risk even of all this money being blown out that we are getting hyperinflation along with we have no demand in the economy,” she said. The prediction comes after other experts predict that Scandinavian airline SAS will also require major help to prevent it from going under.

"Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci said President Donald Trump was only a “layperson” who has hope for success with existing drugs being successful in treating coronavirus. Fauci added he was “coming from it from a scientific standpoint.” Host Margaret Brennan asked, “You are the leading infectious disease expert in the U.S. government. You said this week that you differed from the president in his assessment that a combination of two drugs, Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin, could have the outcome he described to the public possibly could. Who is the president listening to? And do you see a concern here that those drugs could become, you know, basically over-prescribed and there could be a shortage who impact people who have persistent medical issues like Lupus who need those?” Fauci said, “There’s an issue here of where we’re coming from. The president has heard, as we all have heard, what I call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work. So what he was trying to do in the express was to hope that if they might work, Let’s try and push their usage. I, on the other side, have said I’m not disagreeing with the fact anecdotally they might work, but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work. So I was taking a purely medical-scientific standpoint, and the president was trying to bring hope to the people. I think there’s this issue of trying to separate the two of us. There isn’t fundamentally a difference there. He’s coming from it from a hope, layperson’s standpoint.

"Germany’s Angela Merkel has gone self-quarantined in her home after contact with a doctor infected by the Wuhan coronavirus. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Merkel’s government — at present a so-called “grand coalition” between her notionally centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the left-wing Social Democrats; roughly equivalent to a Tory-Labour or Republican-Democrat joint administration — told reporters that a doctor who administered a pneumococcal vaccine to the Chancellor on Friday had subsequently tested positive for the Chinese virus. Consequently, the 65-year-old politician has been quarantined, apparently voluntarily, where she will continue to work while receiving regular tests, according to CNBC. Merkel Claims Coronavirus Biggest Challenge to Germany Since World War II https://t.co/POXDf6ECxX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 19, 2020  The pandemic is accelerating rapidly in Germany, with over 90 dead and more than 20,000 confirmed infected — although the latter figure is in part due to the country’s relatively extensive testing. Chancellor Merkel had previously told the German people, in somewhat eyebrow-raising terms, that “since the Second World War there has been no challenge to our nation that has demanded such a degree of common and united action,” and that “It’s down to each and every one of us… to fight it.” The country has imposed some of the more draconian lockdown measures on the continent, with meetings of more than two people outside the home and workplace banned. This contrasts sharply with the situation in the United Kingdom, where schools and then pubs, cafes, gyms, and so on have been shut only in recent days, and social distancing “advised” — resulting in throngs of people continuing to cluster together in shops, parks, and public markets, apparently without consideration for the potential consequences. 10 Coronavirus Cases Confirmed by U.N.

"Never Trump stalwart, Iraq War advocate, and CNN analyst Max Boot has written an op-ed in in the Washington Post in which he claims that the coronavirus outbreak would not have been as bad if Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential election. “We couldn’t have avoided the coronavirus, but we could have ameliorated its effects,” he argues. Boot, a military historian, calls coronavirus “the most foreseeable disaster in history” — though he did not tweet about it until February, particularly after it came up in the Democrat debate Feb. 25 in South Carolina. (His only tweet about “coronavirus” prior to Feb. 26 references a report by an eighth grader.) In his op-ed, Boot claims that “Trump wasn’t paying attention” to intelligence reports. He fails to mention the travel ban on China that Trump imposed Jan. 31. (Boot has also mocked Trump’s travel ban on Europe, which was recommended and endorsed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease expert on the president’s coronavirus team.) Boot writes: Because of Trump’s negligence, the United States lost two months of response time — precious days that should have been used to test the population, produce more N95 masks and ventilators, and build new hospital beds. This past week, the Pentagon finally announced that a Navy hospital ship would be heading to New York — but it will take at least two weeks to get ready. Why wasn’t the deployment order given sooner? Even now, with the crisis upon us, Trump hesitates to use his full authority to order wartime production of ventilators needed to keep thousands of patients alive. Utterly lacking in empathy, Trump is incapable of rallying a shell-shocked nation. When asked on Friday, “What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?,” Trump launched into a tirade against the reporter who asked the question. Like the snake-oil salesman that he is, his version of reassurance is to tout miracle cures that have not been verified by medical science. Boot’s reference to the question about Americans who are “scared” neglects to mention that Trump only reacted to the reporter, NBC’s Peter Alexander, after the latter accused the president of giving “false hope” to Americans. The NBC White House correspondent later issued a statement accusing Trump of lacking empathy for Americans. At no point does Boot explain what Hillary Clinton would have done differently. He simply asserts that she is “a sane, sensible adult” — i.e. unlike Trump. Read Boot’s full op-ed here. Joel B.

"Hawaii’s Gov. David Ige issued a mandatory 14-day quarantine Saturday for people arriving or returning to the state, to help curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Saturday, Ige posted the announcement on his Twitter page along with the order’s details. MARCH 21, 2020: Today I issued a second supplemental emergency proclamation (https://t.co/nCAmi6Jh8f) ordering ALL individuals, both residents and visitors, arriving or returning to the State of Hawaiʻi to a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine. #COVID19 #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/FQczZ4d0J9 — Governor David Ige (@GovHawaii) March 22, 2020  The mandate is the first such action in the nation, according to a press release from the governor’s office. “With the majority of Hawaiʻi’s COVID-19 cases linked to travel, it is critical that we further mitigate the spread of the virus by both residents and visitors who are coming from out-of-state,” Ige said, adding, “This plan was developed in collaboration with our county mayors and Hawaiʻi’s business, community and visitor industry leaders.” The order requires those traveling through the state’s airports to proceed directly to a quarantine location identified and affirmed by the individual upon arrival. Residents must quarantine themselves in their homes and visitors must stay inside their hotel rooms or rented lodgings. They may only leave their quarantine location for medical emergencies or to seek medical care. “Failure to follow this order is a misdemeanor and punishable by a maximum fine of $5,000, or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both. Enforcement will be handled by each of Hawaiʻi’s four counties,” the order read. Saturday, the state announced 11 new cases of the coronavirus, which brought the total number to 48, according to Hawaii News Now. When asked why he had not instituted a broader shutdown or shelter-in-place order, Ige said it was an option if the virus continued to spread. “Mandatory staying in your homes is an extreme measure that we may implement here. But it really is appropriate when there is widespread community spread of the virus,” he commented. However, Ige added that it was in everyone’s best interest to voluntarily self-isolate for the time being. “We can do that. We all need to take action that we have within our powers to self-isolate,” he concluded. The mandate is set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday.","Hawaii Orders Mandatory 14-Day Quarantine for Visitors, Returning Residents",2020-03-22,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/22/hawaii-orders-mandatory-14-day-quarantine-visitors-returning-residents/,Breitbart

"Italian police have begun using drones to spot gatherings of people who may be trying to avoid the nationwide quarantine, arresting those who violate government orders. Police have begun enforcing the quarantine, as many Italians have not obeyed lockdown orders. The Italian Interior Ministry reported earlier in the week that over 200,000 people had been controlled by the police and over 8,000 reported for violating movement restrictions. A total of 116,712 commercial enterprises were also inspected by police, with 195 business operators reported for violations and 29 businesses forced to suspend their activities, Italian newspaper Il Giornale reports. Drones have seen use in several regions of Italy, including Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy, which has seen the largest surge in both cases and deaths in the country. Police are said to be asking Italians various questions to prove they were outside for essential reasons, such as purchasing food, by asking for purchase receipts or the address of the supermarket or doctor they were travelling to.

"Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) accused President Donald Trump of not doing enough “proactively” to help slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in America. Host Joy Reid asked, “Let’s first talk about New Jersey, your home state. I have a headline here that says one testing site reached capacity, and it reached capacity 35 minutes after opening. The governor, Phil Murphy, issued stay at home orders for nearly all of the state’s 9 million residents. Can you give us the state of play in New Jersey, and from your point of view as a senator, are there enough tests available?” Booker said, “The short answer to are there enough tests is no. Our governor is doing an extraordinary job in getting these drive through testing centers up. The first one was up, and it was oversubscribed right away. But we have a few others that are online to come up very, very soon. Again, we are still doing nationwide, a fraction of the number of tests we need to do. A lot of this was a problem caused by this administration that they did not really do enough proactively to prepare this country, had mistakes, and bungles along the way.” He continued, “But a lot of our governors, particularly governor of New Jersey is doing extraordinary job making the best out of a bad situation and slowly catching up. New Jersey will see the number of tests being done continue to go up. One word of caution to all Americans, do not go get a test if there is no reason to get a test. If you’re showing no symptoms, and haven’t been around somebody that had the coronavirus, don’t clog our testing centers. One thing you might want to do before you go get tested is consult with your doctor to see if you need one, because what you do, if you go there, then you prevent others who might need a test and based on that result of that test we could be actually helping to bend this curve.

I heard your conversation with the man from FEMA — we need test kits because these numbers are informative to only to a certain extent. We know that COVID-19 has infected a lot more people than just those who are being tested and testing positive. And that’s why in order to make decisions, we really need better data. We’re all building the airplane as we fly it right now. We’re doing the best that we can. We’ll continue to be aggressive and continually monitoring what our next move. But we need the federal government to get us those test kits.” She continued, “We need clear directive and guidance from the federal government. Frankly, a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can, is — you know, we’ll do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” She added, “Had the federal government really started focusing when it became clear that the whole world was going to be confronting this, we would be in a stronger position right now.” She concluded, “Lives will be lost because we weren’t prepared. Our economy will struggle longer because we didn’t take this seriously as early enough as a country. And there are going to be consequences of that, but right now I’ve got to solve problems, and I need the federal government to help me make sure that I’ve got what we need for our frontline providers, in particular, but also ventilators for people that are going suffer.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Whitmer on Trump Coronavirus Response: ‘Lives Will Be Lost Because We Weren’t Prepared’,2020-03-22,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/22/whitmer-on-trump-coronavirus-response-lives-will-be-lost-because-we-werent-prepared/,Breitbart
"Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) said on “Fox News Sunday” that Republicans were to blame for an exemption in her order that allows places of worship to gather in groups of 50 or more during the coronavirus outbreak. Guest host John Roberts asked, “One thing that kind of puzzles me is that you have limited groups of people to 50 or fewer yet, there is an exemption for places of worship. Why would a place of worship be any less likely to transmit diseases in a larger gathering than another place?” Whitmer agreed, “It’s not. It’s not, and we’re discouraging people from gathering at all.” Roberts pressed, “So, why this exemption?” Whitmer said, “Well, you know, the separation of church and state, and the Republican legislature asked me to clarify that that’s an area that we don’t have the ability to enforce and control. We are encouraging people, though, do no congregate. Do not go to church on Sunday and sit next to people that could be spreading the COVID-19.

"The worldwide effort to find a way to halt the spread of the coronavirus is under way and Charles Chiu at the University of California, San Francisco, may play a vital role in understanding the virus so that it can be controlled and even eradicated. A professor of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Chiu’s work includes tracking mutations and the spread of infectious diseases and his efforts are now in high gear at his state of the art laboratory. “We will be running this 24 hours a day,” Chiu said in a San Francisco Chronicle report. “I see no reason why we can’t sequence the genomes of every case.” The Chronicle detailed this part of the battle against the virus: The new NextSeq 550 sequencing machine at UCSF’s clinical lab on Berry Street looks like a microwave with a computer keyboard, but to microbiologist Charles Chiu, it is the key to California’s fight against the deadliest, most invasive virus to strike humanity in decades. Chiu, 48, is director of the UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center and it was one of the first labs to sequence strains of the H1N1 influenza virus, which was connected to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, according to the Chronicle.  The report added that Chiu has also sequenced 2,000 unusual strains of HIV and strains of the Zika virus. Our genomic survey of #SARSCoV2  in northern CA shows no predominant SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating (yet) among the community, unlike in Washington State or elsewhere – supports extreme social distancing and travel restrictions to minimize further spread — Charles Chiu (@cychiu98) March 21, 2020  During this pandemic, Chiu has analyzed nine samples from more than 24 people who tested positive for the coronavirus and who were passengers on the Grand Princess cruise ship. “Those sequences belong in the same cluster as the infection in Washington state,” Chiu said. “They really suggest a link between Washington state and California.” The Chronicle report explained Chiu’s work:  Chiu said tracking the spread of the virus through genetics is possible because coronaviruses are known to have one to two mutations per month, allowing genomic sequencing to track a particular strain back to its origin. The rate of mutation in coronaviruses is much slower than it is with the influenza virus, which averages about eight to 10 mutations per month. The mutations are why it is impossible for humans to become immune to the flu, which comes back in a new form every year. Chiu used genomic sequencing to identify California’s first case of community transmission, which was a Solano County, California, woman who was infected by an unknown source. She and a Santa Clara County, California, woman who was subsequently diagnosed had not traveled any place where the coronavirus was known to have spread, and did not have contact with anyone who was infected. The Solano County woman transmitted the disease to two health care workers. Chiu discovered that the three of them had a strain that was different from the others he has documented. He speculates that it originated in China and was transmitted to just her by a traveler. “Perhaps by identifying that patient (and isolating her), we might have been able to stop that strain from multiplying,” Chiu said. “A separate strain seen nowhere else in the United States was also found in a San Benito County in a person who returned from a visit to China,” the Chronicle reported. “It’s quite different from what is going on in Washington state, where all the cases are related to that single strain,” Chiu said, adding that about 20 genomes have been sequenced in that state, all of which originated in China. Chui said he will analyze 30 positive samples already in the lab and then more than 200 more he will be getting from Santa Clara County on Monday, which will “dramatically increase” the amount of genetic knowledge about coronavirus. “Who knows what it will look like when we get the 200 samples,” he said. “We’re basically scrambling to keep up. The situation changes every day.” According to Johns Hopkins University and Medicine, 316,652 coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide, 13,598 have died and 94,176 have recovered. In the United States 26,997 cases have been confirmed, 346 have died,  and 176 have recovered.

Emanuel said, “The governors are no doubt are leading, but they’re doing it with one hand tied behind their back. At the local level, every one of us wants to lead but have the resources of the federal government. You can’t call in the Defense Act and then say I’m not going to turn on the switch here.” He added, “This is a time where character is revealed. And the president has actually not led, he’s been passive, he’s not taken control of the situation, and it runs against every instinct. You got to be forthright and honest where he’s trying to spin. You got to deal with the data, the science, and the facts rather than manipulate and withhold them.

"President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force will host a press briefing at the White House on Sunday. The press briefing begins at 5:00 p.m. EST The president and his team continue to talk about the fight to contain the spread of the virus as well as support Americans suffering the economic effects of the global pandemic. Media establishment reporters are expressing concerns about the shortage of medical equipment and masks after first pressing the administration on the number of available coronavirus tests and whether the president is racist for using the term “Chinese virus” to describe the threat. They have also criticized the president for voicing optimism about anti-viral drugs being used to treat the virus. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday New York will start implementing the trial drugs to treat Coronavirus after acquiring Hydroxychloroquine, Zithromax, and Chloroquine from the Federal Government. The trials begin on Tuesday. Many White House reporters at the briefings complain that the president is criticizing them at a time when the public needs to listen to them the most. But Trump believes that many “dishonest” journalists are trying to spread sensationalism. “This is a time to come together, but coming together is much harder when we have dishonest journalists,” he said on Friday. “It’s a very important profession that you’re in. It’s a profession that I think is incredible. I cherish it. But when people are dishonest, they truly do hurt our country.” Both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were tested and found negative for the disease, even though a member of Vice President Mike Pence’s staff has tested positive for the coronavirus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin continue to work on an unprecedented financial package to rescue the American economy during the widespread shutdown as a result of the virus.

"Many Americans across the country are turning to patriotism to find hope during the coronavirus outbreak. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) called on his constituents to rally around Old Glory during a Friday press conference. “We’ve been attacked by this virus. We have to pull together,” DeWine said, according to WOWK. “Fly that flag every single day.” DeWine told the media about the act of one 7-year-old girl. The governor said he received an email from the girl’s mother which said, “Mr. DeWine, we do not have an American flag to hang outside our home. Today after your news conference, my 7-year-old daughter made this flag for our house in honor of your request.” “I would like to thank 7-year-old Elaina in Radnor, Ohio for the beautiful flag,” DeWine said. Cleveland.com reported there have been “lots of flags” put up around northeast Ohio in response to DeWine’s call. Others have done similar acts.

So when he heard Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz on TV the other day urging people to put up an American flag in a show of Covid-19 inspired solidarity, he thought bigger than just his own lawn. Riccio on Thursday planted small flags in the front yards of every house on Kenton Road, a one-block street between Delaware Avenue and Delaware Road that runs into Kenmore West High School. “I was just trying to show that we’re unified, we’re all in this together,” 70-year-old Riccio told the paper.
Boy Scouts in Hamilton, Michigan, placed flags in front of area businesses. “You turn on the TV and people are talking about staying home, things shutting down, people are getting nervous,” scout master David Nevins told Fox 17. “There’s a lot of uncertainty and I think this is a way to make people feel better.” But not all are finding pride in America at this time. Slate contributor David Masciotra wrote: The United States of America is a weak country. All the flag-waving, patriotic speeches and obtuse declarations of superiority have long seemed overly conspicuous — and history has no sympathy for the delusional.

"Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) described President Donald Trump’s decision to implement travel bans on China and Europe during the coronavirus outbreak as “very significant,” offering his remarks in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak. Pollak invited Scott’s evaluation of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting Scott’s overseeing of hurricane disaster responses in his former capacity as Florida’s governor. “I appreciate the fact that [Donald Trump] shut down the border with China,” said Scott. “I appreciate the fact that he did the same thing with Europe.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Sunday suggested that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is hitting the United States “so hard” because the U.S. has “one of the worst health care systems in the developed world.” She attributed the increased hardships to “inequities of race and immigration status.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) featured Ocasio-Cortez, as well as her fellow “Squad” members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), in a virtual roundtable discussion on the coronavirus pandemic Sunday evening. The New York lawmaker listed several reasons she believes the pandemic is hitting the U.S. “so hard” and suggested that “inequities of race and immigration status” are worsening the crisis: The reason we are here and the reason this crisis is hitting us so hard is because we have one of the worst health care systems in the developed world. We pay less than a living wage to a shamefully large amount of workers in the United States. Paid sick leave is not guaranteed. “And we have to make sure that people have basic rights and — as well as labor rights,” she continued. “So all of these things are contributing factors as to why this is hitting us so hard.” “But then you take that economic piece and you layer on inequities of race and immigration status, and you see how things can get even worse,” the freshman lawmaker added. Ocasio-Cortez’s participation in Sanders’ virtual town hall followed a Sunday appearance on CNN where she called for the suspension of mortgage, rent, and debt payments and the expansion of unemployment benefits. “Two major economic actions we should take to stabilize working families,” she said in a tweet alongside a clip of her appearance on State of the Union: 1.

"The Hill reported Sunday that one of the reasons bipartisan support for a massive coronavirus stimulus package has fallen apart is, once again, because Democrats want the bill to prop up Planned Parenthood. According to the Hill: A Democratic aide said that the small business provision was drafted to exclude non-profits who receive Medicaid from being eligible for Small Business Administration assistance offered under the bill. That, according to the aide, would impact Planned Parenthood but also community health centers, rape crisis centers and disability service providers. Planned Parenthood is identified as a nonprofit, not a small business. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Sunday she will be moving ahead with her own emergency relief package and ended hopes for an immediate vote in the Senate to further assistance for the nation in the midst of the crisis caused by the virus that originated in China. Breitbart News reported: Senate Republicans and the White House have insisted that they will continue to push for the $1.6 trillion economic relief package, which would include $350 billion in support for small businesses and $250 billion for unemployment insurance. The package would also include direct cash payments to individuals around $1,200 per individual, with additional funds going to families with children. Politico also reported that Pelosi’s announcement is an indication she will not be simply taking up the Senate bill and moving it forward on a unanimous consent basis: That also means the House may be forced back into session, even though many lawmakers are concerned about the threat from the coronavirus and the difficulties in reaching Capitol Hill from their home districts. Fox News reported on the impasse: Democrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers — saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient. The Wall Street Journal‘s Kimberly Strassel also weighed in on the stalemate on Twitter: 1) The Senate bill is bipartisan; assembled with D input from Day One.

"Tennessee U.S. Senate candidate Amb. Bill Hagerty (R) on Saturday blasted China for its role in trying to hide information about the coronavirus that originated in its country and has now spread throughout the world and is hurting the global economy. “The Chinese have got to be held accountable for this,” said Bill Hagerty, who was President Trump’s ambassador to Japan, in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Saturday with host Breitbart News Political Editor Matthew Boyle. “They were the first country to experience, they have an obligation to the rest of the world to make this information available to us immediately and with clarity,” he said. “But what do they do? They tried to hide the data, they destroyed samples, they tried to punish the doctors who tried to mention it in the first case, and in all likelihood, they have severely underreported the cases that are present there.” He continued: They’re running a public relations campaign, not a public health campaign. And they put control of their Communist regime ahead of the lives of their citizens and by the way, ahead of the lives and the wellbeing of everybody else in the world now.

Hagerty called China’s attempts to now blame America for the coronavirus “beyond the pale.” “The thing that is most frustrating [is] them trying to turn the tables and trying to blame America now, saying that this virus was originated by America,” he said. “That’s just as farfetched as anyone could imagine.” But he said the worst thing is that China has been threatening to hold lifesaving pharmaceuticals from America, which has exposed the vulnerability of the U.S. supply chain. “I think it’s exposed the vulnerability of our supply chains, the fact that we are dependent on China for critical resources like acetaminophen and penicillin, things like that are manufactured — sole-sourced — there in China,” he said. “For them to threaten to withhold it, I think, has really made the point very clear: we’ve got to get our strategic supply chains out of China.” He said President Trump, since the beginning of his administration, has begun bringing supply chains home. First, he initiated a “deregulatory thrust” to improve the business climate in America, and then tax reform bringing corporate tax rates down to “something at least competitive” with the rest of the world. “Those steps automatically put the American economy on a global trajectory that was better than the rest of the world … companies began looking to put supply chains back in the U.S.,” he said. He said Trump has also acted aggressively to keep Chinese companies out of critical U.S. infrastructure such as its 5G networks that the U.S. energy grid and things like autonomous cars will be tied to. “Can you imagine having Chinese-sponsored companies, Chinese-subsidized companies embedded in our 5G system? That infrastructure is very strategic, and something that we’re going to have to protect. The president has taken very clear action to keep companies like Huawei out of the United States infrastructure,” he said. Hagerty said he worked very hard to get Japan, one of the world’s largest economies, to also block Huawei and other Chinese companies from embedding in its 5G infrastructure. He expressed confidence in America’s ability to get through the coronavirus crisis. “This is a tough challenge, but America is stronger than this. We will stand up, we have the capacity to do it, and we will demonstrate that capacity,” he said. “It’s certainly the case in Tennessee — people are locking arms and we are pulling together to address this.” Hagerty, who has been endorsed by Trump, also thanked Tennessee’s first responders in the coronavirus crisis. “Our first responders, our doctors, our nurses, the medical professionals … they are doing a great job here in Tennessee looking after hardworking Tennessee families and trying to keep us as healthy as we possibly can be.” For more information, visit www.teamhagerty.com.",Tennessee Senate Candidate Amb.

"Sunday on MSNBC’s “Velshi,” Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) discussed the idea of universal health care amid the coronavirus pandemic. Host Ali Velshi asked Carter, a pharmacist, if he would be “cool” admitting the United States should have a universal health care system in place. “Well, what I hope we don’t see is universal health care, is Medicare for All come about as a result of a crisis,” Carter replied. “I don’t want to see us have socialized medicine as a result of the crisis. And I certainly don’t want us to have socialism as a result of the crisis.” Velshi pointed out how universal healthcare is “not at all a liberal concept nor a “socialist concept,” and it works in many countries around the world. Carter responded by saying the concept “doesn’t work” no matter where it came from. “It’s a concept that doesn’t work,” the Republican from Georgia stated. “And all you have to do is look into those countries that have it right now, and you’ll see that they are not getting the type of healthcare that we get here in America. If you’re sick anywhere in the world where you want to be is the United States of America because we have the best healthcare system in the world. We have access to prescription medications that those countries that you speak of don’t have access to. That’s the kind of thing that we’re talking about here when we talk about socialized medicine when we talk about Medicare for All.” Velshi then challenged Carter after social distancing is over with to visit his home country of Canada and then tell him Canada does not have a better healthcare system than the United States.

"White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said brokers hoarding supplies to price gouge Americans will not be let off the hook during the Chinese coronavirus crisis. During a press conference on Sunday, Navarro gave a direct message to brokers who are allegedly hoarding tons of much-needed supplies to fight the coronavirus in attempts to price gouge. “I also get a lot of calls that are very disquieting. Brokers are offering millions of items, whether they are goggles, masks, or whatever, and you go through three different brokers, tracing to a warehouse in [Los Angeles] that’s allegedly got ten million masks and they want to charge you seven times what they cost,” Navarro said. “That’s price gouging.” “A message to the hoarders: If you’ve got any large quantities of materials that this country needs right now, get them to market or get them to us, we’ll pay you a fair price,” Navarro said. “But if you don’t do that, we’re going to come for you and make sure that doesn’t happen in this country.” Most recently, a pair of brothers in Tennessee donated 17,000 bottles of hand sanitizer that they had been allegedly hoarding, along with masks and cleansing wipes, in an attempt to price gouge Americans. The brothers are now under investigation. Likewise, Breitbart News’s Bob Price reported that in Texas, hoarders are continuing to price gouge Americans despite the threat of prosecution. In just a few days, more than 300 complaints of price gouging in Texas had been filed with the state. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Pence expressed there are “challenges” and “heartache ahead” in the fight to prevent the spread, but he said the United States is “up to the task” of stopping the deadly virus under President Donald Trump’s leadership. “America is up to to the task, and they have a president who knows that,” Pence told host Mark Levin. “Not that there aren’t challenges ahead, Mark, there are, and there’s heartache ahead. As we continue to roll out testing by the tens of thousands more tests done every day, we’ll learn of more cases, and sadly, we’ll learn of more loss of life. But President Trump from very early on has understood that the American people would come together around our response and that our state and local officials, our incredible health experts at the federal level, now empowering the American people, we’ll find our way through this.” Pence also said he is “inspired” by how Americans have responded to the guidelines put out to help combat the virus and helping their fellow countrymen amid the crisis. “I couldn’t be more proud to be an American to see the way the American people and American businesses are rising to the challenge. And I know we’ll get through this. And as the president says, we’ll get through this together,” he added.

Nine out of ten did not,” Pence said. The vice president said that any backlog of coronavirus tests will be finished at the end of the week, according to figures from commercial labs. He asked all labs to prioritize coronavirus tests for in-patient Americans. “We want people that have been checked into a hospital, that is being treated for what they suspect to be coronavirus, to receive those tests more quickly,” he said.

"President Donald Trump said Sunday at the White House that he is glad he is president during the coronavirus crisis despite losing billions of dollars. Donald Trump was asked by reporters during a White House press briefing if he had sold stocks during the crisis. “No, I don’t have stock,” Trump replied. “I own things.” He added that he did “not even think about” alternating any investments. Trump said that the question from the reporter was “nasty,” noting that it cost him billions of dollars to run for president. “It cost me billions of dollars to be president, and I am so happy I did it because who cares? I am really happy with the job that we’re doing, and i’m really glad that this team and me are here.” He recalled attending a charity event for the Robin Hood Foundation just after announcing his run for president when he was both booed and cheered upon arrival. Trump said that his wife Melania recalled that she had never heard him booed before. He noted that since he became president, people also began suing him, costing him a lot of money in lawsuits. “Everybody is suing me … I’m being sued all over the place,” he said. “And doing very well, but it’s unfair.” Trump reminded reporters how difficult it was for a wealthy person to run for president. “I think it’s very hard for rich people to run for office,” he said. “It’s far more costly; it’s just a very tough thing. But he repeated that he was glad he was president, despite the costs. “With all of that being said, I’m so glad I did it,” Trump said.

"During Sunday’s “The Cats Roundtable” on New York AM 970 radio, political commentator Dick Morris weighed in on the 2020 presidential election amid the coronavirus pandemic. Morris said the virus “overwhelmingly” flips the race in President Donald Trump’s favor over former Vice President Joe Biden because people are not thinking about any of the other issues the country faces. “This crisis completely changes the presidential race, overwhelmingly in Trump’s favor,” Morris told host John Catsimatidis before likening the outbreak to Hurricane Sandy, helping out former President Barack Obama’s reelection. He continued, “Trump has had a great performance as president, but it’s now being overcome and enhanced by a very good performance in dealing with the virus. All Trump has to do now is be a good president. All he has to do is to do his job as president, ride out this epidemic, succeed in containing it, and he’s home free.” Morris also suggested Trump has changed his style and is becoming “incredibly presidential.” “There’s something else that’s happening that is even more important: His style is changing. He’s no longer the gladiator, the warrior going to war with the other party putting down his opponents. … He’s a consensus figure speaking with gravity and somberness about the crisis and giving Americans every day the news they need to know. He’s becoming … incredibly presidential. And as such, the dislikes that people have of him, I think, are melting away.” The former Bill Clinton adviser went on to say Biden has become an “afterthought” in the race, adding he is “almost in the history books already.” “The other thing that’s happening is that there is no more oxygen left in the room for Joe Biden,” Morris added. “He’s going to get the Democratic nomination, but so what? He can’t say anything. He can’t campaign. He can’t attack Trump. He can’t talk about [coronavirus]. There is nothing left for him to say.

"Democrats blocked a coronavirus package on Sunday that would provide economic relief to businesses and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The Senate GOP package failed, with 47 votes in favor and 47 against, which fell 13 votes short of what was necessary to advance the legislation. An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package. “I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,” the Senate leader said on Sunday. McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.” “She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” he added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.” In contrast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blamed Republicans for advancing legislation without an agreement. Schumer said on the Senate floor: The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing. So who’s playing games? But our caucus is united to deliver a bill that addresses this health and economic crisis quickly and we’re committed to working in a bipartisan way to get it done. The National Republican Senatorial Committee slammed Senate Democrats for blocking the legislation. NRSC Communications Director said in a statement on Sunday: Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Senate Democrats allowed partisan fervor to thwart a critical coronavirus relief package while our country faces a crippling pandemic. DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home. Those same candidates should prove they aren’t beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats’ unthinkable decision to filibuster. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said in a statement on Sunday: ‪How pathetic. Tonight’s vote was not even on passing a bipartisan plan, it was merely to begin debating it. The American people are hurting, the clock is ticking, but Senate Democrats would rather cave to Speaker Pelosi’s eleventh-hour demands. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should worry more about getting relief to their constituents and less about the House Speaker’s partisan wish list. This cannot go another day. After congressional Republicans and Democrats were in the final stages of negotiating a long-term coronavirus package deal with the White House, Pelosi announced that House Democrats will move forward with their own bill. “From my standpoint, we’re apart,” she said earlier on Sunday.

"Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley raked in more than $256,000 as a member of the Boeing Board of Directors during her tenure before resigning last week. As Breitbart News reported, Haley issued a letter on March 16 to Boeing executives announcing her resignation. Haley said she could no longer serve on the board of directors as President Trump reviews bailing out the multinational corporation amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Haley joined the board of directors despite Boeing’s long history of corporate welfare. Boeing is already the second-largest beneficiary of Defense Department contracts. In 2017, Boeing noted that about 79 percent of its profits came from government contracts with the U.S. federal government. Likewise, Boeing saved about $1.1 billion thanks to tax cuts while simultaneously laying off 6,000 American workers in Washington state alone. Haley, according to Boeing’s 2019 financial statements, raked in about $256,322 from her time on the board of directors, which began April 29, 2019. (Boeing 2020 Proxy Statement) Haley’s compensation is about $112,000 more than the compensation Boeing has started giving to the families of 737 Max crash victims. Each 737 Max crash victim family is receiving less than $145,000 in compensation from Boeing, nearly half of what Haley earned in her time on the board of directors. The 737 Max scandal has plagued Boeing over the last couple of years. In 2018, two Boeing 737 Max flights crashed, leaving nearly 350 passengers dead, forcing the corporation to ground all 737 Max planes and stop production. Reports of internal Boeing emails, chronicled by Breitbart News’s Tom Ciccotta, have indicated that executives knew of the issues facing the 737 Max fleet as early as 2016. Similarly, a former Boeing manager has said he warned the corporation of the issues with the 737 Max fleet in 2018 before the two crashes occurred but that his concerns fell on deaf ears. A 2019 report detailed how Boeing outsourced American software jobs to mostly Indian foreign graduates for $9 an hour. In June 2019, reports stated that Boeing’s problems with its 737 Max fleet coincided with executives outsourcing U.S. software jobs to foreign workers through HCL Technologies Ltd. — an India-based outsourcing firm. In 2018, Boeing executives announced their plans to outsource a manufacturing plant to Bengaluru, India, where 3,000 Indian workers would be employed. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Multinational corporation 3M will manufacture 35 million much-needed respirator masks in the United States every month for Americans to help President Donald Trump’s administration fight the coronavirus. In the midst of the Wuhan, China-originated coronavirus crisis, 3M CEO Mike Roman announced that they will be manufacturing about 35 million N95 respirator masks a month — 90 percent of which will go to American healthcare workers who are in desperate need of medical supplies. “Since the initial COVID-19 outbreak, we’ve ramped up to maximum production levels of N95 respirator masks and doubled our global output to a rate of more than 1.1 billion per year, or nearly 100 million per month,” Roman said in a statement. “In the United States we are producing 35 million respirator masks per month; of these, more than 90% are now designated for healthcare workers, with the remaining deployed to other industries also critical in this pandemic, including energy, food and pharmaceutical companies.” Roman said more than half a million respirator masks are currently being delivered from the company’s South Dakota-based plant to highly affected cities like New York City and Seattle, Washington. The respirator masks are expected to arrive on March 23. “We are also ready to expedite additional shipments across the country,” Roman said. In the U.S., we are producing 35 million respirators per month. More than 500,000 respirators are on the  way to two of the more critically impacted areas, New York and Seattle, with arrivals expected starting tomorrow. Read full statement here: https://t.co/V0mmrjSCFG 3/3 — 3M (@3M) March 22, 2020  Roman thanked the Trump administration for expanding the PREP Act, which allows all N95 disposable respirator masks to be used in healthcare environments and has helped increase 3M’s distribution of the respirator masks to American healthcare workers. “We call for additional legislation to ensure all critically needed reusable respirator masks are equally available, which will help conserve the supply of N95s,” Roman requested.

"U.S. stock futures smashed into “limit down” trading curbs in their first hour of trading Sunday night after Democrat pushed back against economic rescue measures on Capitol Hill. Futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell by 5 percent, triggering downside limits that prevent the contracts from trading 5 percent below the prior close. The limits are intended to prevent panicked sell-off and ensure orderly markets but they can obscure market signals by concealing selling pressure until the opening at 9:30 a.m. The Nasdaq was down by almost 5 percent. Traders appeared to be reacting to developments in Washington, D.C. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, said Sunday afternoon that she rejected the idea of working on the plan in the U.S. Senate supported by Republicans and the White House. She said she would instead move forward with her own economic package. The Senate on Sunday night failed to advance its economic rescue bill, with lawmakers voting 47 to 47 on a procedural vote that required 60 votes to move the bill forward. Five Senators were not present to cast votes because they are self-quarantined due to coronavirus concerns. Democrats have accused Republicans of rushing the process. Roll Call reported: The vote had been delayed by three hours Sunday amid deepening rifts over the massive economic stimulus package, with Democrats expressing frustration that GOP leaders were rushing on a measure that they said didn’t do enough to help workers and was too generous toward corporate interests. Few outside of Washington view efforts to pass an economic rescue package as rushed.

"The House coronavirus spending bill allows roughly 500,000 college graduate visa-workers from China, India, and elsewhere to stay in their U.S. jobs, regardless of job losses by American graduates in the economic meltdown, according to a lobby group for H-1B workers. The measure would prevent U.S. graduates from getting hundreds of thousands of college-grade jobs as the foreign workers’ visas expire — despite the colossal job losses being caused by China’s Wuhan virus. The rule would even allow foreign H-1B workers who are fired to stay and compete for any jobs that come open during the epidemic. “We have been working behind the scenes to address the immediate concerns of a lot of immigrants,” claimed the Facebook post by Immigration Voice, which was posted around 5.oo PM EST.  The group continued: We take some solace to report, Immigration Voice has convinced the House to include a provision in the upcoming stimulus bill which says – in light of the indefinite closing of USCIS offices and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, all existing lawful immigration statuses and EADs [Employment Authortization Documents] will be automatically extended for 1 year from the date the legislation is enacted. As per the current language, if you have an H4 EAD, it will be extended for a year. If you have an H-1B about to expire, it will be renewed and you can remain here even if furloughed until the crisis is over. … We need the Senate to agree to add the language into its stimulus in order for the doctors and other critical care workers we have in our community to be able to treat patients and go to work without fear of losing their status if they die. Please call your Senators and make sure they understand the importance of this provision and of the work you do. Immigration Voice claims to be an independent group, but reportedly works closely with Compete America, an advocacy group formed by the nation’s major tech companies, nearly all of whom employees large blocs of Indian and Chinese visa-workers in jobs that could be filled by young American graduates.  The coalition’s members include Facebook, Cisco Systems, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Google, Microsoft, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The Immigration Voice claim is unproven, but it matches a new demand from FWD.us, an advocacy group of West Coast investors. The group said the federal government should automatically extend visa permits for the nation’s population of foreign visa workers amid the coronavirus epidemic. The list of “Policy Priorities … that Congress & Elected Officials must take,” was posted March 21 by the group’s director Todd Schulte, and it said: We are in a global pandemic. The third week of March has seen more job loss than any other in our history and more businesses closed … [the Government should] Automatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020. A policy of automatic renewal would keep roughly 500,000 foreign college-level visa-workers on U.S. company payrolls by the end of 2020, even as many thousands of American graduates are losing jobs amid the economic meltdown caused by China’s Wuhan virus. But if President Donald Trump used his emergency powers to not renew the work visas, he would open up several hundred thousand good jobs for the American college graduates who are likely to vote in 2020. Meanwhile, agency officials are moving ahead with plans to import 85,000 new H-1B workers in 2020. Breitbart News asked the Department of Homeland Security if the agency is considering curbs on the 2020 award of H-1B visas because of the coronavirus disaster. “No changes at this time,” a spokesman responded on March 19. Donald Trump's DHS has taken two steps to speed the delivery of 86,000 foreign graduates into American grads' jobs:Even as many US white-collars are about to be laid off by US managers & Indian subcontractors.Despite Trump's 2016 campaign promise. https://t.co/rsgZeHClla — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 22, 2020  U.S.-based companies employ a population of roughly 1.5 million college-graduate visa workers in the United States. The FWD.us lobby group was formed by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and other West Coast investors to help push the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill through Congress. The group was subsequently funded by a roster of investors and business chiefs, including top executives from Walmart, Google, and Microsoft. The investors strongly support mass immigration because it cuts companies’ labor costs and inflates consumer sales. Since the populist election of Donald Trump, the group’s members have tried to defend their supply of visa workers, and of legal immigrant workers, consumers, and renters. The group’s primary strategy is to shift the public debate away from visa-workers and legal immigration by pushing the media to provide sympathetic coverage to illegal workers, ‘DACA’ illegals, Central American migrants, New York illegals, and poor criminals. For example, the group’s call for automatic visa-worker extensions is buried in a press release urging common-sense measures to provide economic support to jobless Americans and small companies: We know that this crisis will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable in society, including those harmed and directly impacted by our broken immigration and criminal justice systems. … Provide zero-interest loan assistance to any small business who needs it and some targeted tax relief for others so they don’t fire their workforce. This means making sure restaurants, home health care providers — and not just big companies — can keep people paid and stay afloat. Expand unemployment insurance and safety net programs and benefits. This should include plans and emergency funds to cover child care and medical care, and specific support for those at the frontlines of this crisis. Release people from the public health disaster that are jails, detention centers, and prisons. Federal, state, and local officials should be looking for every opportunity to dramatically reduce incarcerated populations, who are at some of the highest risk. Automatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020. This should include DACA recipients who may no longer be able to renew because of the closure of USCIS offices and require an active DACA status to be eligible for protection from deportation and to be able to continue to legally work in the U.S. Many DACA recipients are healthcare workers on the front lines of this crisis. Provide immediate relief from debt collections, immigration enforcement, and eviction. Alongside the call for automatic renewal of visa workers, the investors’ group is also calling for “immediate relief … [from] immigration enforcement,” the release of many prisoners, and the renewal of work-permits for the roughly 600,000 migrants covered by President Barack Obama’s “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals’ quasi-amnesty.

Go to https://t.co/mC34ZjwFZX https://t.co/H6VzGF5kEC — Todd Schulte (@TheToddSchulte) March 22, 2020  A Breitbart News study showed the population of white-collar visas workers to be roughly 1.5 million. At least one-third of those workers — or 500,000 — have their visa status renewed each year The overall population of 1.5 million visa workers includes roughly 900,000 foreign workers on three-year H-1B visas, as well as roughly 300,000 foreign graduates on one-year visas. Two-thirds of the 1.5 million visa workers are Indians, while the Chinese workers providing the second-largest group. Company executives and “Human Resources” managers use the H-1B program to procure and promote blocs of compliant, disposable, lower-skill foreign college graduates for the many good jobs which are sought by qualified and eager U.S. graduates and mid-career professionals. The blocs of H-1B workers sometimes cost more than American professionals, partly because they are often less productive and innovative than American graduates. But U.S. managers prefer visa workers because they can be hired and fired as ‘gig workers’ via networks of coordinating subcontractors, such as Infosys, Tata, HCL, and other Indian companies. Also, the federal government rarely enforces routine workplace laws in H-1B workplaces. The government’s refusal to enforce the laws means the H-1Bs can be hired, fired, and abused by their bosses, most of whom are Indians who grew up in Indians’ own culture. These abuses include workplace intimidation, sexual discrimination, and unpaid overtime hours, Americans tell Breitbart News. The government inaction in H-1B workplaces also strips American graduates of routine workplace protections, including protections against commonplace discrimination because of their nationality. DoJ/EEOC do nothing as US & Indian execs trade US jobs to Indian #H1B workers, cutting Americans out of careers, homes & families.This trade choked innovation in Silicon-V, slammed  insurance & banking. #SenMikeLee & #S386 will expand it to healthcare https://t.co/qoENwyO6X7 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 9, 2020  Many brand-name American companies in the software, Internet, insurance sectors rely on these visa workers. Numerous American graduates report that native-born Americans are a rarity in most Silicon Valley companies, as well as in insurance and banking industries on both coasts. Each April, 85,000 H-1B visas are awarded to U.S. and Indian companies via a rushed application and lottery process managed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. An additional “cap-exempt” 15,000 H-1Bs are awarded throughout the year to non-profit employers at universities, research laboratories, and hospitals. Cap-exempt employers are allowed to hire as many H-1Bs as they wish. The current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for the Indian-based outsourcing industry. The group’s mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to extract salaries and wealth from the U.S. college-graduate class and to split the gains among both countries’ executives and investors, as well as with the visa workers. DHS on autopilot, says it will speed the award of 85,000 H-1B graduate visa-workers to US employers by barring corporate line-jumping via the 'premium processing' service.Meanwhile, myriad US grads will lose their jobs in April b/c of coronavirus. @S386https://t.co/LvhiwtqAbK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 19, 2020  Meanwhile, business groups are trying to expand the H-1B program. For example, activists are citing the coronavirus as an excuse for Congress to allow investors to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates for jobs in the healthcare sector. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is also pushing his S.386 bill to reward additional Indians if they take jobs from American graduates. Trump’s failure to set curbs on the H-1B program has angered many of the swing-voting university graduates who supported him in 2016. In March 2016, after much zig-zagging, Trump declared: The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions. In February 2020, a U.S. judge struck down the token H-1B curbs set by USCIS managers since Trump’s election. Govt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc. The Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence. It is a huge economic & career loss for US college grads.#S368 #H1B https://t.co/pqEW9yJ89c — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 17, 2020  Immigration reformers are calling for the cancellation of the 2020 H-1B awards amid the economic crash. American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption. In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher. Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries. The federal USCIS agency provides some data, including data about the uncapped OPT program, sometimes called the “Mini-H-1B.” The economic crash means the federal government must stop the inflow of H-1B workers so that sidelined American professionals can get jobs, a Florida-based American computer expert told Breibart News March 19. “Fiona” earned two college degrees in the early 2000s after she left the real estate industry following the 2007 collapse. Since then, she has worked a series of contract jobs, most recently at a seven-month stint at an insurance company run by an imported workforce of H-1B workers from India. She said her job ended when she was forced out by Indian managers, in part, because of her excellent performance reviews. She is in her 50s, has been unemployed for several months, and fears recruiters will blackball her if she speaks on the record. She told Breitbart News, “I’m not eligible for unemployment. So I have lived off my savings, and I’m living with my son. I’m still applying for jobs, but they’re very few and far between. I can’t relocate again because when they cut my contract job, I had to cut my lease off early, so now, my credit is bad. My lease history is bad. I can’t go and take the risks that I did before. I was getting ready to go and look for a minimum wage job until this coronavirus came here, you know. Come next month, you know what? I can’t pay my bills because I’ve gone for like eight months on my savings.” She added, “To be honest with you, I have given up on American companies. I have given up on being able to be hired by America because I’m American, and Americans don’t matter. And I’m sorry I’m going to get a little bit emotional here. … Americans don’t matter. I hear politicians, you know, saying, “Okay, you know what? We’re going to open our borders, and you can have free health…I don’t have health insurance. You know, Americans don’t matter. All that matters is foreign workers. All that matters is if the foreign individuals…I mean, it’s like we don’t matter. America doesn’t matter.” One traveler from China directly about 30 people with coronavirus in the Seattle area during January and Feb. No report yet on far those infections have spread onwards.

Officials clarified that activating the National Guard would provide important resources to governors, but that it was playing an assistant role in the fight against the virus. “I want you to understand, this is not martial law,” FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said.

"To paraphrase a former White House chief of staff, “Never let a pandemic go to waste.” Ex-President Barack Obama’s top policy enforcer offered his glint of wisdom at the height of the 2008 economic catastrophe that the U.S. is still digging out of today. “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” Rahm Emanuel said shortly after Mr. Obama was swept into office on rosy, glowing promises of “hope” and “change.” Treat every crisis the way they treat school shootings, which for them are merely opportunities to round up the lawful guns of law-abiding innocent taxpayers. This evil theorem is not to be confused with finding the silver lining in all things, good or bad. A great silver lining to the present Chinese pandemic, for example, is that all these quarantines and “social distancing” and “sheltering in place” means we get to spend huge amounts of unexpected new time with our families. Children are home from school. Sports are canceled. College students have vacated campuses. And young people have fled the big cities where they work. Trying times, to be sure. But also: How awesome is it to suddenly have all your kids back home bickering around the table like they are all still in grade school? You actually appreciate it in ways you failed the first time around. Another silver lining, for example, is that Americans who have for whatever reason failed to get properly armed are going back to gun stores in droves. Any excuse to harden home defenses is a good excuse. Of course, the central planners like Rahm Emanuel and his political minions see these long lines at gun stores as a terrifying turn. But then again, they don’t think much of American self-governance in the first place. There are other ways as well that we as a country must take full advantage of the Wuhan flu crisis. If nothing else, it has laid bare just how dangerous and deceitful an enemy the communist regime in China really is. They lie about everything. They make people disappear to cover up anything embarrassing. They spark wild conspiracies to muddle the truth about what actually caused this Chinese pandemic. Far more concerning is how deeply dependent American politicians have allowed our country to become on China. After decades of appeasement, America sits hostage to China for so much manufacturing of vital goods, including the very types of drugs required to protect American citizens from the crazy infectious diseases that spring from China’s dirty “wet markets” and wildlife trade. Hopefully, this current Chinese infection passes in short order and Americans can get back to their normal, healthy lives. But it is just as important that in the months and years to come, American politicians remember: This crisis has clearly shown how critical it is for us as a country to break our dependence on such a dishonest and dishonorable enemy. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com or @charleshurt on Twitter.","The Nuclear Option: Amid Pandemic, America  Held Hostage by China",2020-03-22,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/22/the-nuclear-option-amid-pandemic-america-held-hostage-by-china/,Breitbart

Europe is now considered by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be the epicentre of the virus, leading to economic and health crises across the continent. Here is the latest coronavirus news from countries across Europe: Spain: On Sunday, the death toll in Spain jumped by 30 per cent in a 24-hour period, bringing the total number of deaths from the coronavirus 1,720. The number of confirmed cases in the country rose by nearly 4,000 in the same time span, with at least 28,572 known cases of the virus, Bloomberg reports. The country is quickly trying to establish makeshift field hospitals as well as setting up quarantine zones in hotels for those displaying mild symptoms of the virus. Spain has also called on retired doctors and nurses to help with staff shortages in hospitals. “We must prepare ourselves emotionally and psychologically for very hard days ahead,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said, as the country is considering extending its fifteen-day lockdown. Italy: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that all non-essential production will be halted in Italy, saying that the country is facing the gravest crisis since the Second World War. “The decision taken by the government is to close down all productive activity throughout the territory that is not strictly necessary, crucial, indispensable, to guarantee us essential goods and services,” Conte said in comments reported by the Guardian. Only supermarkets, pharmacies and other essential businesses will be permitted to stay open as the country continues its nation-wide lockdown.

Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday that New York State has acquired 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine to implement drug trials to treat patients with coronavirus, which will begin on Tuesday. “We’re also implementing the trial drug,” Cuomo said: We have secured 70,000 hydrocloroquin; 10,000 zithromax from the federal government. I want to thank the FDA for moving very expeditiously to get us this supply. The President ordered the FDA to move and the FDA moved. We’re going to get the supply and the trial will start this Tuesday. The President is optimistic about these drugs and we are all optimistic that it could work. I’ve spoken with a number of health officials and there is a good basis to believe that they could work. Some health officials point to Africa, which has a very low infection rate and there’s a theory that because they’re taking these anti-malaria drugs in Africa, it may actually be one of the reasons why the infection rate is low in Africa. We don’t know, but let’s find out and let’s find out quickly. And I agree with the President on that and we’re going to start and we’re going to start Tuesday. New York City and Westchester County, New York are now the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. As of 10:00 p.m. eastern on Sunday, New York State has reported 15,168 cases. The majority of those cases–more than 10,900–are in New York City and Westchester County. Nationwide, 33,546 cases of coronavirus have been reported as of 10:00 p.m. eastern on Sunday, according to the Worldometers website. The death toll in the United States as of 10:00 p.m. eastern on Sunday is now 419, with 114 of those in New York State, 95 in Washington State, and 34 in California. At a press conference on Thursday President Trump said chloroquine looked promising as a treament for coronavirus, and instructed the Food and Drug Administration to move quickly to move it into clinical testing: Later that day, the FDA issued a statement about chloroquine: President Trump has directed the FDA to continue its work with the public and private sector to ensure the availability of potentially safe and effective life-saving drugs to patients who are in desperate need, including those infected with COVID-19. with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19. On Friday, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told NPR that doctors have the ability to write prescriptions for chloroquine today, because it has been approved for the treatment of malaria, even though clinical trials have not been completed that could lead to its approval for treatment of coronavirus: And this is an individual doctor decision. We’ll be providing — not we FDA — but the CDC will be providing some guidance about that with respect to potential therapeutic options. But you’re right. I mean, absolutely. And this [chloroquine] is a drug that’s available to physicians to prescribe now. . . What I’m saying is an individual doctor has to incorporate the data to make the decision for their individual patients. And one of the ways we’re going to try to make this available on a more widespread basis is through this expanded access approach. . . So we’re working on [when that starts] now where obviously supply and availability of a drug is an issue. But there is an all-of-government approach on this. Critics of the president claimed his optimism about chloroquine was unwarranted, but two doctors writing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday said the drug “is showing promise” as a treatment for coronavirus: A flash of potential good news from the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic: A treatment is showing promise. Doctors in France, South Korea and the U.S. are using an antimalarial drug known as hydroxychloroquine with success. We are physicians treating patients with Covid-19, and the therapy appears to be making a difference. It isn’t a silver bullet, but if deployed quickly and strategically the drug could potentially help bend the pandemic’s “hockey stick” curve. Hydroxychloroquine is a common generic drug used to treat lupus, arthritis and malaria. The medication, whose brand name is Plaquenil, is relatively safe, with the main side effect being stomach irritation, though it can cause echocardiogram and vision changes. In 2005, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study showed that chloroquine, an analogue, could block a virus from penetrating a cell if administered before exposure. If tissue had already been infected, the drug inhibited the virus. On March 9 a team of researchers in China published results showing hydroxychloroquine was effective against the 2019 coronavirus in a test tube. The authors suggested a five-day, 12-pill treatment for Covid-19: two 200-milligram tablets twice a day on the first day followed by one tablet twice a day for four more days. TechCrunch reported on Thursday about a French study  “conducted from early March to March 16” that indicated chloroquine is promising in the treatment of coronavirus: A new study whose results were published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents has found early evidence that the combination of hydroxychloroquine, a popular anti-malaria drug known under the trade name Plaqenuil, and antibiotic azithromycin (aka Zithromax or Azithrocin) could be especially effective in treating the COVID-19 coronavirus and reducing the duration of the virus in patients. The researchers performed a study on 30 confirmed COVID-19 patients, treating each with either hydroxychloroquine on its own, a combination of the medicine with the antibiotic, as well as a control group that received neither. The study was conducted after reports from treatment of Chinese patients indicated that this particular combo had efficacy in shortening the duration of infection in patients. The patient mix included in the study included six who showed no symptoms whatsoever, as well as 22 who had symptoms in their upper respiratory tract (things like sneezing, headaches and sore throats, and eight who showed lower respiratory tract symptoms (mostly coughing). 20 of the 30 participants in the study received treatment, and the results showed that while hydroxycholoroquine was effective on its own as a treatment, when combined with azithromycin it was even more effective, and by a significant margin. An National Center for Biotechnology Information study published on March 10 which summarized the research on chloroquine available to that point concluded: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed Chloroquine has yet to be proven safe or effective as a treatment for coronavirus infection, noted Dr. Irwin Redlener, pediatrician and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, during Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Hayward asked about ongoing research into treatments for coronavirus infection. . . Redlener added, “One is new drugs that we need to develop and people are hard at work on that. The second is. do we have drugs around like Chloroquine that can be used safely to treat people, and right now, unfortunately, in spite of what the president said — the president said Chloroquine may be the answer, but about five seconds later Dr. Fauci got up and said not so fast, because we don’t know that it’s effective, and we don’t even know whether it’s safe. Any of evidence that we have is very anecdotal, and we can’t have doctors just prescribing it, because it may actually be very unsafe for these conditions. Actor Daniel Dae Quinn said over the weekend that treatment with hydrochloroquine helped in his recovery from coronavirus. The eyes of the entire country will now be focused on results of the trial to treat patients with coronavirus that will begin on Tuesday in New York.",Gov.

"The Federal Reserve said Monday it will purchase unlimited amounts of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities and buy corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and asset-backed securities for the first time. The Fed announced a major expansion of its programs to support the economy on Monday morning following several days of frantic moves by the central bank to expand its support for credit and money markets. Fiscal support for the economy, in the form of spending and lending programs from the federal government, stalled on Capitol Hill over the weekend. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s monetary policymaking unit, said it would purchase Treasury and mortgage securities “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.” The FOMC had previously said it would purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. The new announcement removes those caps and essentially means the Fed will purchase unlimited amounts of the bonds, a program some on Wall Street refer to “QE infinity.” The Fed also said it was launching two new bond buying programs that would purchase bonds directly from corporations and from the secondary market where bonds already issued are trading. This would be the first time the Fed became a direct purchaser of bonds issued by the corporate sector. The new programs are known as the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) for new bond and loan issuance and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) for outstanding corporate bonds. The Fed said its purchases of agency-backed mortgages would be expanded to include commercial mortgages, another move aimed at bolstering the corporate sector. A third new program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), will enable the issuance of asset-backed securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, and certain other assets. To help cities and states squeeze by the coronavirus, the Fed said it would expand its Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable rate demand notes and bank certificates of deposit. It is also expanding its Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to include high-quality, tax-exempt commercial paper as eligible securities and reducing pricing. In an even more radical move, the Fede said i9t expects to announce soon the establishment of a Main Street Business Lending Program to support lending to eligible small-and-medium-sized businesses. The details of that program have yet to be announced but it is likely to involve the Fed buying small business loans made by banks.  ","Fed Promises Unlimited QE, Corporate Bond Buying, Muni Buying, and Main Street Credit",2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/23/fed-promises-unlimited-qe-corporate-bond-buying-muni-buying-and-main-street-credit/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump did something difficult and remarkable during the White House press briefing on Sunday: he stood up for the free market in a moment of crisis, when at least half the country is pushing him to abandon it. A reporter asked the president why he was not using the Defense Production Act to nationalize industries to take control of companies and force them to produce needed health care equipment for treating coronavirus patients. Trump’s answer was that the United States does not believe in nationalization, and does not need it, either: Q: Mr. President, when it comes to the Defense Production Act. We know that governments across the country all day today were pleading with you to utilize. the DPA, to us it — Trump: Well, it depends which governments you’re talking about. Q: — specifically for that allocation piece that you mentioned, Mr. [Peter] Navarro. Why not use it now, if that would answer their pleas for help? Trump: Well, we are using it now. The fact that I signed it, it’s in effect. But you know, we’re a country not based on nationalizing our business. Call a person over in Venezuela. Ask them: how did nationalization of their businesses work out? Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept. The president continued by explaining that the private sector knew better than the government how to produce needed commodities — and which companies should produce them: Trump: Here’s the beauty of it. If we go out and we want, let’s say, masks, we don’t know who to call. But Hanes, who makes things of cotton, various elements, lots of things, it’s a great company. They called us, and they said, “We’re going to make millions of masks.” We got a call today from 3M… The president went on to explain that sometimes a company that government might think was best to produce a needed commodity might not actually be able to do it: Trump: If you go the national route, nationalization route. We’re gonna tell a company to make a ventilator? They don’t even know what a ventilator is! In the case of one company, they used to make them, years ago, and they know how to make them. You know, it’s a very complex piece of equipment, frankly. The president added that while nationalization was useful as a threat, it could also be damaging as a threat, because of negative signals it sent about the economy — and he reiterated that companies were stepping forward without the threat even being necessary: Trump: We have the threat of doing it if we need it. We may have to use of somewhere along the supply chain in a minor way. But we have millions of masks being done. We have respirators, we have ventilators… When this was announced, it sent tremors through our business community, and through our country, because basically what are you doing? You’re talking about — you’re going to nationalize an industry, or you’re going to nationalize? You’re going to take away companies? You’re going to tell companies what to do? The truth is most people — nobody would know where to start. There are companies out there that you wouldn’t think of that have called us … It is impossible to overstate the courage of this stance. During the 2008 financial crisis, the Bush administration rushed to bail out Wall Street — thereby destroying the incentives of the market, creating new moral hazards. Companies that had made risky bets were insulated from the actual consequences of those bets. Wall Street recovered; Main Street did not — at least, not until much later. Bush gave an address in November 2008, after Congress had passed the bailouts, and Barack Obama had won the election. “I’m a market-oriented guy, but not when I’m faced with the prospect of a global meltdown,” Bush said. He added: “[T]he long-term solution to today’s problems is sustained economic growth. And the surest path to that growth is free markets and free people.” But it was far too late for that. Bush threw free market principles overboard to bail out Wall Street. Trump, in contrast, is sticking to free market principles while coming to the aid of Main Street. No one would confuse Trump’s philosophy with a minimalist, purely libertarian approach. He is about to pump trillions of dollars of emergency stimulus into the economy — if all goes well. But he is not doing what the media, and the left, want him to do: to set the dangerous precedent of state control of the economy, when he can still do otherwise. He is standing up for freedom during a crisis, not after a crisis — because he knows the private sector works best. Joel B.

"The Hill reported Sunday that one of the reasons bipartisan support for a massive coronavirus stimulus package has fallen apart is, once again, because Democrats want the bill to prop up Planned Parenthood. According to the Hill: A Democratic aide said that the small business provision was drafted to exclude non-profits who receive Medicaid from being eligible for Small Business Administration assistance offered under the bill. That, according to the aide, would impact Planned Parenthood but also community health centers, rape crisis centers and disability service providers. Planned Parenthood is identified as a nonprofit, not a small business. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Sunday she will be moving ahead with her own emergency relief package and ended hopes for an immediate vote in the Senate to further assistance for the nation in the midst of the crisis caused by the virus that originated in China. Breitbart News reported: Senate Republicans and the White House have insisted that they will continue to push for the $1.6 trillion economic relief package, which would include $350 billion in support for small businesses and $250 billion for unemployment insurance. The package would also include direct cash payments to individuals around $1,200 per individual, with additional funds going to families with children. Politico also reported that Pelosi’s announcement is an indication she will not be simply taking up the Senate bill and moving it forward on a unanimous consent basis: That also means the House may be forced back into session, even though many lawmakers are concerned about the threat from the coronavirus and the difficulties in reaching Capitol Hill from their home districts. Fox News reported on the impasse: Democrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers — saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient. The Wall Street Journal‘s Kimberly Strassel also weighed in on the stalemate on Twitter: 1) The Senate bill is bipartisan; assembled with D input from Day One. Everyone understands need for liquidity, and biz $ that get out fast and stop more layoffs. Ds's also got plenty, from unemployment plus-ups to medical surge, to more gov $.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is attempting to use the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as a means to pursue progressive “decarceral policy” by calling for the release of older criminals from the Rikers Island complex, declaring the United States “must ensure” it is granting “elderly clemency.” The New York lawmaker made the remarks during an appearance in a virtual roundtable discussion on the coronavirus, hosted by her candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), on Sunday. She told viewers progressives need to “really hit fast forward on progressive developments and pursuing decarceral policy” during the coronavirus pandemic. That “decarceral policy” includes what Ocasio-Cortez has dubbed “elderly clemency,” or the release of older incarcerated individuals, particularly at Rikers. “I represent New York’s 14th Congressional District which covers the Bronx and Queens, and it includes Rikers Island. Now we have been pushing for criminal justice reforms for a very long time, and decarceral policy,” she said. “And one thing that we need to do right now is really hit fast forward on progressive developments and pursuing decarceral policy because people’s lives are at risk. There are people in jails right now, in situations that are completely destitute and wrong,” she continued, adding there are “so many people crammed into certain cells in Rikers.” Ocasio-Cortez cited the reports of 21 individuals at Rikers testing positive for the virus and used that as a catalyst to push for “elderly clemency” for people not just at Rikers but “in prisons throughout the United States.” She said: And 21 incarcerated individuals have already tested positive for COVID-19. Those are folks who have been able to get tested. And as we know, tests are very limited. They are rationed for people who are already exhibiting quite extreme symptoms so we have no idea how much this outbreak is going out. So there are a lot of things we are asking for. One, we need to provide elderly clemency. There are plenty of people on Rikers that have been 60, 70, 80, 90 years old, who quite literally need someone to take care of them and they’re still kept in a cage in Rikers Island and in prisons throughout the United States. We need to ensure that we are granting elderly clemency in the United States. The freshman lawmaker also said we need to “stop unnecessary pre-trial detention” and “stop arrests for low-level offenses.” Ocasio-Cortez, however, is far from the first to float a coronavirus “jailbreak.” Cities across the country — including Los Angeles County, California; Cook County, Illinois; and Cuyahoga County, Ohio — have released inmates in some form as a means to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as Breitbart News detailed.",Watch – ‘Elderly Clemency’: AOC Uses Coronavirus Crisis to Try to Release Older Criminals from Rikers,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/elderly-clemency-aoc-uses-coronavirus-crisis-to-try-to-release-older-criminals-from-rikers/,Breitbart
"Monday, MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski hit President Donald Trump over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic following a press conference over the weekend. Although Brzezinski has previously praised Trump’s tone amid the crisis, she said the president “does not have the mentality to lead” the country, adding the United States is “flying completely blind.” “I didn’t see much difference between yesterday’s update and any of the others,” Brzezinski stated. “In fact, I thought it was a lot worse. You know, there’s no national mobilization. There’s no triggering of the National Defense Mobilization Act. We still don’t have tests. We don’t know where we are. The entire country is flying blind, flying completely blind as to whether or not they’ve had it, have it, or are going to get it. That’s where we are right now still. And the president talking about his salary, making snarky comments about Mitt Romney, this is a man who does not have the mentality to lead us through this crisis.” She added, “Let’s dive right into the latest as to what we know with coronavirus spreading. State and local leaders pleading for help, laid-off workers in need of immediate relief. Washington providing little assurance to weary Americans over the weekend. The president rejected calls yesterday to use wartime powers to address shortages of face masks, ventilators and other critical equipment.

"With the UK’s coronavirus outbreak progress just two weeks behind Italy, the prime minister is said to be considering an enforced nationwide curfew as Britons ignore social distancing recommendations, whilst a government source has said that at least a lockdown of London is “inevitable”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said during Sunday’s coronavirus briefing that while he advises people to abide by the government’s advice on social distancing, “If people can’t do that, won’t do that, don’t do that, we will, of course, have to bring in tougher measures.” Clarifying that that could include “curfews and prohibitions on movement”, he said he and his team would be thinking about the option “very, very actively in the next 24 hours”. The warning came after the government enforced the closure of pubs, restaurants, and gyms in an effort to limit the chances of Britons coming into contact with one another and spreading the deadly Chinese coronavirus. MPs will debate the government’s emergency coronavirus bill this afternoon, with Prime Minister Johnson attempting to get the legislation through within the day. The law would give police the power to enforce lockdowns of venues and even the ability to detain those who refuse testing or isolation orders. Health secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News that a decision on whether to restrict Britons’ movements would come “very soon”, saying on Monday: “This isn’t the sort of thing that I wanted to do. But it’s the sort of thing that as a nation we’ve got to be prepared to see in order to stop this virus.” The health secretary also criticised those who are ignoring social distancing rules as ” very selfish”, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The consequence of that costs lives and it means for everyone this will go on for longer.” Boris Johnson Warns NHS Could Be ‘Overwhelmed’ by Coronavirus, UK Just Two Weeks Behind Italy https://t.co/n4itfVkmvc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2020  Official guidance was already updated to urge Britons to stay in their primary residence amidst reports over the weekend that beauty spots were seeing higher-than-expected numbers of visitors, sparking fears that rural and coastal communities could be infected by city-dwelling day-trippers. The National Trust, which manages some of Britain’s historic buildings and parklands, announced on Saturday that it would be closing its parks and gardens after shuttering its houses last week. Authorities which run sites in the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales have also told people to stay away, saying “now is not the time for tourism”. Parks across London are also closing as it became evident during the warming Spring weather this weekend that Londoners were not heeding social distancing advice. The prime minister is also reportedly facing pressure from the Cabinet and advisers to lock down London, which is weeks ahead of the rest of the country in terms of infection. A government source told The Times: “The prime minister will have the full support of the cabinet and the country at large if he goes ahead with this.” The source added: “It is inevitable, you just have to look at other countries. The sooner you do it the better. The difficulty the government is facing is that the spread of this virus is exponential. We won’t know if what we’re doing is the right thing until it is too late.” London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, warned that more “people will die” unless his city’s residents heed social distancing recommendations. “Unless people stay at home, unless people stop using public transport unless it’s essential, unless people stop interacting with each other, more people will die,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The government had denied last week that a London lockdown was on the cards, with a spokesman saying there was “zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of London”.

"Pennsylvania officials reopened over a dozen rest areas on a Thursday, heeding to calls from truckers who are working tirelessly to keep the country’s supply chains open amid the ongoing spread of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation reopened 13 of its 30 rest stops on a limited basis on the interstates and throughout the Pennsylvania Turnpike. “They are located on Interstate 81, north and southbound stops in Luzerne and Cumberland counties; on Interstate 79, north and southbound stops in Crawford County and the northbound stop in Allegheny County; and on Interstate 80, east and westbound stops in Venango, Centre and Montour counties,” notes the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said in a statement that the sites will have five portable toilets, though the services plazas will remain closed due to a lack of cleaning staff. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission reopened all 17 of its service plazas at 7 a.m. Friday, though on a limited basis. Turnpike spokeswoman Rosanne Placey said it had closed down the plazas to give 7-Eleven and HMS Host an opportunity to prepare plans on how to keep the facilities clean while maintaining standard service. “We realize how vital [truckers’] service is so we’re happy we can reopen even on a limited basis,” said Placey. “Even with this change, the food service will be open on a limited basis. We can’t have a lot of people there and they can’t eat inside.” The development comes after one of the country’s largest trucking trade organizations criticized the closings, saying the stops are critical to drivers for, especially during the pandemic. “We understand this decision was likely made in an effort to limit passenger vehicle movement, interaction among travelers, and the state’s administration and supervision of these facilities during an emergency declaration,” the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said in a statement on Tuesday. “However, rest areas are vitally important to truckers, who at this time are being heavily relied upon to transport critical supplies across the country.” “Pennsylvania is a major contributor to the nation’s economy and its location between the Northeast region and markets in the South and Midwest means countless truckers move across the state each day,” the statement added. “Many of these truckers rely on the state’s rest areas to do just that – rest!” As of Sunday, Pennsylvania’s total coronavirus case count stands at 479 and three deaths. “Our notable increase in cases over the last few days indicate we need everyone to take COVID-19 seriously,” Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said. “Pennsylvanians have a very important job right now stay calm, stay home and stay safe. We have seen case counts continue to increase and the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home.” “If we have a moderate surge [in cases], then we are prepared,” Gov. Tom Wolf (D) added in reference to the state’s hospital resources. “If it is greater, then we aren’t prepared.” On Thursday, Wolf issued a shutdown order to tens of thousands of “non-life-sustaining” businesses in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly illness.",Pennsylvania Reopens Turnpike Rest Areas for Truckers,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/pennsylvania-reopens-rest-areas-on-turnpike-for-truckers/,Breitbart
"TEL AVIV – Israel’s first coronovirus fatality, 88-year-old Holocaust survivor Aryeh Even, was buried Sunday in Jerusalem with 20 mourners at his funeral. Even’s family said they were sorry that they could not be by his side at the end. “He was a dear and beloved man, living a full life, devoted to his family, a strong man until the end. We are sorry to have passed his last days and moments at a time when his family members were prevented from being by his side,” a statement from the family said. Even was hospitalized in Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center after contracting the virus from the assisted living facility where he resided. Several other residents of the Nofim Tower home were also diagnosed with COVID-19. Even had multiple pre-existing medical conditions. Even’s body was treated in such a way as to not endanger anyone who came into contact with it. For that reason, the Jewish purification process known as taharah was not performed. Other, less critical, patients of Shaare Tzedek’s newly established COVID-19 ward recited the shema with Even as he took his last breaths. According to Rachel Gemara, a nurse on the ward, due to the contagion hands-on care by medical staff is extremely limited, so many of the younger, healthier COVID-19 patients have taken it upon themselves to care for those in more critical condition. Those patients, she said, felt Even’s loss on a “deep level.” “It was difficult for them because they really are very much a family,” Gemara said. “When someone passes away it’s a huge deal for them.” Gemara posted a moving tribute addressed to Even on her Facebook page. “You’ve touched my heart, the staff, and the patients that surrounded you. I know your life will inspire the rest of Am Yisrael [the nation of Israel] as well. Go in peace, go to your resting place in peace. Look out for us from above,” she wrote on Sunday. My dear Aryeh, you survived the horrors of the Holocaust, immigrated to Israel, established a magnificent family and your extraordinary journey ends here, in this new ward we hoped we would never have to open. The circumstances of your hospitalisation did not allow for your loving family and caretaker to be by your side. For us and them, this was heartbreaking. We did our best to go in as often as possible. From the outside, we monitored you as closely as we could. In the unit, we were in awe as we watched the other patients care for you, keep you company and helped you however best they could. They so badly did not want you to ever feel alone. Aryeh, I want to ask you for forgiveness. I’m sorry for how we were required to handle your body, we did our best to preserve your dignity and respect you based on the circumstances. I know that it was done to protect us. It was a tremendous zechut and honor to care for you in your final days. You’ve touched my heart, the staff, and the patients that surrounded you. I know your life will inspire the rest of Am Yisrael as well. Go in peace, go to your resting place in peace. Look out for us from above. Twenty mourners gathered at Givat Shaul cemetery, standing two meters apart from one another as per the new regulations. By Sunday, 1,071 Israelis were confirmed to have contracted the virus, 20 of whom the health ministry said were in critical condition. Even arrived in Israel alone from Hungary in 1949.

"President Donald Trump may be right to claim that he “inherited” a system that was not ready to fight a pandemic, according to a report that the Obama administration depleted the nation’s stock of N95 masks and never restored it. The Washington Examiner, citing Bloomberg News and the Los Angeles Times, reported Monday that the Obama administration used millions of N95 masks in the fight against the H1N1 virus in 2009, but did not replace them: The national shortage of N95 respirator masks can be traced back to 2009 after the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, when the Obama administration was advised to replenish a national stockpile but did not, according to reports from Bloomberg News and the Los Angeles Times. … A federally backed task force and a safety equipment organization both recommended to the Obama administration that the stockpile be replenished of the 100 million masks used after the H1N1 outbreak, according to the Los Angeles Times. Charles Johnson, president of the International Safety Equipment Association, said that advice was never heeded. … Bloomberg News reported similar findings last week, noting, “after the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009, which triggered a nationwide shortage of masks and caused a 2- to 3-year backlog orders for the N95 variety, the stockpile distributed about three-quarters of its inventory and didn’t build back the supply.” The Trump administration has enlisted the support of private industry to produce hundreds of millions of masks, which are primarily needed for hospitals, and health care workers on the front lines of the fight against coronavirus.

"I grew up in Miami, but never participated in the spring break ritual, because I was studying in a yeshiva (religious seminary). So, no doubt, there is a tinge of jealousy in seeing thousands of young men and women partying on the beaches of Texas and Florida while I’m cooped up in the freezing cold of New Jersey and New York. My overwhelming feeling, however, is confusion at seeing this spectacle juxtaposed with the stories of the coronavirus stacking up bodies in churches in Italy. These young people, who probably never watch the nightly news, are still aware of the global crisis from their smartphones. They know that people are dying, that tens of thousands are infected, and that our country is on the verge of paralysis as we are asked to stay in our homes to prevent the spread of the disease. Yet we see them frolicking in the sea, potential carriers of the disease who are putting other people at risk and endangering themselves. I get it. Some people feel we’re overreacting. Among them are my friend Bret Stephens and Tom Friedman, both of the New York Times, who would not condone the beach scenes but who feel the shutdown of American business is a cure worse than the disease. But still. Even if those who say we’re overreacting are right, shouldn’t those who are part of the partying scene feel that it’s unseemly at a time when so many are suffering? We know that America’s college students probably worked hard at school and looked forward all year to a week of partying. Still, it is not too much to expect a modicum of respect, an acknowledgement that we are all in this fight for survival together. If you’re going to get sloshed at a bar, the rest of us probably don’t need to see you broadcast it on social media. But a lot of people just don’t seem to give a damn. I saw one spring breaker interviewed on TV. When he was asked whether he was worried about the virus, he said something along the lines of: “Whether I get the virus or not, I’m going to keep partying.” Ok, I’m not entirely surprised. Young people are often narcissistic and believe they are invincible. They’ve also been lulled into complacency by reports that the most vulnerable people are elderly, and that if young people do get the disease, it’s not much worse than the flu. Well, now we’re getting more information, and it turns out that is not entirely correct. New Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data indicate nearly 40 percent of patients sick enough to be hospitalized were age 20 to 54. A lot of you folks on the beach fall into that range. We’re fortunate that the youth of today have not — until now — been forced to learn the meaning of sacrifice. When I was in yeshiva in New York, a rabbi told us that during the Holocaust, they’d tell kids in yeshiva to do something to show they cared, to sacrifice something, even if it was as trivial as giving up eating candy to demonstrate empathy for the suffering of Jews elsewhere. Obviously, that was not going to save anyone in Europe. But the point was to teach children that when world is on fire and people are suffering, you should minimize your pleasure. This isn’t the Holocaust or World War II. God willing, we will take the necessary measures, and our medical researchers will discover a vaccine to flatten the curve and minimize the sickness, death, and economic pain caused by the virus. But right now, virtually the entire world is suffering. People are really scared. Imagine how it must look to people in, say, Italy, where the pandemic is taking thousands of lives, to see pictures of young Americans partying on the beach. They must be appalled by the insensitivity and indifference. I understand that confining hundreds of thousand of teenagers to their rooms is impractical. Believe me, my family and I are going a bit stir crazy. But we also have a future to consider. Of course, not every teenager is partying at the beach. This is a generation that has demonstrated the potential to teach their elders lessons about what it takes to save the world. They are fighting for social justice and the need to address things like unnecessarily harming the environment. Now is the time to harness that positive energy for the benefit of America. Young people are less susceptible to the disease, and if they’re careful and follow the health guidelines, they help people who are suffering and vulnerable. I saw a clip on the news of two people who played their instruments on the porch of an elderly woman living alone. There are other ways to help people confined to their homes feel less isolated. The healthy can pick up and deliver medications and groceries for the elderly, or help provide meals to poor children. This is the time for young people to prove they can be the next “greatest generation.” We’re dealing with an emergency now, but we should already start planning for the future so our youth can develop greater sensitivity, a sense of pride, and a realization that they have an obligation to their country. Israelis learn these attributes serving in the military, men for nearly three years and women for two. We do not face the existential threat Israelis do, so I don’t think we should be instituting a mandatory year of national service. But we should encourage it. In my religious movement, Chabad, we are expected to give two of our teenage years to the global Jewish community. (I did mine in Sydney, Australia, where I, together with nine colleagues, pioneered the Rabbinical College of Australia’s largest city, where we conducted hundreds of communal events.) We don’t need four years of university in America. I was the Rabbi at Oxford and it’s a three-year undergraduate program. The same is true for other world-class European institutions, such as the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics. We can begin making the fourth year of one of national commitment on the part of young Americans, to teach them selflessness and service. Our teens don’t have to make many sacrifices for this country. Is it too much to ask every high school graduate to commit a year to helping their fellow Americans? One of the great things about young people today is that many are enthusiastic about public service. We see this when students volunteer to help communities after national disasters. It should not be that onerous to ask every student to participate in a project that will truly make America greater. It has become popular for young people to take gap years before going to college — so why not put time to use for the betterment of society? If college is only three years, they will be finished with school at the same time as if they had gone straight to a four-year school. An added benefit is that students and their parents would save a fortune in tuition and loans. President Trump can encourage a new moral regeneration by leading the call for a year of national service and offering incentives for participation. The current crisis will not be our last. We will be far better prepared for the next one if we have an army of people dedicated to serving the needs of their fellow Americans. President Trump can bring new moral regeneration to our nation by using this time to call for a year of voluntary national service. President Kennedy did it very effectively with the peace corps. It’s time for a new age of youth service.

"U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams issued Americans a stark warning on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during an appearance Monday on NBC’s “Today.” Adams, in what he called a “somber occasion,” warned that it is “going to get bad” this week. He also called on people to “stay at home” to help combat the spread. “I want America to understand, this week it’s going to get bad, and we really need to come together as a nation,” Adams told host Savannah Guthrie. “I heard the stories that you were just playing: young people out on beaches. We see here in D.C. that the district set up a cam for people to watch the cherry blossoms. You look on the cam. You see more people walking around than you see cherry blossoms.” “And this is how the spread is occurring. And so we really, really need everyone to stay at home,” he added. Guthrie asked Adams if he thinks people are not taking the virus seriously enough. “I think that there are a lot of people who are doing the right things, but I think that, unfortunately, we’re finding out a lot of people think this can’t happen to them,” Adams emphasized.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Sunday suggested that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is hitting the United States “so hard” because the U.S. has “one of the worst healthcare systems in the developed world.” She attributed the increased hardships to “inequities of race and immigration status.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) featured Ocasio-Cortez, as well as her fellow “Squad” members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), in a virtual roundtable discussion on the coronavirus pandemic Sunday evening. The New York lawmaker listed several reasons she believes the pandemic is hitting the U.S. “so hard” and suggested that “inequities of race and immigration status” are worsening the crisis: The reason we are here and the reason this crisis is hitting us so hard is because we have one of the worst healthcare systems in the developed world. We pay less than a living wage to a shamefully large amount of workers in the United States. Paid sick leave is not guaranteed. “And we have to make sure that people have basic rights and — as well as labor rights,” she continued. “So all of these things are contributing factors as to why this is hitting us so hard.” “But then you take that economic piece and you layer on inequities of race and immigration status, and you see how things can get even worse,” the freshman lawmaker added.

"(AP) – A jury on Monday cleared former Scottish leader Alex Salmond of all sex-crimes charges he was facing in an Edinburgh court. Jurors had retired to consider their verdicts on Friday. Salmond, 65, denied all 13 alleged sexual offenses, including one of attempted rape, against nine women. The women either worked for the Scottish government or within Salmond´s Scottish National Party at the time the offenses are alleged to have taken place. The accusations ranged from Salmond stroking a civil servant´s hair to trying to rape a former Scottish government official in the leader´s official residence in Edinburgh. Salmond led the pro-independence Scottish National Party for 20 years and headed Scotland´s semi-autonomous government as its first minister from 2007 to 2014. A major figure on the Scottish political stage for decades, he took Scotland to the verge of independence from the U.K. by holding a 2014 referendum on separation. He stepped down as leader after the “remain” side won the vote 55% to 45%.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Monday that Chinese coronavirus cases in the state have soared 38 percent overnight to 20,875, thanks in part to more widespread testing. “This could go on for several months,” Cuomo said of the jump in cases during his daily press briefing. The governor noted approximately 13 percent of cases have been hospitalized thus far and 157 people have died. “Nobody can tell you is it four months, six months, eight months, nine months. But it is several months,” he stated. “We all have to now confront that that is a new reality. That is not going to change. You are not going to turn on the news tomorrow morning and they’re going to say surprise surprise this is all now resolved in two weeks.” New York has the most confirmed infections in the country, with New York City accounting for 12,305 of them. Cuomo estimated that up to 80 percent of the state’s 19.4 million residents will contract the illness but has said that “few will truly be in danger.” Cuomo also issued an emergency order Monday directing hospitals to increase their capacity by 50%. “I think it’s unreasonable to tell hospitals to double their capacity,” he said. “They must increase by 50% at least.” Meanwhile, the state is running clinical trials beginning Tuesday of the ant-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in response to testimonies that it is a possible treatment against the virus.","New York Confirms 20,875 Coronavirus Cases as Testing Ramps Up",2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/new-york-confirms-20875-coronavirus-cases-as-testing-ramps-up/,Breitbart
"The gun sales surge accompanying the Chinese conronavirus pandemic is overwhelming both state and federal background check systems. On March 19, 2020, Breitbart News reported National Shooting Sports Foundation numbers showing gun sales in the U.S. had jumped 300 percent above where they were at the same point in time last year. Thereafter, various Federal Firearm License holders (FFLs) contacted Breitbart News to talk of calling into the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Checks (NICS) to do a background check for a pending sale, only to be placed on hold for hours and/or, in some cases, to have the line disconnected. An FFL from a western state told Breitbart News he has a stack of background checks forms–ATF form 4473–already filled out by customers who came into the store to purchase firearms during the sales surge. The FFL arrives at store early in the morning and places a call to the FBI NICS number simply to be placed in the queue, and once he is talking to someone he runs as many of the background checks as he can before being disconnected. An FFL in a midwestern state told Breitbart News he lost “$10,000 to “$12,000” in sales on Friday, March 20, 2020, due to delays in NICS response to phone calls for background checks. An FFL in a southern state told a similar story after having so many struggles with NICS that he thought the background check system had simply been shut down. The Scranton Times-Tribune reports a similar story on the state-level background check system in Pennsylvania. They noted that on March 18, 2020, “The state police announced the computer system that conducts background checks on firearms purchases, which is called the Pennsylvania Instant Check System, crashed twice in one day.” This failure came as gun transactions on March 19, 2020, jumped over 300 percent higher than they were on March 19, 2019. Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Records and Identification’s Maj. Gary Dance stressed the crashing of the state’s background check system was not due to an intentional state response to the coronavirus. Rather, the system was just overwhelmed.

"Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) are calling on Twitter to ban Chinese Communist Party officials from the platform over misinformation about the Wuhan Coronavirus. “By banning Twitter in China, the Chinese Communist Party is keeping its citizens in the dark. By putting propaganda on Twitter, the Chinese Communist Party is lying to the rest of the world,” wrote the GOP legislators, in a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. “It is clear that Chinese Communist Party officials are using twitter to disseminate propaganda in the midst of a dangerous global crisis,” argued Sen. Sasse and Rep. Gallagher. “Even worse, this propaganda obscures and confuses users over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially undermines efforts to contain and control the outbreak. We believe this behavior more than warrants their removal from the platform.” Last week, Twitter ramped up its policies around coronavirus misinformation, even declaring that it would ban certain jokes about the virus. Twitter said it would ban “description of treatments or protective measures which are not immediately harmful but are known to be ineffective, are not applicable to the COVID-19 context, or are being shared with the intent to mislead others, even if made in jest.” Twitter also said it would ban a range of other posts that constitute “false or misleading” information or “denial of scientific facts” about certain aspects of the Chinese coronavirus.

"Planned Parenthood’s abortion facilities should be used to treat coronavirus patients, advised Lila Rose, founder and president of Live Action, in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak. Pollak noted proposals in California to use both public and private operations as treatment centers for those infected with the coronavirus, including hotels and local recreation centers. He asked if Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) should consider issuing such a guidance for Planned Parenthood’s clinics. “It’s a great idea,” responded Rose. “If you can turn a hotel into a place to care for coronavirus patients or expected [and] potential patients, why wouldn’t you be able to do that to a Planned Parenthood or abortion facility?” Rose continued, “It’s a fantastic idea. This is a true test of our moral compass, and really our honesty with ourselves and with each other. That’s what this whole crisis allows. It’s obviously a dark day in many ways, but it also can be an opportunity for a moral reckoning. LISTEN:  “Turn the abortions facilities into places that can save human life instead of taking them,” added Rose. “It seems completely obvious to me. I think it would be obvious to a lot of people. Let’s see what our politicians do and let’s make our voices heard in the meantime to call for them to do the right thing.” Rose described Planned Parenthood’s continuance of performing abortions during the coronavirus outbreak as ironic given implemented measures to save lives from the virus. “As most Americans are experiencing right now, many of us have stay-at-home orders from our state government,” observed Rose. “The whole country has been told to practice social distancing, to work from home if possible and this is because, of course, the desire to save human life from the coronavirus and COVID-19.” Rose went on, “At the same time, we have abortion facilities remaining open. I’m in the city of Los Angeles, here in California, and … the mayor has said that all businesses should effectively shut down except for essential businesses, and then just a couple days ago, the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, said that all companies that are not essential services must close down, workers must work from home if they can, and he said all elective medical procedures must also be put on hold. Despite all of that, as a last Friday, abortion clinics [and] Planned Parenthood facilities are still open for business in Los Angeles and throughout the state.” Rose continued, “It is a really horrible time when on one hand we are fighting to save human life, but abortion facilities are mercilessly ignoring even the mandates coming from authorities and remaining open and killing innocent human life, ending innocent human lives.” Newsom’s recent directives include the indefinite postponement of elective medical procedures, including prenatal care appointments, noted Rose, adding, “Even Planned Parenthood themselves — and the abortion industry itself — defines the vast majority of abortions as elective medical procedures.” “The vast majority of abortions are done as elective procedures, meaning, for the sake of convenience or other reasons, so technically they should be shutting down, right now,” Rose explained. “Unfortunately, there is this incredible double standard — or this hypocrisy — that is happening right now in California and beyond in many other states, because on the one hand we’re ready to protect human life from the virus. We’re literally shutting down businesses, people’s livelihoods are on the line, many people have lost their jobs, all in order to save innocent life, which I think many people want to get behind, and we care about human life, but then on the on the other hand, we are tolerating abortion facilities being open and on average killing 2,363 children every single day.” Rose remarked, “It’s heartbreaking. It’s not odd considering the way our society treats life in the womb, and we see children as totally disposable. Literally, they can be destroyed as long as they’re in utero. They can just be destroyed and thrown out like medical waste.” Planned Parenthood and other abortion operations target vulnerable women who fear pregnancy, Rose said. “If we allow abortion facilities to remain open right now, they will prey on the fears of women — especially younger women — who may feel that they’re getting pregnant, right now, or they may be already pregnant going into this crisis [and fear] that they cannot handle the future, Rose stated. “Maybe the idea of being a mother or even going through the pregnancy is overwhelming for them.” Rose went on, “So now, these abortion facilities are mercilessly preying on their fears and literally profiting off of a time when people are literally going bankrupt, losing their jobs, [and] many of them losing their savings or they don’t have savings.” “Now is the time for political action to shut these facilities down,” concluded Rose. “I’d like to see that from the White House recommending that because again, some states are still tolerating open abortion facility as of late last week.  Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

"Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) skipped a procedural vote in the Senate Sunday evening, opting instead to participate in a livestream with progressive “Squad” members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Senate Democrats blocked a $1.4 trillion relief bill designed to boost the stalling U.S. economy over the next 12 weeks. The bipartisan package, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) introduced, failed to obtain approval on a 47-47 procedural vote. Sixty votes were needed to pass. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Sunday she will move forward with her own emergency relief plan. “It is hard for me to believe that in the midst of this terrible crisis that we have a Senate Republican bill that would give the Trump administration a blank check to hand out corporate welfare to virtually any corporation in America, without conditions as to how they can protect workers in this country,” Sanders claimed of the bipartisan rescue package. Sanders then asserted that the plan would provide too much relief for corporations and not enough for American families. “I know some of my Republican colleagues are talking about, gee, a one time, $1,000 payment, really, really gonna last for two or three weeks, and what happens after that?” asked the Vermont senator. “We must act in an unprecedented way. Don’t matter what it costs.” Ocasio-Cortez echoed Sanders’ criticism, calling the package a “complete mockery of public service.” “We’re supposed to be here to help people. What Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate just presented was just a package of corporate sweeteners to hand a blank check to Trump and Mnuchin,” said the New York Democrat. Ocasio-Cortez then suggested that the Chinese coronavirus has taken a toll on the country because it has “one of the worst healthcare systems in the developed world,” which she attributed to “inequities of race and immigration status.” “The reason we are here and the reason this crisis is hitting us so hard is because we have one of the worst healthcare systems in the developed world. We pay less than a living wage to a shamefully large amount of workers in the United States. Paid sick leave is not guaranteed,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And we have to make sure that people have basic rights and — as well as labor rights,” the freshman congresswoman went on. “So all of these things are contributing factors as to why this is hitting us so hard.” “But then you take that economic piece and you layer on inequities of race and immigration status, and you see how things can get even worse,” she added. After the vote failed, McConnell criticized the Democrats on the Senate floor, stating there had been approximately 48 hours of bipartisan negotiations, accusing them of “fiddling” with the emotions, healthcare, and the markets of the American people. “The American people expect us to act tomorrow, and I want everyone to fully understand, if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it’ll be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dither when the country expects us to come together and address this problem.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) responded that the negotiations were not bipartisan and that the bill “has many problems,” specifically a large corporate bailout that contains no protections for workers and little oversight. “Also very troubling in the bill were significant shortfalls of money that our hospitals, states, cities, and medical workers desperately needed,” he said. “This is a public health crisis. It is inexplicable to skimp on funding to address the pandemic.” The UPI contributed to this report. ",Bernie Sanders Bails on Coronavirus Package Vote for Livestream with ‘Squad’,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/bernie-sanders-bails-coronavirus-package-vote-livestream-squad/,Breitbart
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday that New York State has acquired 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine to implement drug trials to treat patients with coronavirus, which will begin on Tuesday. “We’re also implementing the trial drug,” Cuomo said: We have secured 70,000 hydrocloroquin; 10,000 zithromax from the federal government. I want to thank the FDA for moving very expeditiously to get us this supply. The President ordered the FDA to move and the FDA moved. We’re going to get the supply and the trial will start this Tuesday. The President is optimistic about these drugs and we are all optimistic that it could work. I’ve spoken with a number of health officials and there is a good basis to believe that they could work. Some health officials point to Africa, which has a very low infection rate and there’s a theory that because they’re taking these anti-malaria drugs in Africa, it may actually be one of the reasons why the infection rate is low in Africa. We don’t know, but let’s find out and let’s find out quickly. And I agree with the President on that and we’re going to start and we’re going to start Tuesday. New York City and Westchester County, New York are now the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. As of 10:00 p.m. eastern on Sunday, New York State has reported 15,168 cases. The majority of those cases–more than 10,900–are in New York City and Westchester County. Nationwide, 33,546 cases of coronavirus have been reported as of 10:00 p.m. eastern on Sunday, according to the Worldometers website. The death toll in the United States as of 10:00 p.m. eastern on Sunday is now 419, with 114 of those in New York State, 95 in Washington State, and 34 in California. At a press conference on Thursday President Trump said chloroquine looked promising as a treament for coronavirus, and instructed the Food and Drug Administration to move quickly to move it into clinical testing: Later that day, the FDA issued a statement about chloroquine: President Trump has directed the FDA to continue its work with the public and private sector to ensure the availability of potentially safe and effective life-saving drugs to patients who are in desperate need, including those infected with COVID-19. with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19. On Friday, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told NPR that doctors have the ability to write prescriptions for chloroquine today, because it has been approved for the treatment of malaria, even though clinical trials have not been completed that could lead to its approval for treatment of coronavirus: And this is an individual doctor decision. We’ll be providing — not we FDA — but the CDC will be providing some guidance about that with respect to potential therapeutic options. But you’re right. I mean, absolutely. And this [chloroquine] is a drug that’s available to physicians to prescribe now. . . What I’m saying is an individual doctor has to incorporate the data to make the decision for their individual patients. And one of the ways we’re going to try to make this available on a more widespread basis is through this expanded access approach. . . So we’re working on [when that starts] now where obviously supply and availability of a drug is an issue. But there is an all-of-government approach on this. Critics of the president claimed his optimism about chloroquine was unwarranted, but two doctors writing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday said the drug “is showing promise” as a treatment for coronavirus: A flash of potential good news from the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic: A treatment is showing promise. Doctors in France, South Korea and the U.S. are using an antimalarial drug known as hydroxychloroquine with success. We are physicians treating patients with Covid-19, and the therapy appears to be making a difference. It isn’t a silver bullet, but if deployed quickly and strategically the drug could potentially help bend the pandemic’s “hockey stick” curve. Hydroxychloroquine is a common generic drug used to treat lupus, arthritis and malaria. The medication, whose brand name is Plaquenil, is relatively safe, with the main side effect being stomach irritation, though it can cause echocardiogram and vision changes. In 2005, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study showed that chloroquine, an analogue, could block a virus from penetrating a cell if administered before exposure. If tissue had already been infected, the drug inhibited the virus. On March 9 a team of researchers in China published results showing hydroxychloroquine was effective against the 2019 coronavirus in a test tube. The authors suggested a five-day, 12-pill treatment for Covid-19: two 200-milligram tablets twice a day on the first day followed by one tablet twice a day for four more days. TechCrunch reported on Thursday about a French study  “conducted from early March to March 16” that indicated chloroquine is promising in the treatment of coronavirus: A new study whose results were published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents has found early evidence that the combination of hydroxychloroquine, a popular anti-malaria drug known under the trade name Plaqenuil, and antibiotic azithromycin (aka Zithromax or Azithrocin) could be especially effective in treating the COVID-19 coronavirus and reducing the duration of the virus in patients. The researchers performed a study on 30 confirmed COVID-19 patients, treating each with either hydroxychloroquine on its own, a combination of the medicine with the antibiotic, as well as a control group that received neither. The study was conducted after reports from treatment of Chinese patients indicated that this particular combo had efficacy in shortening the duration of infection in patients. The patient mix included in the study included six who showed no symptoms whatsoever, as well as 22 who had symptoms in their upper respiratory tract (things like sneezing, headaches and sore throats, and eight who showed lower respiratory tract symptoms (mostly coughing). 20 of the 30 participants in the study received treatment, and the results showed that while hydroxycholoroquine was effective on its own as a treatment, when combined with azithromycin it was even more effective, and by a significant margin. An National Center for Biotechnology Information study published on March 10 which summarized the research on chloroquine available to that point concluded: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed Chloroquine has yet to be proven safe or effective as a treatment for coronavirus infection, noted Dr. Irwin Redlener, pediatrician and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, during Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Hayward asked about ongoing research into treatments for coronavirus infection. . . Redlener added, “One is new drugs that we need to develop and people are hard at work on that. The second is. do we have drugs around like Chloroquine that can be used safely to treat people, and right now, unfortunately, in spite of what the president said — the president said Chloroquine may be the answer, but about five seconds later Dr. Fauci got up and said not so fast, because we don’t know that it’s effective, and we don’t even know whether it’s safe. Any of evidence that we have is very anecdotal, and we can’t have doctors just prescribing it, because it may actually be very unsafe for these conditions. Actor Daniel Dae Kim said over the weekend that treatment with hydrochloroquine helped in his recovery from coronavirus. The eyes of the entire country will now be focused on results of the trial to treat patients with coronavirus that will begin on Tuesday in New York.",Gov.

"Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio is refusing to comply with an order by the state’s attorney general that bans nonessential and elective surgical procedures, such as abortions, during the coronavirus pandemic. A lawyer for the abortion facility responded to a letter from the office of state Attorney General Dave Yost, asserting the order allows Planned Parenthood to “still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion.”  CBS News reported a spokesperson for Yost’s office, however, said Ohio abortion providers must stop performing the procedure. The report continued that at least five of Ohio’s six abortion providers have refused to comply with the order. Iris E. Harvey and Kersha Deibel, the respective heads of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region, said: Planned Parenthood’s top priority is ensuring that every person can continue accessing essential health care, including abortion. We know your health care can’t wait. Abortion is an essential, time-sensitive medical procedure. The state wants to ensure all supplies of personal protective equipment are used for those medical personnel who are dealing with the spread of the infection caused by the coronavirus that originated in China. In Ohio, Planned Parenthood runs Planned Parenthood Bedford Health Center, Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio in Cincinnati and Planned Parenthood East Health in Columbus. Preterm of Cleveland, another abortion provider, also refused to comply with the order to halt abortions during the coronavirus pandemic. The facility said it would be having fewer appointments and enacting “stringent precautionary measures to keep our patients, staff, and their families safe and healthy,” CBS News reported.  Women’s Med Center of Dayton also refused to comply with the order to stop abortions, reported the Dayton Daily News. “This is not about abortions,” Bethany McCorkle, a spokesperson for Yost, reportedly told CBS News on Sunday. “This is about nonessential surgeries using PPE [personal protective equipment] during this pandemic.” ""As we navigate COVID-19, it is critical that leaders treat outpatient abortion providers as essential businesses, and that hospital systems ensure the continuation of abortion care as an essential service.""https://t.co/zsj2HQ97le — NAF (@NatAbortionFed) March 17, 2020  The Daily News also reported Harvey and Deibel said Planned Parenthood “is taking steps to reduce the use of personal protective equipment and is complying with the state order because abortion is an essential, time-sensitive medical procedure,’” a statement that could bring into question whether the abortions the chain is performing are being conducted with less safety due to the reduction in “use of personal protective equipment.” Mark Harrington, president of pro-life group Created Equal, said: If abortion is health care, as the abortion industry claims, this is an opportunity for them to act like it and comply with the governor’s order. However, we have evidence they are defying the order and staying open. Remaining open risks public health and safety during this national crisis. Abortion centers are not above the law.

Abortion is not health care. Abortion is not essential.” On Friday, Yost’s office sent letters to Women’s Med Center in Dayton and Planned Parenthood of Cincinnati Surgery Center ordering them to “immediately stop performing non-essential and elective surgical abortions.” “If you or your facility do not immediately stop performing non-essential or elective surgical abortions in compliance with the (health director’s) order, the Department of Health will take all appropriate measures,” the letters read.

"The New York Times repeatedly edited the headline of its coverage of Senate Democrats blocking the economic relief package crafted to address the hardships created by the novel coronavirus — a move President Trump noticed, prompting him to blast the paper for making changes “in order to satisfy the Radical Left.” “The New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left.

McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.” “She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” he added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.” Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are reportedly pushing to broaden the relief package to include “unprecedented collective bargaining powers for unions” as well as “increased fuel emissions standards for airlines” and the “expansion of wind and solar tax credits,” according to Fox News contributor and Town Hall political editor Guy Benson: Source writes, “not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether—directly causing unnecessary layoffs.” — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) March 23, 2020  Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) demonstrated the mentality of his caucus last week, reportedly pitching the response package as a “tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.” “So when the original package — which was agreed upon — was brought up just to allow 30 more hours to debate, Democrats voted against,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) said during an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday. “Now we’ve got an American economy which is just tanking because we don’t have certainty as to the government’s response, and Pelosi and Schumer have decided that they are going to obstruct after they helped negotiate the deal,” he continued. “I cannot believe that Pelosi and Schumer are attempting to do this,” he added. “Frankly, I am shocked that Democratic senators are going along with it.

"CNN’s Jake Tapper is admitting he knew Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told a lie about President Trump on his Sunday show and he chose to not challenge or correct her. This is a remarkable admission from an increasingly unstable CNN anchor, who just last week demanded the American president stop communicating directly with the American people. Before I get to the specifics of what happened, I want to be very clear about what happened… This is not a situation where a politician snuck one past an interviewer. No, Tapper knew she was lying and chose not to correct the record or challenger her. And how do we know Tapper knew she was lying and chose not to correct the record or challenge her? Because Tapper is proudly and publicly admitting he knew she was lying and chose not to correct the record or challenger her. To make matters worse, and as if to prove he could use a few weeks bed rest to box his moral compass (if he even has one), Tapper is blaming Trump for his own breathtaking lack of journalistic ethics. Here’s what happened… Ocasio-Cortez appeared on Tapper’s State of the Union Sunday and repeated the long-debunked lie that Trump described the coronavirus as a “hoax.” After Tapper was criticized online for not challenging or correcting her, he smugly took to Twitter and admitted he chose to allow her to lie to his audience, and then bizarrely blamed Trump for his own moral lapse. “I thought about it, because the president did not call the virus a hoax,” Tapper tweeted Sunday to someone who said he should have fact checked Ocasio-Cortez. “But I didn’t because he *did* call a hoax the concerns of those saying that the response from the president was insufficient and that he was downplaying the gravity of the crisis. And that too was a lie,” he added. Then came this jaw-dropping admission [emphasis added]: I guess that’s the problem with a politician who lies so often; while I agree that Democrats are mischaracterizing what he said, what he did say was also false so it’s tough to justify taking the time for a fact check when it’s not taking a stand defining the truth. It comes down to this… Jake Tapper remained silent in the face of lies and disinformation because he hates Trump, and then after getting caught, he responds and rationalizes by attacking Trump. And this is the second incident in just a few days that points to Tapper becoming increasingly unmoored. “If President Trump is not capable of leading stably and effectively, he should for the good of the country stop making things worse, and consider leaving the podium to others,” Tapper said on Thursday.  And let’s not forget Tapper identifies as an objective journalist. What set Tapper off was Trump ripping into NBC’s Peter Alexander during the president’s Thursday afternoon news briefing. But during his sanctimonious monologue calling for the president to go away, Tapper deliberately misled his miniscule audience. Instead of informing viewers of the full context of the exchange between Trump and Alexander, a seething Tapper lied about the exchange. Tapper chose to deceive his viewers by deliberately leaving out the key part of the exchange where Alexander interrupted, practically heckled, and accused the president of offering false hope. And now, Tapper is so unstable and frustrated, he’s allowing Democrats to come on his low-rated Sunday show and tell flat-out lies… Jake Tapper is allowing his own viewers to be misinformed.   All I can say is this… Never once in the 30 years I’ve been monitoring the media, have I ever seen a so-called journalist justify and practically brag about allowing what he knows are lies and disinformation to take place on his own news program.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"Four swing-state Senate Democrats up for reelection this year voted on Sunday against a bipartisan bill that would have provided immediate economic relief to Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. All four face tough reelection battles back home in their respective states. Senate Democrats unanimously rejected the “phase three” coronavirus package, which Senate Republican and Democrat congressional leaders, including the White House, have spent days negotiating the final details over. David Popp, the communications director for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), noted that congressional leaders filled the bill with bipartisan provisions designed to pass through the Senate with 60 votes. “There is no GOP bill,” Popp wrote. “There is one bill with a mountain of bipartisan stuff in it.” There is no GOP bill.

DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home. Those same candidates should prove they aren’t beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats’ unthinkable decision to filibuster. Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) Communications Director Calvin Moore said in a statement on Monday: Even facing the worst economic and public health crisis of our day, Washington Democrats cannot stop themselves from playing politics with people’s lives. Democrats would rather put lives on the line, cause irreparable damage to the American economy, and force small businesses to go belly up than do the right thing. Americans should be appalled. Retired general and New Hampshire Senate Republican candidate Don Bolduc said in a statement on Sunday that Shaheen’s vote against the coronavirus package was “shameful.” “It finally seemed as if Washington was going to put politics aside to get something done, but Sen. Shaheen couldn’t set her partisanship aside. Now, American families and businesses will have to wait for the relief they need. The economy will suffer,” Bolduc said. And Sen. Shaheen will stand with Pelosi instead of the American people. This isn’t about the next election. This is a national crisis. We don’t have time for Jeanne Shaheen’s stunts.

"ROME — Pope Francis offered special prayers Monday for those who are unable to work and earn money during the coronavirus lockdown affecting Italy and beyond. “Let us pray today for those persons who are beginning to experience economic problems due to the pandemic, because they cannot work. All of this affects the family,” the pope tweeted Monday. The majority of Italians have been without work at least since March 9, when Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared all of the Italian republic a “red zone,” confining people to their homes except for proven need. Even prior to the coronavirus outbreak, Italy was on the edge of a recession. Not only are most Italians no longer receiving an income, the government itself has seen its own tax revenues slashed as Italy’s number-one industry — tourism — has been suspended indefinitely and its massive manufacturing sector sits idle. More and more Italians are asking how the nation expects to come out of its present state of lockdown without devastating economic repercussions for millions of citizens. Some — even on the left — are beginning to question the legitimacy of “the greatest limitation of freedom in the history of the Republic” that was enacted without warning, debate, or parliamentary approval. From the outset, the coronavirus has been marked by “institutional disorder,” writes Alessandro De Angelis, vice-director of the Italian version of the Huffington Post, with government haphazardly issuing directives drip by drip (like Chinese water torture). The state reaction to the outbreak has resulted in no clear plan, he writes, but resembles “a distillate of collective anxiety.” What has many Italians on edge is the “temporal indeterminacy” of the lockdown, De Angelis insists, as officials refuse to assign a date to any return to normalcy. “The feeling is that a not indifferent political and social ‘experiment’ is being conducted in Italy, at least as a trend of the moment,” writes De Angelis, a self-described “leftist,” where democracy is exercised “as a regime of a leader called to manage the emergency, in a climate in which those who criticize the government are deemed traitors of the homeland in the face of the growing number of the dead, while propaganda by Big Brother is legitimate.” Only when the crisis has passed will it be possible to evaluate the adequacy of the measures taken and the unprecedented “limitation of fundamental freedoms,” De Angelis laments. The concerns voiced by Mr. De Angelis echo those expressed by a number of social commentators who suggest that the damage caused by a long-term lockdown could be worse than those of the virus itself. “If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine,” the editors of the Wall Street Journal wrote last Thursday. “This won’t be popular to read in some quarters, but federal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009.” The WSJ editors predict that a national shutdown could release “a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn’t true of millions of small and mid-sized firms.” “Perhaps we will be lucky, and the human and capitalist genius for innovation will produce a vaccine faster than expected—or at least treatments that reduce Covid-19 symptoms,” they observe. “But barring that, our leaders and our society will very soon need to shift their virus-fighting strategy to something that is sustainable.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome",Pope Francis Expresses Concerns over Economic Fallout of Coronavirus Crisis,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/23/pope-francis-expresses-concerns-over-economic-fallout-of-coronavirus-crisis/,Breitbart
"In reaction to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blocking a coronavirus package that would have provided economic relief to businesses and Americans amid the COVID-19 pandemic, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) slammed Pelosi for “playing political games.” McCarthy told “Fox & Friends” on Monday that Pelosi cannot craft another bill with members of the House because she is alone at the House at this time, adding her actions to block the bill and her claim she will introduce her own bill are “unacceptable.” “The things that they are asking for, they want to talk about election law, they want to talk about money that was going to places — think for one moment what we were able to do before. We’ve sent more money to the state, we increased the funding level there that we found time to work together,” McCarthy outlined. “This is actually to protect the jobs to provide more resources for what we need in dealing with this situation. Time is of the essence, but what’s so critical here is the actual senators, Democrats and Republicans, got together and crafted the bill. It is the leadership that has come in because they are unhappy that they couldn’t craft it themselves. This is the way our founders believe we should have written the bill and for them to hold up any process of moving forward is not even voting on the bill. It’s giving the 30 hours of debate to start moving. Chuck Schumer should allow the American public to be able to move forward, and this is unacceptable.” He later added, “[Pelosi] has no bill, she has no people, she has no members. That was a political ploy to give cover to Schumer to get his Democrats to vote no. This is a moment in time that those Democrat senators should not sit back and take the direction of leadership.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Monday that Chinese coronavirus cases in the state have soared 38 percent overnight to 20,875, thanks in part to more widespread testing. “This could go on for several months,” Cuomo said of the jump in cases during his daily press briefing. The governor noted approximately 13 percent of cases have been hospitalized thus far and 157 people have died. “Nobody can tell you is it four months, six months, eight months, nine months. But it is several months,” he stated. “We all have to now confront that that is a new reality. That is not going to change. You are not going to turn on the news tomorrow morning and they’re going to say surprise surprise this is all now resolved in two weeks.” New York has the most confirmed infections in the country, with New York City accounting for 12,305 of them. Cuomo estimated that up to 80 percent of the state’s 19.4 million residents will contract the illness but has said that “few will truly be in danger.” Cuomo also issued an emergency order Monday directing hospitals to increase their capacity by 50 percent. “I think it’s unreasonable to tell hospitals to double their capacity,” he said. “They must increase by 50 percent at least.” Meanwhile, the state is running clinical trials beginning Tuesday of the ant-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in response to testimonies that it is a possible treatment against the virus.","New York Confirms 20,875 Coronavirus Cases as Testing Ramps Up",2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/new-york-confirms-20875-coronavirus-cases-as-testing-ramps-up/,Breitbart
"Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said President Donald Trump was acting “very passive-aggressive” during the coronavirus pandemic, which is leaving a “void of leadership” that governors and mayors are attempting to fill. During Monday”s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” Emanuel said, “The country is begging for his leadership, and he is being very passive-aggressive in that leadership. I wish he’d spend less time lashing out either at a governor or a reporter who’s doing their job and more time lashing out and making sure that we have a focus on how to bring the country together and bring the resources to bear on this problem. I don’t think any nurse or any doctor should risk their health because they lack adequate masks, adequate protective gear, or the ability to provide a patient with a ventilator. I do think governors and mayors, university presidents, religious leaders, not-for-profits, citizens are stepping up because there is a void. And the unfortunate part is, you cannot solve this problem state by state, city by city jurisdiction. This is a national crisis that requires national leadership.” He added, “I actually think as a student, amateur student of presidential history and having worked for two presidents, crises reveal character. And this is a make-or-break moment for the country, and this is a make-or-break moment for President Trump. Now, I think every mayor and every governor has a role to play, but every one of them would want the national leadership that allows them to become effective administrators of their jurisdiction.

"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) on Monday explained he was able to quickly obtain a coronavirus test due to previously having a portion of his lung removed and asked for compassion amid criticism that he did not engage in social distancing before learning that he contracted the illness. “I believe we need more testing immediately, even among those without symptoms.  The nature of COVID-19 put me – and us all – in a Catch-22 situation.  I didn’t fit the criteria for testing or quarantine. I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person,” Paul said in a statement. “I had, however, traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate. That, together with the fact that I have a compromised lung, led me to seek testing.” Paul revealed in August that he had undergone surgery to remove a part of his lung damaged during his 2017 assault by a neighbor. Paul noted that despite the diagnosis, he remains asymptotic of the illness that has infected over 40,000 people and killed 479 in the United States. He then pushed back on criticism of his decision to undergo testing, arguing that had he not sought out a test, he may have still been interacting with others on Capitol Hill, putting them at risk of infection. “For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol. The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested,” Paul said. “Perhaps it is too much to ask that we simply have compassion for our fellow Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so. Thousands of people want testing. Many, like David Newman of The Walking Dead, are sick with flu symptoms and are being denied testing. This makes no sense. “The broader the testing and the less finger-pointing we have, the better.  America is strong. We are a resilient people, but we’re stronger when we stand together,” he concluded. In a Sunday statement, Paul’s deputy chief of staff, Sergio Gor, announced that the lawmaker had tested positive for the coronavirus. “He is feeling fine and is in quarantine,” Gor said. “He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.” Paul’s announcement came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) pulled out of negotiations on bipartisan rescue package aimed at alleviating the effects of the outbreak, and instead, announcing that she would push forward with her own plan.",Rand Paul Defends Swift Coronavirus Test: I Had Part of My Lung Removed Due to 2017 Assault,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/rand-paul-defends-quick-coronavirus-test-i-had-part-of-my-lung-removed-due-to-2017-assault/,Breitbart

The Senate Republican leader said that some Democrats told him in private they were embarrassed by Pelosi and Schumer’s political stunt. McConnell said Democrats “ought to be embarrassed.” He added, “In fact, I’ve heard from some who are embarrassed, talking like this is not some juicy political opportunity.”  “This is a national emergency,” he added. McConnell asked rhetorically, “Why are Democrats filibustering the bipartisan bill they helped write?” The Senate majority leader chastised Democrats for pushing their “wish list” of special interest provisions to be included in the bill.  McConnell explained, “Tax credits for solar energy and wind energy, provisions for employees to give special and new treatment to big labor? And listen to this: new emissions standards for the airlines. Are you kidding me? This is the moment to debate new regulations that have nothing whatsoever to do with this crisis?” He continued, “I’d like to see Democrats tell New York City doctors and nurses, who are literally overrun, that they are filibustering hospital funding for masks because they want to argue with the airlines over their carbon footprint.” “I’d like to see Senate Democrats tell seniors who have seen their hard-earned retirement savings literally melt away as the markets track toward their worst month since 1931,” McConnell said.

"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is issuing a “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order and prohibiting “all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring among persons outside a single household,” which will take effect at midnight, she announced on Monday. Whitmer emphasized that residents will still be able to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, bank, and gas station, as all of those places will remain open. “Workers that are necessary to sustain or protect life include those in health care and public health, law enforcement and public safety, grocery store workers, and more,” the announcement explains. However, Whitmer stresses that individuals “may only leave their home or place of residence under very limited circumstances, and they must adhere to social distancing measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when they do so.” That includes keeping a six-foot distance from others “to the extent feasible under the circumstances.” The order also limits “all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring among persons outside a single household.” Those are, per the order, “temporarily prohibited”: Additionally, under Executive Order 2020-21, all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring among persons outside a single household are temporarily prohibited. People may leave the house to perform for limited, necessary purposes, and may engage in outdoor activities like walking, hiking, running, cycling, or any other recreational activity, consistent with remaining at least six feet from people from outside a person’s household and with other restrictions imposed by prior executive orders. The order will last “for at least the next three weeks,” according to the announcement. “In just 13 days, we’ve gone from 0 to over 1,000 COVID-19 cases,” Whitmer said in a statement. “This is an unprecedented crisis that requires all of us working together to protect our families and our communities.” “The most effective way we can slow down the virus is to stay home. I know this will be hard, but it will be temporary,” she said. “If we all come together, get serious, and do our part by staying home, we can stay safe and save lives.”  Leaders in Ohio, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin are implementing similar stay-at-home orders.",Michigan Gov.

WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020  Yes! It’s at times like this that I’m reminded just how lucky we are — those of us who live in the U.S. and the UK at any rate — to have leaders whose default position tends towards liberty rather than authoritarianism. Some world leaders — Putin, definitely; Macron, President Bieber and others, probably — appear to be relishing the opportunity which the coronavirus pandemic has given them to flex their authoritarian muscles with draconian restrictions on freedom. It’s quite possible that President Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson may reluctantly have to go the same way. But the key part is this reluctance: both men want to get their nations as close to things were before as quickly as possible. Neither, I don’t think, is thinking: “Mwahahaha! Now is the chance to expand government beyond my wildest dreams.” In Boris Johnson’s case this liberal — in the old fashioned sense of the word — tendency is evident whenever he speaks about the new restrictions he feels it is necessary to impose on the country. It was with deep regret, for example, that Boris finally decided to follow the example of Spain, Italy and France and close restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, nightclubs, theatres, cinemas and gyms. Boris said he was reluctant to ‘go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people.’ ""We are taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub.

The restrictions we’re experiencing now would be just the beginning of their controlling masterplan to socialise everything. Instead, thank goodness, we find ourselves led by men — Trump and Boris — who are horrified rather than quietly delighted about the prospects of their countries being turned into borderline police states. Which is doubly important given how many of our commentators and members of the general public are being turned into obsessive, hysterical control freaks by this pandemic. Here, for example, is a radio show host called Tom Swarbrick dismissing ‘freedom’ as just another ‘ideology’ we can happily dispense with in this crisis.

"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) is accusing Democrats who blocked the Senate coronavirus stimulus bill of putting America on a path to “social destruction.” In a pair of tweets published late Sunday night, Romney exploded at Democrats who, after spending the weekend negotiating a compromise bill that was on the verge of passing with a bipartisan vote, appeared to change their minds after Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw a partisan bomb into the chamber. There is even talk that after five Republican senators were forced to go into quarantine, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saw this as an opportunity to gain the upper hand. If that’s the case, the word “cynicism” doesn’t begin to describe what just happened — and what just happened is that a bill that was meant to stabilize our economy and provide immediate relief to American workers and the companies that employ them was sabotaged for partisan reasons at the last minute. And Romney, who is one of the senators forced into quarantine, is not only furious; he’s sounding the alarm at the potential damage this could cause. “Nothing in the Senate has shocked me, until today,” Romney tweeted. “Standing in the way of a critically needed rescue package is irresponsible and reckless. Dems say not enough money to states: nearly $200 billion isn’t chump change. Hospitals get at least $75 billion.” “As for funds for companies, it’s to keep entities that employ millions of Americans from folding—it’s to save jobs,” he added in a second tweet. “Keep this up a little longer and we will go from social distancing to social destruction”: As for funds for companies, it’s to keep entities that employ millions of Americans from folding—it’s to save jobs.

Fox News’s Chad Pergram reported in real time “Collins lighting into Dems now. Says ‘the answer from my Democratic colleagues is delay, delay, delay.'” “As angry as she’s ever been on the Senate floor,” he added. The fake news media frequently hold Pelosi up as some sort of political genius. I’ve never really bought that, and I think the disaster that was impeachment only backs up my criticism. But this… This! What in the world did Pelosi think she was doing? We are in a situation where our economy is barreling towards a cliff, a situation where every day counts, and Pelosi pulled the football away at the very last minute… All that time and effort wasted. All those precious days wasted on negotiations and agreement between the two parties, just so Queen Nancy could swoop in at the last minute to hurl her partisan grenades and announce that Queen Pelosi Will Write Her Own Bill.  How long is that going to take? Pelosi is a multimillionaire. She can afford a shutdown. The rest of us are watching our retirement accounts melt away as our bank accounts dwindle because the same government that shut down our economy is not making us whole again because Queen Nancy feels like playing a fiddle to pervert a rescue bill into the Green New Deal. No, really… That’s what she wants to do. For once, I agree with Romney… Nothing in the Senate has shocked me, until today,” he said, and as cynical as I can be, never in a million years did I expect Democrats to screw the country with a kamikaze stunt like this one. Oh, and from his luxury bunker, Joe Biden supports Pelosi blocking this relief for Americans. FYI.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"Far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Sunday declared the bipartisan coronavirus economic relief package as “corrupt” and proclaimed that the GOP’s “greed & incompetence is going to get people killed” as Senate Democrats blocked aid to millions of American workers. “GOP *refusing to increase $ for hospitals,* but HAVE increased corporate bailout $,” Ocasio-Cortez said on Monday. “The Senate GOP plan is corrupt.” “Their greed & incompetence is going to get people killed. Others will be displaced, or unable to eat. They‘re holding our country hostage for a Wall St payday,” she added: “GOP *refusing to increase $ for hospitals,* but HAVE increased corporate bailout $.” The Senate GOP plan is corrupt.

They‘re holding our country hostage for a Wall St payday. https://t.co/lySpwfDNck — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 22, 2020  Democrats blocked the emergency package on Sunday, which fell 13 votes short of advancing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) suggested the negotiations in the Senate were “doing just fine” until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) interfered. As Breitbart News reported: An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package. “I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,” the Senate leader said on Sunday. McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.” “She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” he added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.” Both sides have since reached an impasse as Pelosi and Schumer are, demonstratively, heeding the advice of Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), who urged caucus members to view the aid package as a “tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision” during a conference call last week. McConnell met with Schumer, Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday. During that meeting, the House speaker reportedly “pushed a ‘laundry list’ of demands” that had little to nothing to do with economic relief needed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Politico reported: Pelosi pushed a “laundry list” of demands at that meeting, according to a GOP official, including a proposal to wipe off $10,000 from anyone who owns federal student loans, as well as election-security funding. The Republicans countered those issues were not germane to the stimulus debate; Democrats say they have insisted these matters needed to be discussed all along. While Republican lawmakers are scrambling to seal a deal to provide relief to the American people, a GOP aide also told Politico that Democrats are continuing in their attempts to “add a host of unrelated measures to the coronavirus package, including expanding collective bargaining power for unions, increased fuel emission standards for airlines and more wind and solar tax credits.”",AOC Says GOP ‘Greed & Incompetence’ Will ‘Get People Killed’ as Democrats Block Aid to U.S. Workers,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/aoc-says-gop-greed-incompetence-will-get-people-killed-as-democrats-block-aid-to-u-s-workers/,Breitbart
"Leading Conservative civil libertarian and Brexiteer David Davis has sounded the alarm over the government preparing to award itself wide-ranging special powers to fight the coronavirus pandemic, arguing they should be “open” with what is happening and why. While the response to the coronavirus outbreak in many countries has seen attacks on individual liberty in the name of public health nothing short of authoritarian, with many even in normally liberal and free countries welcoming crackdowns, some have urged caution over giving governments powers that are too broad and permanent. Most prominent in the United Kingdom, whose parliament is presently preparing to pass a significant package of emergency powers, is veteran Brexiteer and former Tory leadership contender David Davis. Described by the BBC as a “civil libertarian” who in 2008 resigned in protest over illiberal counter-terrorism legislation, Mr Davis has been leading the effort on introducing several amendments to the bill to increase accountability a sunset clause on its harsh rules. In an early victory for those concerned about the enormous scope of the emergency legislation, the government on Monday adopted an amendment Mr Davis had led a cross-party group of MPs to propose, stipulating that the new powers should be reviewed after six months, rather than two years as originally planned. This morning on @BBCr4today, https://t.co/swakuo886w at 7:13, I discussed advice received from Speaker’s Counsel confirming we can use existing powers to tackle this epidemic. This is that advice. pic.twitter.com/8YkNPsF3vJ — David Davis (@DavidDavisMP) March 23, 2020  This means Parliament will now be able to debate on and decide whether to renew the powers in six months time. But Mr Davis has warned the change doesn’t go far enough, as the amendment appears to merely give Parliament a binary choice to keep all powers unchanged or to do away will all of the powers at once. Without the ability to change the powers to incorporate what has been learnt in the next six months, or to slowly wind down powers rather than keeping them all at full strength, the six-monthly vote would be nothing more than a “rubber stamp” exercise, Davis said. The new legislation makes significant changes to medical law in the United Kingdom, and gives broad new powers to authorities, including the police being able to detain members of the public who have not committed a crime for weeks at a time over the possibility they may have coronavirus — even without symptoms. Another new power is the ability of a doctor to section an individual for mental health reasons without being required to have a second opinion, an enormous power for an individual to wield. The NHS is also to be protected against claims of medical negligence, which could make it impossible for bereaved families to challenge the NHS if relatives die in their care during the coronavirus outbreak. Introducing the legislation on Monday, Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock said of the powers: “[coronavirus is the] most serious public health emergency in a century… and to defeat it, we are proposing extraordinary measures never seen before in peacetime.” The law is expected to passed by the House of Commons in just one day, and signed off by the House of Lords later in the week. British Armed Forces to Start Delivering Food and Medical Supplies During Coronavirus Crisis https://t.co/SQsYxGX1tg — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2020  Such is the extent of this, Tory member of parliament Tom Tugendhat warned the government during Monday’s debate that such powers “could — in different circumstances — be used in a particularly malicious fashion.” Speaking on Monday morning, Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4 that given the speed with which the emergency law had been drafted it would inevitably be imperfect, and should be improved on when new experience and knowledge was developed in the coming months, rather than passed as a fait accompli and made permanent. He also questioned the need for the emergency legislation at all, noting that one of the most senior lawyers in Parliament had already issued advice that the public health emergency could be governed through Tony Blair’s 2004 Civil Contingencies Act. Speculating as to why the government wanted to pass fresh legislation rather than using the already very wide-ranging powers on the statute book, Mr Davis implied it could be down to wishing to avoid accountability at the hands of Parliament. He said: “[A]s it stands, we’re already using emergency powers under the 1984 Public Health Act, which was designed for epidemics. We could use the Civil Contingencies Act at the drop of a hat. The difficulty from the government’s point of view is they have to come back to Parliament and explain what they are doing, as they are doing it. And maybe they don’t want to do that.”",Libertarian Tories Sound Warning Over Lack of Safeguards on Coronavirus Emergency Powers,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/23/libertarian-tories-sound-warning-over-lack-of-safeguards-on-coronavirus-emergency-powers/,Breitbart
"China established two new “research stations” in the South China Sea on Yongshu [Fiery Cross Reef] and Zhubi [the Subi Reef], Beijing state news agency Xinhua reported this weekend — evidence China is surging forward with its colonization of the South China Sea while the world grapples with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Billed as scientific research stations, these military installations allegedly aim to study environmental conservation in the area, according to Beijing. Operating under the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Integrated Research Center for Islands and Reefs, both stations feature “monitoring systems” for conservation projects, according to Xinhua. The Chinese military has built “several real-time monitoring systems” on Fiery Cross Reef reportedly for coral reef ecosystem, vegetation ecology, and freshwater conservation. The Subi Reef research station reportedly has “completed the project design of monitoring systems” for geological disaster and freshwater conservation. Future research at the stations will focus on “ocean acidification, micro-plastic pollution, coral reef ecosystem conservation and marine disaster treatment.” The two new stations join the research center’s base at the “Meiji Research Center,” located at Meiji Reef [Panganiban Reef], established in 2018. According to Beijing, the research center aims to “promote innovation capability and the supply of public service products of marine science and technology to meet the needs of both China and other littoral countries around the South China Sea, making contributions to the building of a maritime community with a shared future.” Fiery Cross Reef and Subi Reef are both disputed territories claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. China has seized them and turned the reefs into artificial islands. China illegally claims territory in the South China Sea belonging to those three nations as well as Malaysia and Brunei and has claimed waters off the coasts of Indonesia’s Natuna Island. In January, Indonesia announced increased maritime patrols around islands in the South China Sea shortly after what it viewed as trespassing by Chinese coast guard vessels in Natuna waters. Commenting on the recent installations, maritime security expert Collin Koh told the Philippines’ Inquirer: Some may think that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic would have distracted Beijing from these maritime flashpoints … This is far from the case. The PLA (People’s Liberation Army) is touted to remain combat ready despite the coronavirus. Using these supposedly ‘civilian scientific’ endeavors to assert claim is one such modus operandi, and one that’s also often overlooked by all of us. Yet at the same time, the resulting strategic ramifications are not any less insignificant. The installations serve as the latest example of China’s efforts in recent years to transform reefs and islands in the South China Sea into strategic military outposts. Designed to monitor rival activities and establish an intimidating presence in the contested body of water, the military installations have been known to house communications facilities, airstrips, harbors, and missile shelters. Rich in oil and natural gas, the South China Sea contains some of the world’s most strategically important maritime territory. According to a 2015 State Department report, $5.3 trillion worth of goods passes through the South China Sea each year, accounting for about 30 percent of global maritime trade. In recent years, China has exerted increasing control in the South China Sea, claiming zones traditionally considered international territory, or as pertaining to nearby Southeast Asian nations. Many, including the United States, consider the move part of the country’s efforts to transform itself into a major global power. The U.S. has increased its presence in the South China Sea in recent years as well, aiding Southeast Asian nations in their efforts to fight China’s encroachment in the area. This show of force by the U.S. in the South China Sea has been met with resistance by China, escalating tensions in the area. Earlier in March, Chinese state media suggested the possibility of using an electromagnetic pulse weapon (EMP) against American ships entering the South China Sea. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague ruled against China in a territorial dispute with the Philippines in the South China Sea. In the landmark trial, the Philippines successfully argued that China had illegally seized its maritime territory. China rejected the 2016 ruling by the international tribunal and continues to assert its claim over almost the entirety of the South China Sea. According to the 2016 ruling, China broke international law by damaging the marine environment — it dredged up underwater sediment to construct islands large enough to support military installations. This casts doubt on China’s claims that its new research facilities were built for purposes of environmental conservation. China’s latest show of force in the South China Sea comes amid international condemnation for the communist nation, responsible for the current Chinese coronavirus pandemic, a global crisis ravaging the world’s economy and public health. Authorities have criticized China’s slow response to the coronavirus, originating in Wuhan, China, at the end of last year. At press time Monday, the Chinese coronavirus had infected 367,457 people and killed 16,097 people globally.",China Debuts ‘Research Stations’ in South China Sea While World Battles Coronavirus,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/23/china-debuts-research-stations-in-south-china-sea-while-world-battles-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Monday attacked Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) after the Maine lawmaker criticized Democrats for blocking a bipartisan economic relief package.

She helped drive the lack of preparation that we had leading up to this.” “What’s actually disgraceful is her ‘I’m a Moderate Lady’ dance to cover up brutal policies and vote,” she added, listing examples in an attempt to back her point: Collins voted for the GOP tax scam.She voted to appoint Kavanaugh.She’s defending an utterly corrupt bill to shower public money on friends and donors.

We don’t have another hour. We don’t have another minute to delay acting,” she said, detailing the small businesses in her own state impacted by the pandemic. Together, lawmakers came up with a “very good plan” and “worked in a bipartisan way … that would help these small businesses and keep their employees paid,” Collins said. Keep their employees getting paychecks,” she added. “How can that possibly be controversial?” she asked. “How can any of us want to see millions of Americans lose their paychecks, their health insurance, their contributions to their retirement plans?” “Mr. President, I cannot believe the objections to proceeding to this package,” she said, calling it “disgraceful.” “This is disgraceful.

"Monday, White House National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow emphasized the importance of getting the coronavirus economic relief bill passed. Kudlow said the Exchange Stabilization Fund will be “transparent,” shooting down the notion of it being a “slush fund,” which is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and other Senate Democrats are referring to it as. He added that the money would get liquidity and credit into the economy. “Senator Schumer should be able to come to an agreement on that,” Kudlow told Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” host Ed Henry. “That’s the ESF fund that I’m talking about. So, the nub of the whole issue is to get the Federal Reserve lending and some other things, it’s not a slush fund. Look, that will get money to small and medium-sized businesses, OK? It will also get money to key parts of the economy that are distressed. There’s nothing slush about that. It’ll all be done transparently, no question about that. But we’re going to give, you know, the direct checks to the workers that’s very, very important. We’ve helped out people that have to stay at home because of the virus, that’s very, very important. We have a loan guarantee program for small businesses, it may take a little more time, but that’s very important. We’ve got direct deposit from the IRS into individual men and women, whatever it is, 3,000 bucks a family.” He continued, “But on this so-called slush fund, they want to be very clear, this is something that is the corner, the keystone, when we get that done and it will be transparent, the treasury will run it with the Fed, it will inject liquidity. It’s probably, Ed, the fastest way to get liquidity and credit into the economy, into all these sections. I mean the Fed’s opened it up, I’m just going to read it to you: Student loans, automobile loans, credit card loans, small business loans, money market loans, corporate bonds, this is what will keep us whole while we hope and pray that the virus flattens out in the weeks ahead.” Kudlow also voiced his disbelief Democrats blocked the bill. “I just can’t believe that the other side of the aisle won’t help us on this.

"In the final analysis, mortality rates for coronavirus originally cited by President Donald Trump are going to be proven more accurate than the higher numbers claimed by the World Health Organization, according to an Israeli expert in epidemic modeling. “Do you know what’s most absurd?” asked Dr. Dan Yamin. “That in the final analysis Trump was right. Not that the coronavirus is just plain flu – it absolutely isn’t – but as he put it: ‘This is just my hunch – way under 1 percent’ [will die].’” Yamin heads the Laboratory for Epidemic Modeling and Analysis in Tel Aviv University’s engineering faculty, where he has developed models for predicting the spread of infectious diseases. In an interview with Israel’s Haaretz newspaper, Yamin agreed with Trump’s assessment earlier this month that the World Health Organization’s 3.4 % global fatality rate for coronavirus is too high. “Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number,” Trump told Fox News on March 4. “Now, this is just my hunch,” Trump said. “Based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild – they’ll get better very rapidly, they don’t even see a doctor, they don’t even call a doctor.” “You never hear about those people, so you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population, in terms of this corona flu, and/or virus. So you just can’t do that.” Trump added: So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California — I believe you had one in New York — you know, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4%, which is a very high number, as opposed to — as opposed to a fraction of 1%. But, again, they don’t — they don’t know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don’t go to the hospital. They don’t report to doctors or the hospital in many cases. Yamin questioned the data being used to divine global mortality rates. “When we look at the dry data, we see a very high mortality rate, of 4 to 7 percent, in countries like Italy and Spain, alongside far lower numbers in countries like Germany and South Korea. “And then there’s China, though it’s very difficult to believe the numbers coming out of there – and in any event no country in the West can allow itself to adopt the measures that China adopted to contain the spread. Now ask yourself: How do you check the mortality rate in all those countries? You take the total number of deaths and divide it by the total of reported patients.” Asked whether the research for mortality rates was biased, Yamin responded that it is “very biased.” The doctor continued: If I can only carry out few tests, I will test those who have the highest chance of becoming ill, and then, when I check the mortality rate among them, I will get very high numbers. But there is one country we can learn from: South Korea. South Korea has been coping with corona for a long time, more than most Western countries, and they lead in the number of tests per capita. Therefore, the official mortality rate there is 0.9 percent. But even in South Korea, not all the infected were tested – most have very mild symptoms. The actual number of people who are sick with the virus in South Korea is at least double what’s being reported, so the chance of dying is at least twice as low, standing at about 0.45 percent – very far from the World Health Organization’s [global mortality] figure of 3.4 percent. And that’s already a reason for cautious optimism. Yamin joins a chorus of other experts who agree that the mortality rate is likely lower than the WHO estimate and that as more testing is carried out the rate will fall. “I think Trump is right,” said Paul A. Offit, who holds the Maurice R. Hilleman Chair of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania. Gary Kobinger, director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec, pointed to mild or symptom-free infection numbers and said it would be unusual if those cases were not being missed. “There are mild cases that are undetected. This is why it’s spreading. Otherwise it would not be spreading because we would know where those cases are and they would be contained and that would be the end of it,” Kobinger told health website STAT. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of Trump’s coronavirus taskforce and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, coauthored an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine arguing the mortality could be less than 1% due to the large number of people whose cases went unreported. Fauci surmised that if the death rate is indeed lower then “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza.” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"Democrats blocked for the second time in 24 hours a bill that would have provided immediate economic relief to American workers and businesses suffering from the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate blocked a motion to cloture to advance the coronavirus package for debate.

Doug Jones (D-AL) previously voted against the motion but voted in favor of advancing the legislation. Democrats blocked a procedural motion that would have advanced the Senate “phase three” package that would provide aids to small businesses and direct cash payments to Americans laid off during the coronavirus package. Democrats and Republicans crafted the legislation after long negotiations. Then at the last minute, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) walked away from the negotiation table to craft her own bill. David Popp, the communications director for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), noted that congressional leaders filled the bill with bipartisan provisions designed to pass through the Senate with 60 votes. “There is no GOP bill,” Popp wrote. “There is one bill with a mountain of bipartisan stuff in it.” Senate Majority Leader McConnell chastised Democrats on the Senate floor on Monday morning, noting that, in private, some Democrats told him that they were “embarrassed” by Pelosi’s decision to halt bipartisan negotiations on the coronavirus. McConnell said Democrats “ought to be embarrassed.” He added, “In fact, I’ve heard from some who are embarrassed, talking like this is not some juicy political opportunity.” “This is a national emergency,” he added. McConnell asked rhetorically, “Why are Democrats filibustering the bipartisan bill they helped write?” Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) noted on the Senate floor on Monday that she had worked closely with Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) on the $350 billion provisions to provide small businesses relief in the coronavirus package.

We did so after 9/11. We did so with the financial meltdown in 2008.

"Joe Biden’s new foray into regular video updates about coronavirus stumbled out of the gate as the teleprompter malfunctioned and he called the sitting Massachusetts governor by the wrong name. Biden was speaking behind a podium when he began verbally stumbling around, as if he wasn’t sure what to say, or was buying time. “Beef up the number of responders dealing with the crush — these crush of cases. And, uh, and in addition to that,” he said, looking down at his notes, before he waved his hand upward under the podium to conceal it. “And in addition to that we to, um, make sure that we, uh, we are in a position that we are, well, let me go to the second thing. I spoke enough of that,” Biden said, before trying to move on from the blunder. Biden called the current Massachusetts governor “Charlie Parker,” a jazz saxophonist from the 1950s. Charlie Baker was elected governor of the commonwealth in 2014. He began the speech on coronavirus by touching his nose and brushing his upper lip: This was Biden’s first of what he said would be many video appearances.

"California’s coronavirus policy has reached a point of contradiction: the state is releasing inmates from its jails to prevent the spread of coronavirus in close quarters, while at the same time moving homeless people to recreation centers in residential areas. The Los Angeles Times reports: More California counties are releasing inmates to protect their jails againstpossible coronavirus outbreaks. In Alameda County, officials announced 247 people were being released from the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. San Diego County officials have announced similar moves, as have San Francisco, San Mateo and other counties. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has reduced its inmate population by 6% in the last three weeks and Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey said her office would consider reducing bail for thousands of nonviolent offenders. There were no confirmed coronavirus cases inside L.A. County jails as of Thursday, the Times notes. But on Friday, the city began implementing a plan to move thousands of homeless people into temporary shelters inside recreational buildings in residential areas. The plan is opposed even by some homeless people, who fear they will be more susceptible to coronavirus inside shelters — even with beds 6 feet apart — than in the open. Officials are struggling to prevent a coronavirus outbreak among homeless people who a live in crowded makeshift encampments alongside streets and in vacant lots. They are also trying to create space for “social distancing” inside existing homeless shelters by relocating residents. Joel B.

The bill includes a wish list of Democrats’ pet issues including: (A) make and achieve a binding commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the domestic flights of such air carrier in every calendar year, beginning with 2021, on a path consistent with a 25 percent reduction in the aviation sector’s emissions from 2005 levels by 2035, and a 50 percent reduction in the sector’s emissions from 2005 levels by 2050, applying the standards, recommended practices, and guidance agreed to by the United States pursuant to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act of 2011 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other lawmakers specifically called out Democrats for trying to negotiate the expansion of wind and solar tax credits in the bill. The bell demands that corporate recipients of financial assistance are required to report racial and gender data regarding salaries, number of employees, supplier diversity, and membership on corporate boards. It also requires federal agencies to use businesses and financial institutions owned by minorities or women.

"President Trump called on the nation to protect the Asian-American community, citing “nasty language” to Asian Americans due to the coronavirus originating in China and the misconception that Asian Americans are to blame. “It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world,” he said Monday during a White House press briefing. “They’re amazing people. And the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, s, or form,” he added. Leftists have claimed that Trump’s usage of the words “Chinese virus” to describe the coronavirus is instigating racism against Asian Americans. Trump said he uses the term because the virus came from Wuhan, China. China has been trying to deny that the virus originated in China and has even blamed U.S. Army soldiers for bringing it to Wuhan. Several cases of racism in the U.S. have been reported, although some appear to be perpetuated by other minorities against Asian Americans. Trump also tweeted earlier on Monday: It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world.

They love our country and I’m not going to let it happen,” he said. “They are making statements to Great American citizens that happen to be of Asian heritage and I’m not going to let that happen.” “They’re working closely with us to get rid of it,” he said. “We will prevail together.

"The Navy on Monday deployed a massive hospital ship to Los Angeles to help local authorities deal with the strain of battling the coronavirus, at the direction of President Trump. The USNS Mercy will not be taking coronavirus patients, but can use its 1,000 hospital beds to help free up more beds in Los Angeles should they be needed for coronavirus patients. The ship’s commander, Navy Capt. Jonathan Rotruck, said during a press briefing Monday: The Mercy brings a team of medical professionals, medical equipment, and supplies, all of which will act in essence, as a relief valve for local civilian hospitals in the Los Angeles area so that local health professionals can better focus on COVID-19 cases. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who made the request for the Mercy to dock in Los Angeles, praised the president for his speedy help. “President Trump has approved our request to deploy the #USNSMercy to Los Angeles.

It will carry 1,128 active duty Navy medical staff, about 60 Navy reservists, and a small number of contractors to operate the ship. Navy officials said the ship would take “within a week” to arrive in Los Angeles from San Diego. “We will be ready on arrival to support FEMA, state and local agencies’ efforts to protect the health of the American people in this whole-of-government approach directed by the president of the United States,” Rotruck said. He said the ship will dock in Los Angeles for as long as it is needed, or assigned elsewhere. The ship will pull into the Port of Los Angelea and transport patients by ground onto the ship, he said. “We will stay there for as long as it makes sense,” said Navy Capt. Dan Cobian, the mission’s commander. According to the County of Los Angeles Public Health, there are, as of Monday, 536 cases and seven deaths in Los Angeles County. Navy officials said the crew will be taking proactive measures to make sure that anyone coming aboard is properly screened for COVID-19. Navy Rear Adm. Timothy H. Weber, commander of the Naval Medical Corps Pacific and director of the Medical Service Corps, said during the briefing, “We are honored to answer the call in a time of need.” “Today is a big day for the Mercy, Navy medicine and our national response to the coronavirus,” Rotruck added. The president last week directed the Mercy and a sister hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, to deploy in response to the coronavirus crisis.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) plan to fight the coronavirus includes giving millions in American taxpayer funding to refugees living overseas. Pelosi, along with House Democrats, blocked passage of a coronavirus relief package for American workers, citizens, and small businesses in favor of their own plan that increases taxpayer funding to foreign refugees. Included in Pelosi’s plan is a designation of $300 million in American taxpayer money to foreign refugees:   (Text of House Democrats’ coronavirus plan) In comparison, for example, Pelosi’s plan only gives about $100 million in additional funds for runaways and homeless youth in the U.S. and only an extra $15 million to the “Veterans Employment and Training” office to help respond to the health crisis. Taxpayer money for foreign refugees is also about $100 million more than what Pelosi’s plan specifically designates for the emergency food and shelter program under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.

"Monday, during an appearance on Fox News, Vice President Mike Pence applauded how the country was coming together, including mentioning the contributions from the business community, to take on coronavirus as it continues to spread and impair the country. He cited the extraordinary action of President Donald Trump invoking the Defense Production Act, but also noted efforts from 3M, Facebook and Anheuser-Busch. “You know, the president — he invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the president the authority to mandate production during times of national crisis in the defense of the nation,” he said. “In fact, today, when the president signed the executive order, regarding — giving the Justice Department authority to thoroughly prosecute people engaged in price-gouging and hoarding, that came from the Defense Production Act. But we have been asked several times about whether the president will invoke this. Will he mandate businesses?”  “But the truth is — and this just makes me smile and makes me proud as an American — every business we have asked to step up and do their part has said yes,” Pence continued. “No one has said no yet. I mean, we have seen, again, 3M today delivered 500,000 respirator masks to New York and Seattle. Facebook just donated from their reserve more than three-quarters-of-a-million masks to health care workers. Anheuser-Busch is switching some of their manufacturing and distributing networks to produce large amounts of hand sanitizer.” The vice president highlighted how the cooperation from the business community would contribute to overcoming the coronavirus threat. “I mean, Americans are rising to the challenge,” Pence said. “They’re embracing the 15 days to slow the spread. They know that it’s about protecting the most vulnerable among us. But American business is also rising to the challenge. And, Sean, I can just tell all of your listeners all across America, we can do this. And it’s going to take all of us. As the president has said many times, we’re all in this together.” “But I’m absolutely convinced, with the cooperation of the American people, with the compassion and care of our health care workers, with the — with the full engagement of American free enterprise, the partnership that — with our states, all of our great federal leaders, and the prayers of millions of Americans, we can slow the spread, we can protect our most vulnerable, and we can heal our land,” he added.

"The White House Legislative Affairs Office is reportedly asking Congress to pass legislation that would provide an early release to thousands of felons 60 years old and older in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. On Sunday, President Donald Trump told the media that his administration was reviewing a plan to free elderly felons deemed “nonviolent” from federal prison to try to prevent a spread of the Chinese coronavirus in prison. “We have been asked about that and we’re going to take a look at it,” Trump said. “It’s a bit of a problem, but when we talk about totally nonviolent, we’re talking about releasing totally nonviolent prisoners, we are actually looking at that, yes.” The plan, lobbied for by the George Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has the potential of releasing about 10,000 elderly felons from federal prisons over fears that they could contract the coronavirus while incarcerated. These felons are considered “nonviolent,” though violent criminals often plead down to nonviolent crimes to shorten their prison sentences. Federal data released in 2018 revealed that more than 97 percent of federal convicts had taken plea deals rather than going to trial for all the crimes they had been charged with in their criminal cases. Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz reports having obtained a letter that the White House Legislative Affairs Office sent to a number of Republican Senators, asking that they immediately pass H.R. 4018 to give early release to thousands of elderly felons: On Saturday, the White House office of legislative affairs sent a message to Senate staff requesting they pass H.R. 4018, a bill to grant federal prisoners over the age of 60 early release, “as soon as possible.” In case you thought the convoluted logic of using the coronavirus crisis to push the jailbreak agenda was limited to big-city liberal politicians in Baltimore and California, this memo made clear there are those in the White House pushing it. [Emphasis added] “Older inmates are at a unique risk to be affected by the Coronavirus,” read the email from the White House legislative affairs office, which I obtained from a Republican Senate office. “A congressional fix to allow older inmates to be placed in home confinement can help reduce the risk of community spread in a crowded environment.” [Emphasis added] Already, major areas like Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; and Cleveland, Ohio, have started releasing hundreds of inmates from local and state prisons — steps their law enforcement officials said are necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police officers have been advised to stop imprisoning criminals accused of “nonviolent” crimes. This list of crimes includes burglary, auto theft, vandalism, prostitution, and theft. The White House did not respond to a request for comment in time for this publication.

"Members of Congress should be required to place their investments into blind trusts to avoid conflicts of interest, insider trading, and other forms of corruption related to their appropriations of taxpayer funds, said Peter Schweizer, senior contributor to Breitbart News and author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite. Schweizer offered his recommendation on Monday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. The two discussed Sen. Richard Burr’s (R-NC) recent selling of between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stock ahead of coronavirus-related market declines. Congress’s access to information not made available to the public — via confidential briefings and other means — opens the door to insider trading, noted Schweizer, additionally highlighting Congress’s power to affect markets given its control of government appropriations. Broad public distrust of Congress arises from people’s knowledge of representatives and senators making self-interested funding decisions that benefit their portfolios and financial interests. “Here’s the problem,” said Schweizer, addressing proposed relief funds for airline companies and other industries particularly damaged by the coronavirus pandemic, “members of Congress can trade stock in Delta Airlines or Boeing while they’re working on this bailout — while they’re voting on it — and it just throws the integrity of the whole process into question.” Schweizer added, “Members of Congress, is it worth it to have the American people distrust you so you can make some extra side money by insider trading on the market? Because that’s really ultimately what this is about. There’s no legitimate explanation or reason that they can give for them not to be required to put their assets in a blind trust.” LISTEN:  Schweizer reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Burr’s stock dump and to prosecute the North Carolina senator for insider trading based on violations of the STOCK Act.

"Roughly half of America approves of the job that President Donald Trump is doing to combat the coronavirus pandemic. A new poll released by Monmouth University on Monday indicates that 50 percent of Americans across the country believe the president is doing a good job in handling the crisis, compared to 45 percent who do not. When broken down along partisan lines, Trump’s performance was rated significantly better among Republicans (89 percent) and independents (48 percent) than Democrats, only 19 percent of whom thought the president was doing a good job. Despite the partisan divergence, Trump’s management of the crisis was viewed more than favorable than that of both congress (42 percent) and the media (45 percent). In fact, the president only trailed the nation’s governors and federal health agencies when it came to who was handling the pandemic best. The poll, which was conducted between March 18 through 22 by surveying 851 individuals nationally, is the first to come out since the coronavirus pandemic forced non-essential businesses, schools, and other venues to shut down across the country. Trump, for his part, has taken an active approach in leading the U.S.’s efforts to fight the pandemic. The president was an early proponent of banning travel to-and-from China, where the coronavirus first appeared. Since then, the president has expanded his travel ban to include Europe and Canada, which have seen massive increases over the past three weeks. In recent days, the Trump administration has also been negotiating with congress on a relief package for small businesses and workers impacted by the efforts taken to mitigate the contagion’s spread. The public seems to be taking notice of such efforts. The Monmouth poll found that the president’s overall approval rating had climbed since the coronavirus outbreak. In February, Monmouth indicated that only 44 percent of voters approved of the job Trump was doing in the White House, while 50 percent disapproved. This month, however, those numbers rose sharply, with 46 percent approving of the job Trump was doing, while only 48 percent disapproved.",Monmouth Poll: Half of America Approves of Trump’s Coronavirus Response,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/23/monmouth-poll-half-america-approve-trumps-coronavirus-response/,Breitbart
"On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) defended House Democrats pushing for voting by mail and early voting in their coronavirus relief bill because such proposals are part of protecting the health of democracy, and “we view the economic health and the health of our democracy as very much interrelated.” Host Chris Hayes asked Schiff about the criticism that Democrats “sort of see this opportunity to get a bunch of stuff you wanted anyway, in under the cover of emergency legislation. What’s your response to that?” Schiff responded, “I think what they’re really focused on is, we want to make sure that we protect, not only the health of the economy, but the health of our democracy. And for that reason, we want to make sure that we provide that people can vote by mail, and have early voting. We saw the fiasco in Ohio. We don’t want that repeated.

"A career criminal is accused of robbing and threatening to murder a woman at knifepoint after he was released from state prison thanks to a nationwide jailbreak push in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. On March 17, according to Utah law enforcement officials, 42-year-old Joshua Haskell was released from a halfway house over a plan to free inmates deemed “non-violent” to stop the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Haskell had previously been freed from Utah State Prison after serving time for drug crimes and a parole violation. Two days after his release from the halfway house, Haskell allegedly entered a woman’s home while she was sleeping and awakened her, yelling at her that if she did not stop screaming he was “going to cut her head off,” according to an affidavit obtained by Desert News. This is when police said Haskell tied the woman up, binding her wrists and ankles, and demanded that she give him her cash money, credit cards, and the PIN numbers for the cards. Haskell allegedly threatened to return to the house and kill the woman if she gave him the wrong PIN numbers. The woman’s son heard his mother screaming from the bedroom and called police officers. Haskell allegedly told the woman to tell the police that he was her partner when the police arrived. As Haskell got into bed, the woman ran downstairs toward police officers. Police arrested Haskell at gunpoint and found drugs and drug paraphernalia on him. In the affidavit obtained by Desert News, the woman told police officers “she was sure she was going to die and that she was just waiting for the suspect to stab her.” Haskell has a long criminal record which includes at least four convictions for drug crimes. Now, the career criminal has been charged with aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, aggravated kidnapping, drug possession, and possession of a weapon. The incident comes as cities across the United States have implemented plans to release state prisoners that they consider “non-violent” under the guise of coronavirus potentially spreading in prison among inmates. While Philadelphia, Pennsylvania police officers have been advised to free suspects accused of “non-violent” crimes, the George Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has asked the Justice Department to release 10,000 felons from federal prison in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.

"Planned Parenthood is defying an Ohio order to discontinue elective abortions during the coronavirus pandemic, even though its abortion clinics are using up valuable personal protective equipment (PPE) that is needed by medical personnel who are treating the infection caused by the virus. Pro-life organization Created Equal produced a video of recorded phone requests for information from abortion facilities regarding the decision to continue with “business as usual” during the pandemic:  Mark Harrington, president of Created Equal, said: The abortion industry claims they perform health care. However, we have evidence that abortion centers across the nation are staying open in the midst of this national health crisis, risking public health and safety. These centers must close their doors to help stop the spread of COVID-19. If they believe in the health of Americans, they have no other choice. Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio, for example, is refusing to comply with an order by the state’s attorney general that bans nonessential and elective surgical procedures, such as abortions, during the coronavirus pandemic. A lawyer for the abortion facility responded to a letter from the office of state Attorney General Dave Yost, asserting the order allows Planned Parenthood to “still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion.” “This is not about abortions,” Bethany McCorkle, a spokesperson for Yost, reportedly told CBS News on Sunday. “This is about nonessential surgeries using PPE [personal protective equipment] during this pandemic.” Women’s Med Center of Dayton also refused to comply with the order to stop abortions, reported the Dayton Daily News, adding Planned Parenthood said it is “taking steps to reduce the use of personal protective equipment and is complying with the state order because abortion is an essential, time-sensitive medical procedure.” Abortion is essential for people’s health and wellbeing. That’s why clinic  doors are staying open. https://t.co/lv55KmompW — NARAL (@NARAL) March 22, 2020  Pro-life organizations that have long documented the unsanitary conditions at abortion clinics, however, fear “steps to reduce the use” of PPE during abortions will further compromise the safety of women and cause the continued spread of the coronavirus. In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, said: COVID-19 and the national crisis it has prompted remind us of so many truths the abortion lobby would rather we forget. Abortion companies always put their profits over their patients’ health. Abortion clinics are dirty and dangerous. Abortion is violence, not healthcare. The sheer selfishness on display by abortionists refusing to close shop even for a brief time to funnel every possible resource to the brave medical providers on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus – not to mention putting women at greater risk – is simply unconscionable. Operation Rescue also noted that abortion facilities that are “not known for adhering to infection control protocols even in normal times — are staying open despite the very real threat of spreading the China Virus, COVID-19.” The group’s president, Troy Newman, said: While our schools, businesses, and churches are closed, abortion businesses are not only staying open, but are in active defiance and trying to increase the number of abortions done. For these people, today’s National Emergency is nothing more than an opportunity for profit-taking, no matter who it hurts. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has also moved to stop abortions in his state in order to make critical medical supplies available to those healthcare workers caring for victims of the coronavirus. The order states hospitals may only perform surgeries if the patient faces an immediate risk for “serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician.” We must work together as Texans to stop the spread of COVID-19 & ensure that our health care professionals & facilities have all the resources they need to fight the virus. Those who violate @GovAbbott's order will be met with the full force of the law.https://t.co/B5agHEh3Jq — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) March 23, 2020  Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office confirmed Monday Abbott’s order states: “[A]ll licensed health care professionals and all licensed health care facilities shall postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician.” This prohibition applies throughout the State and to all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary, including routine dermatological, ophthalmological, and dental procedures, as well as most scheduled healthcare procedures that are not immediately medically necessary such as orthopedic surgeries or any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. In a video message, Texas-based former Planned Parenthood manager-turned pro-life activist Abby Johnson urged all governors to close abortion clinics, asserting “they are providing non-essential, elective procedures and taking up precious resources that need to be used elsewhere.” The founder and director of And Then There Were None, an organization the helps abortion workers leave their jobs, continued: It’s not just about abortion, all elective surgeries right now should be stopped if they are using up valuable PPE. Hospitals need that protective equipment and it should be used to treat patients who have the coronavirus, not on any elective procedure. Both medical and surgical abortion require PPE. The abortion industry’s protocol, even on medication abortions, require ultrasounds, where PPE are used, and the women must have a follow up appointment to make sure the baby has passed. Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins also called for all abortion facilities to be closed down during the coronavirus crisis and is using the hashtag #StopTheSpread to call greater attention to the need: At a time when many areas are facing medical supply shortages and taxpayer dollars are being redirected to address the consequences of the coronavirus, we urge every governor to order abortion facilities closed in order to redirect medical personnel and supplies towards real healthcare. It makes no sense that Planned Parenthood and other abortion facilities should remain open to commit abortions, as abortion is never essential. While millions of medical professionals across the country are scrambling to find necessary supplies, we urge every governor to order abortion facilities to cease abortions and to donate their taxpayer-funded, necessary medical supplies to local hospitals and clinics that need it to provide real life-saving care. Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said Planned Parenthood is doing the opposite of most of the country. “Planned Parenthood is … defying lawful directives and continuing to put abortion and profits before health and safety,” she said. “In doing so, they are also contributing to deficits in our nation’s supply of personal protective equipment. In addition, through surgical and chemical abortion, they are putting women at risk for complications that will further overwhelm hospital emergency rooms during this already trying time.”",Planned Parenthood: Abortions ‘Business as Usual’ During Coronavirus,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/planned-parenthood-abortions-business-as-usual-during-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump said Monday that he would continue to listen to advice from federal government doctors but would ultimately make his own decisions about the future of the economy, as the fight against the coronavirus continues. “Ultimately, I have to make a decision, but I certainly listen to them,” Trump said when asked if he would follow the advice of Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx about loosening national guidelines restricting the behavior of the American people. The president spoke with reporters for over an hour and a half during a White House press briefing on Monday evening. Trump said he had “respect” for Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx but suggested that they would likely err on the side of caution. “If it were up to the doctors, they may say, ‘Let’s keep it shut down, let’s shut down the entire world … and let’s keep it shut for a couple of years,'” he said. “We can’t do that.” When asked if Fauci agreed with him that the economy should open soon, Trump replied, “He doesn’t not agree with me.” But the president said that he would be the one making decisions about the future, citing his “double obligation” to the American people. He also warned about the rising mortality rate as a result of losing the American economy: We have people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death probably, definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers we’re talking about with regard to the virus. He compared the mortality rates for suicides, car crashes, and the ordinary flu to the coronavirus death rate and said that had to be weighed before making a decision. “The whole concept of death is terrible,” Trump said. “But there’s a tremendous difference between one percent and four or five.” The president ultimately said that America could keep the economy going and fight the virus and said it would be irresponsible to shut down the country longer than necessary. “We’re going to come up with a date and we’re going to do two things,” he said. “We can do two things at one time. At the same time, we’re going to be very vigilant.” Trump said the tough restrictions on Americans would be “weeks not months” and said updated guidelines eventually might vary for certain age groups and different hot spots in the country.",Donald Trump: I Will Listen to Doctors but Make My Own Decisions About the Economy,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/onald-trump-i-will-listen-to-doctors-make-my-own-decisions-about-the-country/,Breitbart
"The FBI found more Hillary Clinton emails. This is, of course, after the State Department assured us long ago it had produced all releasable Clinton emails, including emails recovered by the FBI that Clinton tried to destroy or withhold. We released 80 pages of emails that further document how former Secretary of State Clinton used her unsecure, non-government email system to transmit classified and other sensitive government information. There are 11 new Clinton emails. The emails include one sent by Clinton a month after the Benghazi terrorist attack referencing a “Benghazi security” issue. The emails also include talking points, which are redacted, for a meeting with President Obama. This is the second release from the batch of Clinton emails the FBI inexplicably found late last year The State Department previously claimed it had produced all releasable Clinton emails, including emails recovered by the FBI that Clinton tried to destroy or withhold. The State Department initially claimed all responsive emails had been produced in 2018, but then found more emails, which were produced for the first time early this year. The emails were produced to us in a FOIA lawsuit we filed seeking all of Clinton’s government emails sent or received on her non-government system (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00687)). The new emails include an October 13, 2012, message from Clinton telling private attorney Robert Barnett about a conversation with Jake Sullivan, Clinton’s senior advisor and deputy chief of staff, about Benghazi: “Jake and I were discussing the Benghazi security issue since he tried to tell [Redacted] would be asked about it but they didn’t think so. Might be good for you to call Jake too.” Clinton also mentions then-candidate Mitt Romney’s “47% remark,” referring to his dismissal of Obama voters as irresponsible. On August 29, 2011, Sullivan sends a “cheat sheet” with “key issues” to Clinton, Abedin and Clinton’s confidential assistant Monica Hanley including “Talking Points for POTUS” for a briefing that day. The talking points are completely redacted. The new email cache includes an email dated August 31, 2011, that former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman sends to former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, William Burns and others, which is heavily redacted as classified. Burns forwards the email to Sullivan. Sullivan forwards it to Clinton’s private email, and she responds: “I called him [redacted.] Didn’t you get memcon?” On December 22, 2009, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson emails Clinton “directly … rather than Sid [likely Sidney Blumenthal]” about Afghanistan, disparaging “cost plus contractors” and promoting his company, Symbion Power. Wilson includes a memo from his boss, an Inspector General audit of USAID in Afghanistan’s power sector activities and a memo of USAID management’s comments regarding the audit. Clinton forwards the email to Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Jacob Lew, Mills and Sullivan with the following instructions: Please check out what Joe is saying here. He is now working for a company that has a good track record building in Iraq and wants to do so in Afghanistan. Let me know. Thx. On August 30, 2011, Melanne Verveer emails Clinton an article titled “Family planning as a pro-life cause,” and tells Clinton “I know you are going off to France for the Libya meeting.” Clinton forwards the message to Sullivan. On August 28, 2011, Clinton aide Lona Valmoro sends Clinton, Abedin and Sullivan a copy of Clinton’s sensitive daily schedule, which is fully redacted. On November 1, 2012, Valmoro sends Clinton, Abedin and Hanley a copy of Clinton’s sensitive schedule that includes a briefing with President Obama and afterward a meeting with then-Special Envoy for Middle East Peace David Hale, Burns and Sullivan. In a September 1, 2011, email marked sensitive Abedin notifies Clinton that United Arab Emirates’ money for the Transitional National Council of Libya is blocked in the U.S. financial system. The assumption was that the money was actually frozen Libyan assets. The UAE claimed it was not Libyan money. The State Department did not provide information about where the emails were found; why they were not previously produced; or if additional records are anticipated. In November 2019, the State Department first disclosed to the court that the FBI had found this latest batch of emails. In a December 2019 court hearing, a Justice Department attorney could not tell a federal court judge how and where the FBI discovered the new cache of Clinton emails. In authorizing additional discovery, including the deposition testimony of Hillary Clinton, in this separate Judicial Watch lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Lamberth specifically referenced the FBI’s recent discovery of Clinton emails: With each passing round of discovery, the Court is left with more questions than answers. What’s more, during the December 19, 2019, status conference, Judicial Watch disclosed that the FBI recently produced approximately thirty previously undisclosed Clinton emails. State failed to fully explain the new emails’ origins when the Court directly questioned where they came from. *** Even though many important questions remain unanswered, the Justice Department inexplicably still takes the position that the Court should close discovery and rule on dispositive motions. The Court is especially troubled by this. To argue that the Court now has enough information to determine whether State conducted an adequate search is preposterous, especially when considering State’s deficient representations regarding the existence of additional Clinton emails. Magically, after years, the FBI finds more Clinton emails that are classified, involve Benghazi, and detail communications with President Obama. This drip, drip game that the DOJ, FBI, and State are playing is a key reason a federal court authorized more discovery, including the sworn deposition of Hillary Clinton.",Fitton: New Clinton Emails Include Benghazi and Classified Information,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/fitton-new-clinton-emails-include-benghazi-and-classified-information/,Breitbart
"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) criticized his Democratic colleagues in the Senate on Monday for delaying the coronavirus relief package, claiming such efforts were “disgraceful.” Cotton, who has been a firm advocate of getting cash into the hands” of American workers displaced by the pandemic, accused Senate Democrats of reneging on legislation to provide immediate economic relief. Democrats, the senator claimed, were holding workers and small businesses hostage in hopes of attaining a more politically favorable deal. Cotton said from the Senate floor: There is a good bill, a bill that was negotiated in good faith . . . that [Democrats] are now blocking, they will not even start debate on [it] because of ideological wish-list items. It is disgraceful and it is dangerous to the lives of our people and their economic well-being. Cotton’s comments came shortly after Democrats blocked a second attempt to move the relief package forward. Negotiated over the week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, the deal, if implemented, would provide every American earning less than $75,000-per-year a $1,200 cash payment to stimulate the economy during the pandemic. The proposal also included a $500 billion grant and funding program for businesses adversely impacted by the virus. On Sunday, the deal looked to be all but finalized, until Pelosi opted to walk away and craft her own stimulus package, claiming the original was too beneficial to large corporations. Many, though, believe the Speaker and her fellow Democrats are politicizing a national crisis. That image was only enhanced on Monday when Pelosi released the draft version of her relief legislation, which included provisions for same-day voter registration, automatic extension of nonimmigrant visas, and mandates for “corporate board diversity,” among others. Cotton, himself, took to social media after his floor speech to highlight some of the more “absurd provisions completely unrelated to the crisis at hand” that were stuffed into the Speaker’s relief bill. 1. Corporate pay statistics by race and race statistics for all corporate boards at companies receiving assistance 2. Bailing out all current debt of postal service 3. Required early voting 4. Required same day voter registration 5. 10k bailout for student loans — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 23, 2020  10. Retirement plans for community newspaper employees 11. $15 minimum wage at companies receiving assistance 12. Permanent paid leave at companies receiving assistance — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 23, 2020  Other Senate Republicans were just as quick to repudiate Pelosi and her counterparts in the Senate for their actions. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) had perhaps the most colorful of rebukes on Monday, when addressing his colleagues from the Senate floor. “Do you know what the American people are thinking right now,” Kennedy said. “They’re thinking that the brain is an amazing organ. It starts working in a mother’s womb, and it doesn’t stop working until you get elected to Congress.”",Tom Cotton Slams Democrats for Delaying Coronavirus Relief: Disgraceful,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/tom-cotton-slams-democrats-for-delaying-coronavirus-relief-disgraceful/,Breitbart
"Monday on MSNBC, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said President Donald Trump’s plan for the country to return to regular business activity soon was motivated by his and Vice President Mike Pence’s stock portfolios. Anchor Ari Melber said, “Any reaction to what we heard out of the press conference here, and specifically Donald Trump already sort of trying to tout the idea that we have a return to normalcy soon?” Gillibrand said, “Well, the president isn’t making any sense. And in fact, we have a major health crisis in front of us. I’ve talked to almost every hospital in New York State, and they’re still worried about getting basic personal protective equipment, getting more masks, getting more gowns, getting more ventilation machines. This is a huge crisis. And for him to downplay it because he’s worried about stock prices or his own economy, it’s shocking. It’s a lack of leadership. And so what Congress is working on right now is how do we support our small businesses, how do we support employees who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, how do we make sure people can have sick leaves and paid leave days, how do we make sure that those who cannot be working because their children are home and the schools are closed, how can they still keep putting food on the table? Everybody has a purpose right now, and our purpose as individuals is to stay at home, to keep our families safe, to make sure we don’t transmit a virus more than it needs to be transmitted. Every time you choose to stay at home and not go look at the cherry blossoms or not go to the beach, you’re making a choice to not transmit this virus and keep more people safe. That is the right choice, and we all have a duty to do that.” She added, “We have people in the senate whose husbands are sick on oxygen right now because of the coronavirus. I’ve talked to the families across New York whose children, whose parents are sick with the coronavirus. This is a real epidemic. For the president, for the vice president to downplay this because of their stock portfolios is shocking and really antithetical to the moment we’re in. That’s why Congress is working hard to try to meet the needs of the American people because the president and his administration certainly aren’t.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","Gillibrand: ‘Shocking’ Trump, Pence Downplayed Coronavirus for Stock Portfolios",2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/23/gillibrand-shocking-trump-pence-downplayed-coronavirus-for-stock-portfolios/,Breitbart
"Attorney General Bill Barr warned hoarders of medical equipment on Monday at the White House that the federal government had the power to seize their goods, thanks to an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. “If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something that you have to worry about, but if you are sitting on a warehouse with surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door,” Barr said at the White House press briefing on Monday. The order granted the Department of the Health and Human Services to designate select medical equipment as scarce, according to Barr, who said that the Department of Justice would be working with them to retrieve the equipment. Barr said that people hoarding medical goods and materials on an industrial scale for the purpose of manipulating the markets would be affected, not businesses obtaining supplies for operation.

"Coronavirus task force leader Dr. Deborah Birx acknowledged at the White House on Monday that the federal government quickly used a “very blunt force” to stop the spread of the virus. “We went out with a very blunt force,” she said, referring to recent tough advice from the Centers for Disease Control guidelines. “We had to do that because we weren’t sure where the virus was and where it was going.” Birx spoke at the White House press briefing and said that the task force learned a lot about the virus and had the necessary data to update their recommendations. “It has to be very tailored geographically and may have to be tailored by age group, understanding who’s at the greatest risk and understanding how to protect them.” President Donald Trump said that doctors would likely prefer a complete global shutdown to prevent the virus from spreading, but he argued that Americans could do two things at the same time. Trump predicted updated “timelines” and “datelines” to loosen restrictions but said that “hotspots” like Washington, New York, and California would retain strict advisories. Birx said that some states were further along than others in trying to “flatten the curve” of medical cases of the virus, and other states were not as affected. “Each state and each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve ,because the seeds came in at different times,” Birx said.

I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person,” Paul said in a statement. “I had, however, traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate.

"Officials in the hardest-hit states in the U.S., like New York, are prepared to impose legal penalties on individuals who flout restrictions implemented to stem the spread of the widening novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. U.S. coronavirus hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Washington State, and California, respectively, are cracking down on public gatherings and shutting down all non-essential businesses, organizations, establishments, and other facilities. Some U.S. states and localities are quickly discovering that well-intentioned, but toothless requests to maintain adequate social distancing might not persuade freedom-loving U.S. residents to comply with never-before-imagined restrictions. In the United States, legal consequences for those who ignore coronavirus rules currently range from nothing to fines and jail time. The federal government has left enforcement of coronavirus restrictions in the hands of states and localities. Some law enforcement agencies in the country have already begun to deal with rule-breakers. In New York, the hardest-hit state (20,875 cases; 157 deaths), Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced a statewide “stay at home” order and banned all non-essential employees from coming to work. “These are not helpful hints … these are legal provisions, they will be enforced,” Cuomo declared, noting that New York will impose civil fines on businesses who fail to comply. In New York City (12,305 cases; 99 deaths), Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that police officers would be enforcing social distancing. Moreover, individuals who break mandatory quarantines in New York can face between $200 and $2,000 per day in fines in NYC alone and up to $2,000 per incident elsewhere, the New York Post reported early this month. “Violations that pose an immediate danger to the public can also result in arrest and prosecution on a misdemeanor charge,” the newspaper noted. NYC Department of Health employees have the “legal authority make arrests, use physical force and conduct searches — although they can’t carry guns unless they’re licensed,” the Post added. In New Jersey (2,844 cases; 27 deaths), now home to the second-highest number of cases, Gov. Phil Murphy announced a “stay at home” order over the weekend. Gov. Murphy has also required the shut down of non-essential businesses and banned public gatherings. “Murphy said law enforcement across New Jersey is prepared to charge people who willfully disregard the rules,” WHYY-TV, a component of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR), reported Saturday. Meanwhile, in Washington State (1,996 cases; 95 deaths), Gov. Inslee has not been specific about consequences for breaking the legally imposed ban on large gatherings, saying he expects widespread compliance. “The penalties are you might be killing your grandfather if you don’t do it,” he said in early March. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Constitution’s Commerce Clause grants the federal government the authority to impose isolation of cases and quarantines. State and local state health officials also have the power to enforce quarantine and isolation, the CDC said. “These laws can vary from state to state and can be specific or broad. In some states, local health authorities implement state law. In most states, breaking a quarantine order is a criminal misdemeanor,” the CDC noted. In 2018, the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice revealed that half of the states have “police powers” to enforce public health restrictions. Gov. Inslee has ordered all bars, entertainment, and recreational facilities across Washington to shut down and has limited restaurant service to take-out or delivery only. In California (1,887 cases; 35 deaths), Gov. Gavin Newsom recently issued an order instructing all residents of the state to “stay at home” in a bid to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. While law enforcement agencies say they want compliance, not arrests, the new measure comes with a misdemeanor penalty for anyone who violates it. Nevertheless, Newsom, echoing the governor of nearby Washington State, said, “I don’t believe the people of California need to be told through law enforcement,” adding that social pressure will push people to stay at home, the Orange County Register reported. “This is not martial law. Nor is it intended to arrest people who leave their home,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva reportedly added in a video, referring to the “stay at home” order that Los Angles County put in place shortly before the statewide one. “It is simply an effort to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This is temporary,” the sheriff added. “There is no need to panic.” Meanwhile, California’s Bay Area has imposed some of the tightest coronavirus restrictions in the nation to keep the disease from surging and overwhelming the health care system. Officials from San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa, and Alameda Counties — ordered residents to abide by “shelter in place” measures that went into effect March 17. For people who have a home in the Bay Area, failure to comply with the “shelter in place” order could result in a “misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment or both,” the New York Times reported. However, San Francisco’s police chief, Bill Scott, noted that officers would be taking a “compassionate, common-sense approach” to enforcement, SFGate pointed out. More than 100 million people are in lockdown in the United States as quarantine-like measures expand across the country. It remains unclear whether officials implemented the restrictions in the United States early enough to be sufficient to stem the spread of the deadly and highly contagious virus.","Penalties for Ignoring Coronavirus Restrictions in U.S. Hotspots Include Jail Time, Fines ",2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/penalties-for-ignoring-coronavirus-restrictions-in-u-s-hotspots-include-jail-time-fines/,Breitbart
"LOS ANGELES, California — Breitbart News visited two recreation centers in Los Angeles on Monday where the homeless are being moved as part of the city’s plan to keep coronavirus from spreading among that population. As Breitbart News reported this weekend, the city plans to move thousands of homeless people into recreation centers in residential neighborhoods. There has been little consultation with local residents, and some homeless people are worried that they may be more likely to contract coronavirus in shelters — a concern shared by some federal officials, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, reporting on similar plans elsewhere in the state. Local residents have not been consulted about the plan — and some are deeply concerned about the possibility of coronavirus spreading from the homeless population to local residents, as well as about the possible loss of their recreational facilities. Breitbart News obtained a letter from leaders in the upscale community of Pacific Palisades, where one recreation center is designated for use as a homeless shelter, to city officials. (The center is located next to a playground that is very popular with local families and is closed due to coronavirus.) Pacific Palisades recreation center (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News) In the letter, they support helping the homeless, but ask pointed questions, adding: “The Palisades community needs assurances that there is a detailed plan, that it’s shared with the community, that it’s safe for all, and that it really is a temporary shelter.” Breitbart News visited a center in Westwood, which is already operational, on Monday. Its doors were closed at 2:00 p.m., and several homeless men were waiting outside to gain entry, some resting in the sunshine. Westwood recreation center (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News) Staff inside the center, who were wearing masks, would not allow Breitbart News to view the interior. Two officers from the Los Angeles Police Department had been assigned to watch the center, and did so from their patrol car. They told Breitbart News that they would not prevent anyone from leaving the center if they wanted to do so. At about 2:00, a shuttle bus pulled up near the entrance, with signs in the windows reading “SHELTER.” Shuttle to shelter (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News) One driver told Breitbart News that the bus drives around the neighborhood, looking for homeless people. It asks them a series of screening questions, and checks their temperatures, then takes them to the facility, where they are assigned a cot. One man, Ray Ortiz, told Breitbart News that he was frustrated at having to wait for the shelter to open. He had been moved from the nearby shelter at the West Los Angeles Armory, and had originally been picked up from the Venice neighborhood, where he had been sleeping on the beach. He claimed to be an electrician by trade, and to have come to L.A. from Arizona “to work, and to surf.” He said he would feel safer from coronavirus in the shelter. Breitbart News also viewed another location, at Cheviot Hills, which is next to outdoor recreation facilities that are still in use by local residents during the “shelter at home” order. Children were among those present nearby. Cheviot Hills recreation center (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News) Inside the building, Breitbart News observed hand sanitizer dispensers, and staff working within a gymnasium that had cots set up inside it. Staff onsite, who work for the City of Los Angeles, would not permit any photographs.
Advocates for the homeless are divided about the use of recreation centers. Some who spoke to Breitbart News suggested it may be a temporary measure, on the way to a more permanent effort to relocate and treat the homeless. Joel B.

"Many American graduates will lose their jobs in the coronavirus meltdown unless they pressure C-suite executives to shrink the million-plus H-1B visa workers on the payrolls, say lawyers, political activists, and Americans who have lost jobs in prior mass layoffs. American graduates “must act now to ensure the huge pending layoffs are imposed on Indian H-1Bs instead of on Americans,” said Marie Larson, a co-founder of the American Workers Coalition.  American and Indian managers have already replaced American graduates with an army of roughly one million Indian white-collar workers, including roughly 750,0000 H-1B workers. Hundreds of thousands of other visa and work-permit workers are imported from China, Europe, and Asia under rules allowing renewable stays one to three years. Many of these visa workers are hidden from media outlets and American employees because they are hired via a network of Indian-run subcontracting firms, such as Tata or Infosys. House Democrats — aided by business lobbyists — have drafted a bill to protect the visa workers, and the Department of Homeland Security took two steps last week to help accelerate the 2020 arrival of 85,000 more H-1B workers. American managers will be reluctant to fire their visa workers, in part, because it is more difficult to rebuild a visa-worker labor force than it is to rehire fired Americans. “There’s plenty of evidence that Indian managers will be reluctant to fire fellow Indians,” said Ron Hira, an expert on the outsourcing industry and an associate professor at Howard University. “There are cultural network effects on hiring — anybody who studies diversity and underrepresented minorities or females knows these things have effects [because] people tend or hire people who they are comfortable with, who are like them,” he said.  “If an H-1B gets laid off, they have to leave the country, and that can be a devastating experience, particularly if they have a house and a family here,” Hira said. “They will be much more desperate to keep their jobs. … Those folks are so desperate they will work for nothing,” he added.  Americans “have to band together,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of USTechworkers.com, adding: That means you have to make a collective decision to go to management and make your demands. You have to band together and meet with your legislators at municipal, country, state and federal levels. You have to do it immediately. You run the risk of getting fired, but the reality is that they are going to fire you anyway. That’s the plan … The time to fight back is now. “You go as high up as you can, to the CEO, the director of human resources,” said James Otto, a California lawyer who has won court cases for Americans who were fired so the companies could import Indian workers.

Companies have to promise that the H-1B will not disadvantage Americans when they first ask the government for permission to import H-1B workers. According to a summary by Cornell University’s law school: An employer seeking to employ H-1B nonimmigrants in specialty occupations … shall state on Form ETA 9035 or 9035E that the employment of H-1B nonimmigrants will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment. The employers’ commitment is made in the “Labor Condition Application” form: The employer shall provide working conditions for nonimmigrants which will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed. The employer’s obligation regarding working conditions shall extend for the duration of the validity period of the certified LCA or the period during which the worker(s) working pursuant to this LCA is employed by the employer, whichever is longer. The rules are tighter for companies that are deemed an “H-1B Dependent” employer: An H-1B dependent or willful violator employer is prohibited from displacing a U.S. worker in its own workforce within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing of the visa petition. “Get organized. Gather evidence … collect documents,” said John Miano, a lawyer at the Immigration Reform Law Institute. “Fifty people bringing a case adds a lot more weight.” The H-1B laws provide little or no protection for Americans graduates, he said. But lawsuits can be based on patterns of executives’  discrimination against Americans in favor of people who are not citizens or not Americans, he said. The lawsuits can also be brought against companies that keep many workers on subcontractors’ payrolls. “It is tougher to prove,” he said, adding, “It ain’t what you know, it is what you can prove.” Americans also need to lobby Congress and get media attention before they are fired, Larson said. “It is a time for action, even if it puts people at risk — putting your heads down, keeping anomalous, it’s not having an impact,” she said.  The Indian H-1B workers are lobbying Congress to preserve their work permits and jobs, so Americans must accept that politics is more important than their technical expertise, she said. “We need every American graduate to push this issue as much as possible. … They need to call, email, and tweet their senators and reps daily.” Indians will shout “Racism!” at American employees who rally their black, white, Latino, Asian, native-born, and immigrant peers into a group to protect their economic rights and their jobs, Larson said. “Whenever anybody shouts the word ‘racism!’ everybody freezes,” she said. But the Indian groups already organize themselves to fight in Congress for jobs, she said:  Immigration Voice is the lobbying group that is heavily lobbying our Congress, including on bringing in more visa workers and the green card giveaway [S.386], has become a master of using “Racism!” as a whip to cow the American people into going with their demands. “The Indians are a group of groups, they look out for themselves,” said Lynn, adding: We see ample evidence of preferential treatment. They look out for people of their nation, their caste, their region, and hence we see case after case of country-of-origin discrimination and preferential hiring for their in-group. Over the last two years, American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption. In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher. Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.   THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020  The racism claims that are routinely thrown at Americans are the reverse of the workplace reality, Larson said. “Yes, there is discrimination, but it is in favor of Indians, and it is done by U.S. executives,” because they prefer to hire and fire cheap, compliant labor from India, she said, adding: Our hard-fought employee rights are being pushed to the curb. The message has been entirely skewed so that visa workers can come in saying “We want diversity,” “Don’t be racist,” but Americans for decades have been fighting for employee rights, rights for women, for minorities, and these are all just being stepped over. … [Americans] are being pushed aside — even Chinese-Americans and Asian-Americans to a great extent. Indians are just dominating [in workplaces] and all these other minorities don’t even have any representation [in workplaces] any longer. It is not diversity at all. The conflict between American employees and visa workers exists because Congress allows companies to hire visa workers who have far fewer rights in the job market than do legal immigrants, he said. “The most important issue is … we should have immigrants and immigration, not guest-worker visas.” “When you are in these desperate times, it is going to create even more negative, knock-on effects on the labor market,” he said.  Govt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc. The Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.

Americans need to document their companies’ staff, collect contacts, performance evaluations, and force executives to explain their decisions, he said.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) plan to fight the coronavirus includes a national mandate for ballot harvesting, same-day voter registration, and federally-mandated early voting provisions just in time for the 2020 presidential election. As part of Pelosi’s coronavirus plan, House Democrats slipped in multiple measures from their H.R. 1 legislation that would implement nationwide ballot harvesting for federal elections — effectively allowing political operatives to collect and deliver an endless number of absentee ballots from voters. Pelosi’s coronavirus plan allows “any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot” to a designated election office or post office and does not limit the number of absentee ballots that any one person can collect. California is the only state in the United States to legalize ballot harvesting, though the practice occurs in other states as well. Pelosi’s coronavirus plan would legalize California-style ballot harvesting in every state for federal elections. Pelosi’s coronavirus plan also mandates nationwide same-day voter registration, where eligible voters are allowed to register to vote on the same day as the 2020 presidential election and every federal election after that. Pelosi would also ban states from requiring voter registration applicants to provide more than the last four digits of their Social Security Numbers when applying to vote. Likewise, Pelosi’s coronavirus plan mandates: Pelosi’s coronavirus plan uses the pandemic to cram provisions of the House Democrats’ H.R. 1 legislation into federal law. That legislation went even further in its efforts to create loopholes for voter fraud, allowing convicted felons to vote in federal elections. House Democrats on Monday blocked the passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which would have provided direct relief to American workers, citizens, and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus crisis.

"Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Monday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) “highjacked” bipartisan negotiations to the detriment of the American public’s health. Pelosi and Schumer decided to nix bipartisan negotiations over the third phase of the congressional coronavirus response package on Sunday. Instead, Pelosi decided to craft her own bill in the House, which would significantly delay the American people’s and businesses’ ability to receive relief in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Senate Democrats blocked for the second time in 24 hours a procedural motion that would allow for the Senate to continue debating and subsequently pass the coronavirus package. Braun told Breitbart News that there was “no doubt” that Democrats were playing with the American people’s lives by delaying crucial aid to the American public. “I think, for the Democrats, it’s been highjacked by Pelosi and Schumer trying to extract more stuff out of it, maybe the far-left side of their party to do it as well,” he added. The Hoosier senator said that he had talked to four or five Democrat senators that believe that they could still come to a bipartisan agreement on a coronavirus package after addressing a few minor issues. Braun explained, “I talked to four or five Democrats today to see what the actual issues that were most important to most of them. And, it was stuff we could all live with, and that was plussing up a bit, not much, for hospitals, for defense against the coronavirus …. state and local governments are going to have issues with employees not showing up, especially in the urban areas. And, then, the last one was the full transparency on the emergency stabilization fund, especially as it would relate to the airline industry, and I was good with that. Everyone from ‘Main Street’ like me wants to make sure when the government starts interfacing with larger businesses, there’s full transparency.” Instead of focusing on these issues during their negotiations with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Braun said that Democrats had moved forward with a “laundry list” of change to the bill that includes “climate issues, employment policy, minimum wage.” Braun’s interview with Breitbart News follows as McConnell said on the Senate floor on Monday that some Democrats are “embarrassed” that Pelosi and Schumer blocked the bipartisan relief package. The Hoosier senator said that he did not “extract” any admission of embarrassment from his Democrat colleagues, “but I could tell since they weren’t defending” Pelosi and Schumer’s actions, that he knew the Democrats understood they were in the wrong.  Braun said that there is “no excuse” for the Senate not to pass this coronavirus package Monday night through unanimous consent. Braun, however, warned, “If we don’t, we have to wait until Wednesday morning and the American public, I think, will be going through the roof in terms of disappointment and anger in terms of what’s going on here.” The Hoosier conservative noted that Republicans needed to force the Democrats to continually vote down the procedural motion to fight back against Pelosi and Schumer’s political stunt. “I think if we didn’t do what we had done, they would be playing even more footsie with it,” Braun said. Braun concluded, noting that Republicans and Democrats can still come together and pass the coronavirus package to help the American people. He said that congressional leaders should “tweak” the three areas of Democrat concern and “take care of the American public.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"A group of Alabama assisted living facility residents, many of whom are United States military veterans, joined together while in quarantine during the deadly coronavirus outbreak to sing, “God Bless America.” Residents at the Baldwin House, an assisted living facility located in Daphne, Alabama, made the best out of what they had while in quarantine by coming together as one. Misty Brown, the Life Enrichment Coordinator for Baldwin House who recorded the performance, said the reason she shared the video to Facebook was to “bring a little light into a dark time.” “The main objective in sharing this was to bring a little light into a dark time and to remind one another that unity is so important right now,” Brown told Breitbart News. Brown explained that one resident at the facility, a veteran, wanted to remind everyone that unity is important and requested to lead the rendition of the famous, patriotic song, which was written in 1918 by Irving Berlin during World War I. Brown said: Our resident, Mr. Nolan Hardwich, went to our executive director, Jayne Carter, and asked if he could lead the others in ‘God Bless America’ to help calm fears about COVID-19 and to help us remember that believing in our nation, our president, and working together would bring us through everything. I was blessed to be there to record it. “Of the 30 residents we have living at our facility, around six of those happen to be war veterans, some of which served in World War II,” Brown added in regards to many of those seen singing along in the video. Many nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the country have been quarantined for the last few weeks after it was revealed that the coronavirus takes a more serious toll on the elderly. President Donald Trump suggested earlier this month that nursing home facilities suspend “all medically unnecessary visits.” Trump said: Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for [the] elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. “In particular, we’re strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits,” Trump added. “In general, older Americans should also avoid non-essential traveling in crowded areas.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.","Watch— Assisted Living Residents, Veterans in Alabama Sing God Bless America in Quarantine",2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/23/watch-assisted-living-residents-veterans-in-alabama-sing-god-bless-america-in-quarantine/,Breitbart
"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s new stimulus bill would mandate nationwide “ballot harvesting,” allowing party operatives to return other people’s ballots to polling places without “any limit” on the number of ballots. “Ballot harvesting” was legalized in California in 2016, and first used in the 2018 midterm elections. It allows anyone to drop off someone else’s mail-in ballot at a polling station. There is no process for vetting or verifying those delivering the ballots — no background checks or identification requirements. Democrats dropped hundreds of thousands of ballots off at polling stations in 2018, helping Democrats as they flipped seven Republican seats. The practice is illegal in most other states, largely because it is susceptible to fraud and intimidation. Republicans were caught flat-footed in 2018; they experimented with the tactic in recent special elections, only to find that their voters adamantly refuse to give their ballots to strangers. Democrats are more open to the practice — often because the “harvester” previously registered the voter, according to Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel. California’s “ballot harvesting” law has yet to be challenged in court. It is one reason that California remains a one-party state, with little prospect for change in the foreseeable future. Pelosi wants to take that system nationwide. Her bill, released Monday afternoon, provides that every state: A) shall permit a voter to designate any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot to the post office, a ballot drop-off location, tribally designated building, or election office so long as the person designated to return the ballot does not receive any form of compensation based on the number of ballots that the person has returned and no individual, group, or organization provides compensation on this basis; and (B) may not put any limit on how many voted and sealed absentee ballots any designated person can return to the post office, a ballot drop off location, tribally designated building, or election office. In other words, paid party operatives can literally truck thousands and thousands of ballots to the polls, provided they earn a salary or fee, and are not paid by the ballot. It is a practice that is known in Third World countries as “ballot stuffing,” and is outlawed in every democracy, no matter how poor — even in countries where the physical and administrative obstacles to voting are far greater than in the world’s most developed economy. And it is Pelosi’s condition for saving the U.S. economy from coronavirus. Joel B.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reportedly snapped at a reporter who asked about his absence from Sunday’s procedural vote on the coronavirus economic relief package, telling the reporter to “stay away,” citing the CDC requirement to maintain a certain distance. Sanders was holding a virtual roundtable discussion on the virus with members of the far-left “Squad” instead on Sunday. CNN’s Annie Grayer, citing reporting from her colleague Ted Barrett, said Sanders accused a reporter — who asked about his absence from Sunday’s vote — of standing too close to him. “Stay away from me. There’s CDC requirement. Please follow it,” Sanders reportedly said. In a second tweet, Garyer quoted Sanders, who did not explain his absence from Sunday’s vote as originally asked. Sanders said: Right now the most important thing that anybody can do, and that the progressive movement can do, is to make sure that working people get the protection that they need. I’m going to use every tool that I have to make sure that that happened.

"The spread of the novel coronavirus in the Northern Hemisphere could subside in the sweltering summer months only to resurface when cooler, dry seasonal weather returns, four independent preliminary studies conducted by research groups in the United States, Australia, and China have predicted. “We should prepare for annual or sporadic outbreaks every few years,” Stephen Kissler, a bio-mathematician at Harvard University and one of the U.S.-based researchers said, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. According to the Journal, the different researcher groups analyzed how temperature and humidity impact the virus (SARS-CoV2) that causes the disease (COVID-19). The scientists found a cluster of the most severe outbreaks in areas of cool, dry seasonal weather. On Monday, the Journal reported: The four studies—which the research teams themselves posted this month on open-access servers to share the data more quickly—suggest that Covid-19, if unchecked by medical controls, could take its place in a calendar of seasonal epidemics that range from malaria, measles and meningitis to tuberculosis and whooping cough. With more data, the effort to link the disease to seasonal weather patterns might eventually help public-health authorities anticipate future outbreaks and marshal timely countermeasures, the U.S.-based scientists said. The Journal acknowledged that the studies are preliminary, given that they rely on data obtained during the first six weeks or so of the accelerating coronavirus outbreak, now considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization. No one has peer-reviewed the studies, the newspaper also said, adding: Public-health experts at the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who weren’t involved in the studies, say it is too soon to draw conclusions about seasonal behavior of the new coronavirus. While many coronaviruses such as those that cause the common cold are seasonal, medical experts say there isn’t enough evidence to conclude that Covid-19 will go away this summer. The outbreak has surfaced in areas with generally high and humid temperatures, including Florida and Latin America. Nevertheless, there have been more cases in temperate regions. While it remains unclear how the different seasons will impact the novel coronavirus, some researchers believe that hot, humid weather may not favor the survival and transmission of the disease. Researchers at Beihang University and Tsinghua University in Beijing in China, the birthplace of the novel coronavirus, found that the disease was more contagious in areas with low temperatures and relative humidity that in warmer and more humid regions. The study funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China reportedly said: High temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of Covid-19. In July, the arrival of summer and rainy season in the Northern Hemisphere can effectively reduce transmission of the Covid-19; however, risks remain in some countries in the Southern Hemisphere [such as] Australia and South Africa. Health analysts at Ausvet, an Australia-based private epidemiology consulting company, reached similar conclusions.",Warning: Coronavirus Outbreaks Could Become a Seasonal Affliction,2020-03-23,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/warning-coronavirus-outbreaks-could-become-a-seasonal-affliction/,Breitbart

"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed the country under effective house arrest Monday evening, the latest development in the country’s fight against coronavirus which has ranged from the simply sclerotic to the outright authoritarian. Speaking to the nation on Monday evening, Boris Johnson ordered the public to stay at home except in a small number of circumstances, including infrequent trips to buy food, visits to the doctors, and essential work travel. The United Kingdom also banned public gatherings of more than two people, and empowered the police to enforce these rules. The British government’s road towards what some critics have described as “putting the country under house arrest” has taken several twists and turns, with the Johnson administration and its expert advisers having taken a comparatively lax approach towards the coronavirus pandemic. The nature of the response started slow, now reaching apparent fever-pitch in shutting down the country in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. UK Coronavirus Lockdown: ‘If You Don’t Follow the Rules, the Police Will Have the Powers to Enforce Them’ https://t.co/aoKxnPOkkI — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2020  As early as January 13th, Public Health England (PHE) confirmed it was “monitoring the situation with international partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO)” in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated — but said that the “risk to the UK population is very low and the risk to travellers to Wuhan is low”, simply advising people in the city to wash their hands and avoid contact with animals in public markets. By Jauary 20th, when the virus was spreading throughout China and cases confirmed in Japan, South Korea, and Thailand, Public Health England still insisted “the risk to the UK population is very low and the risk to travellers to Wuhan is low”, but that the situation was under “constant review”. On January 22nd Public Health England said flights from Wuhan itself would be met by “Port Health team[s] who will… provide advice and support to those that feel unwell” but travel remained unrestricted, with no compulsory self-isolation or other quarantine measures in place — and the risk to the British public was still “assessed as low, based on the emerging evidence”, with the risk t “travellers to Wuhan” raised merely to “moderate”. On January 28th Public Health England claimed that “the risk to the public remains low” but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) began “advising” people against travel the China’s Hubei province, where Wuhan is based, unless they deemed it “essential”. People who had “returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days” were advised to self-isolate for 14 days — but no enforcement action was implemented. By February 7th, long after the United States and several other countries had began restricting travel from China, Public Health England confirmed three infections had been detected in Brtiain and finally raised its assessment of risk to the British public to “moderate” — although they added that the “risk to individuals remains low”. Travel to and from China remained unrestricted. Indeed, travel with newly-emerged epicentres such as South Korea, Iran, and Italy, also remained unrestricted, with flights from the stricken countries continuing to land in Britain down to the present day, with the government claiming there was “no evidence” travel bans would slow the spread of the virus in Britain. It's time, to paraphrase @realDonaldTrump, for a complete shutdown of travel from China until our countries' representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. #coronavirus #wuhan  https://t.co/ebC1T8U42S — Jack Montgomery (@JackBMontgomery) January 28, 2020  As the virus began to take hold, domestic anti-coronavirus measures also remained lax, with members of the public merely advised to wash their hands with soap and water for twenty seconds at a time regularly and Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jenny Harries, filming a short conversation in which they discussed why banning mass gatherings such as football matches and concerts would make little impact on the spread of the disease. In contrast to other governments, which were banning travel and enforcing social distancing and quarantines, the Johnson administration appeared to be pursuing a strategy of so-called “herd immunity” in which the coronavirus would pass through much of the population, until enough people had gained immunity that it could no longer propogate effectively. Much was made of how “herd immunity” among younger, healthier people would shield the elderly and other vulnberable from the virus — although no measures were actually put in place to ensure it would not infect them as well. Then, on March 12th, the Chief Medical Adviser and the Chief Scientific Adviser received evidence from Imperial College London that their initial estimates were wrong, and that the “herd immunity” strategy would result in over a half a million deaths. It had been indicated on several occasions that the best way to deal with the pandemic would be to “flatten the curve” — that is to say, not try to reduce the total of people infected, but to try to ensure they were infected over a long period of time rather than all at once, so the country National Health Service (NHS) and its Intensive Care Units (ICUs) would not find themselves overcapacity and unable to do anything for people who could otherwise have been saved. The Imperial College data revealed the existing strategy was emphatically not flattening the curve, causing the government to shift, belatedly, towards containment. NEW: Here is the government’s full advice on when you are allowed to leave your home during this unprecedented lockdown. #COVIDー19 pic.twitter.com/10fr8SeNcO — Paul Brand (@PaulBrandITV) March 23, 2020  Much of the government’s supposed containment measures remained merely advisory for quite some time. Schools were the first things to actually be closed, except to the children of key workers, followed by hospitality venues such as pubs, cafes, and restaurants, and entertainment and leisure venues such as cinemas, theatres, and gyms — all far later than in neighbouring countries. The government also began advising older Britons to self-isolate, and younger Britons to practise social distancing, not gathering in large groups and remaining a reasonable distance apart. While many presumably followed the advice, a signficant minority did not, with pictures and videos showings parks packed and throngs of people attending public markets and high-capacity mosques — while shops heaved with panic-buyers stripping the shelves of toilet paper, meat, and imperishable goods cheek by jowl. All of this, while countries such as Italy, Spain, and Germany were banning gatherings of more than a handful of people and ordering people to remain indoors except for essential business outside, finally proved too much for the government as the country continued to hurtle towards the same sort of exponential explosion in cases which had crippled hospitals in Lombardy.

He also called for $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as a first step in tackling the global pandemic. “It is time to put armed conflict on lock-down and focus together on the true fight of our lives,” Guterres said. “The virus does not care about nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith. It attacks all, relentlessly.” “Meanwhile, armed conflict rages on around the world,” Guterres said, adding that health networks in “war-ravaged countries” have collapsed and now is the time for talk not hostilities. Today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives – the #COVID19 pandemic.https://t.co/F6JRA6ekvZ pic.twitter.com/7WgtFMk5GC — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 23, 2020  Guterres later used a digital news conference to flesh out his plans for global funds to be sent to the poorest countries on the planet. “The package needs to make households be afloat, make businesses be afloat, keep societies being afloat,” Guterres said. “This will require a double-digit of GDP (gross domestic product) support in the developed world and creating the conditions through the IMF (International Monetary Fund), through the swaps among central banks, through the creation of new facilities,” he said. “We need a much stronger coordination,” said Guterres, adding he had written to the world’s 20 largest economies (G20) and would join their virtual meeting later this week. “Coordination in making sure that not only the developed countries can respond effectively to the disease, but that there is massive support to the developing world not to let the disease spread like wildfire,” he said.

"Labour’s chairman Ian Lavery told activists that coronavirus was a “great opportunity” to organise and advance the party’s political agenda. In a recording obtained by political news website Guido Fawkes, Mr Lavery is heard telling thousands of young Labour activists during an online chat on Friday night: “By the way when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. “But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour Party members, community champions out there a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it gets people together. “We need to make sure that we do that, and community organising — what a great opportunity it’s going to give us.” “Every one of us, every one of our families… relations, friends, organising the communities, because there is going to be lots of people out there that really need our help,” the MP for Wansbeck added.

Shameful.” Criticism also came from Lavery’s own party, with one Labour MP telling The Telegraph: “It looks like the chairman of the Labour Party is distastefully using a pandemic which is killing people as a party political opportunity for Labour, which most people would find repulsive.” Former Labour MP Ian Austin, who left the party over its handling of antisemitism allegations, also called the remarks “shameful”. This is shameful. https://t.co/alY5CswcLi — Ian Austin (@IanAustin1965) March 23, 2020  Despite the audio revealing Lavery calling the deadly virus a “great opportunity” for political activism, the Labour MP claimed that the reporting was “intentionally misleading”. He continued in the defence of his remarks: “I’ve spoken about the opportunity for people to get out there and help their local communities and those in need. Nonsense to suggest otherwise. We all need to do our bit to get through this crisis.” The Guido Twitter account responded to Mr Lavery, saying: “Spin all you like, here’s what you said, readers can judge for themselves.” This would not be the first time a member of the Labour Party exploited the coronavirus crisis for political gain, with leadership contender Lisa Nandy saying that due to the pandemic the Brexit transition period “must” be extended — a pet political project before the virus was ever heard of.

"The President of Slovakia, the Prime of Slovakia, and members of his new right-leaning, anti-graft coalition government donned protective masks and gloves for their swearing-in. Slovakia, which split from the neighbouring Czech Republic, or Czechia, in the 1990s, elected President Zuzana Čaputová, of the left-liberal Progressive Slovakia party, in June 2019. Prime Minister Igor Matovič, of the right-populist Ordinary People (OLaNO) party, meanwhile, entered office only this month, after successful talks to form a four-party coalition government, with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic an urgent priority.

(Photo by VLADIMIR SIMICEK/AFP via Getty Images) There has been some dispute over the utility — or lack thereof — of face masks in fighting the coronavirus, with some suggesting that only high-end N95 respirators with clean filters are of use, with simpler surgical masks only being effective for health workers in a clinical setting, for a limited number of uses. Others, however, have pointed to studies showing that even simple surgical masks achieve “a 3.4 fold (95 per cent CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding”, and that an “80 per cent compliance rate” in wearing masks “essentially eliminated… influenza outbreak[s]”. Some have suggested that ubiquitous mass use in countries Japan, for example, explains the relative lack of Chinese coronavirus in that country, despite relatively crowded urban environments and an older population — although this hypothesis has not yet been proven epidemiologically. Why the high rate of #COVID19 infection in Italy, but not in Japan (similar aging populations and family living structures)? It might come down to % of people wearing masks.https://t.co/WbmC9CqIbZ pic.twitter.com/n5BAsVTe9p — Jeffrey Kleintop (@JeffreyKleintop) March 23, 2020 ","PICTURES: New Slovakian Prime Minister, President Don Masks for Inauguration",2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/24/pictures-new-slovakian-prime-minister-president-don-masks-inauguration/,Breitbart
"Such is the “very large acceleration” in Chinese coronavirus infections in the U.S. it now has the potential of becoming the new global epicentre, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned Tuesday. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva at a press briefing that over the past 24 hours, 85 percent of all new coronavirus cases were from Europe and the United States. Of those, 40 percent were from the United States. Reuters reports Harris was asked whether the United States could become the new epicenter and she said: “We are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the U.S. So it does have that potential. “…They (the United States) have a very large outbreak and an outbreak that is increasing in intensity.” The WHO warning came just hours after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence applauded how the country was coming together, including mentioning the contributions from the business community, to take on coronavirus as it continues to spread and impair the country. <span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> As Breitbart News reported, he cited the extraordinary action of President Donald Trump invoking the Defense Production Act, but also noted efforts from 3M, Facebook and Anheuser-Busch in working with the government in tackling the pandemic.

A new poll released by Monmouth University on Monday indicates 50 percent of Americans across the country believe the president is doing a good job in handling the crisis, compared to 45 percent who do not. When broken down along partisan lines, Trump’s performance was rated significantly better among Republicans (89 percent) and independents (48 percent) than Democrats, only 19 percent of whom thought the president was doing a good job.",WHO Issues Bleak Warning: U.S. Could Potentially Be Next Coronavirus Epicenter,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/24/who-issues-bleak-warning-u-s-could-potentially-be-next-coronavirus-epicenter/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump reiterated a positive assessment of Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday, despite the doctor’s reported tensions with the president during the coronavirus crisis. “He’s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci a lot, just so you understand,” Trump said at the White House press briefing. White House reporters, however, repeatedly questioned President Trump about Fauci’s absence, even though the doctor has never attended every briefing. “He’ll be back up very soon and we’ll be discussing dates and times with him,” Trump said, adding Fauci was “very important to me.” But Fauci’s appearance at the White House press briefings sometimes leads to uncomfortable moments, as the establishment media reporters repeatedly ask the doctor to fact check the president’s statements in real-time. Partisan Democrats and establishment journalists have hoisted Fauci, an establishment medical doctor and a political creature of Washington, as a standard-bearer of “science” and “facts” to Trump’s unbridled optimism about beating the virus. Fauci has noted the tension in the briefing room but has repeatedly explained that as a doctor, he will have a different tone than the president. “I think there’s this issue of trying to separate the two of us. There isn’t fundamentally a difference there,” Fauci said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. Fauci demonstrates daily that praise goes far in Washington, DC, especially when the political stakes are high. In an interview with the Atlantic, Fauci said Trump “has a very unique style” but added the president as “always ultimately listened to what I’ve said.” Trump has reciprocated that praise. “Where is Anthony?” Trump asked last week during a briefing, noting the doctor had “become a major television star for all the right reasons.” “He’s just so professional,” Trump added. “So good.” On Tuesday morning, Trump shared a clip of Fauci praising him on a show with Mark Levin. “Thank you Tony!” he wrote. Thank you Tony! https://t.co/U5XxzeQzXJ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2020  But the New York Times reported aides believe the president’s patience with the doctor is waning. Fauci also recently made several statements that demonstrated his disagreements with Trump and flaunted what he believes to be an unimpeachable reputation. In his interview with the Atlantic, Fauci warned the Trump administration would be “foolish” to try and silence him during the crisis. “I don’t think they’re going to try to silence me. I think that would be foolish on their part. And I don’t even think they want to,” he said. “I think, in some respects, they welcome my voice out there telling the truth. I’m going to keep doing it.” Fauci also spoke somewhat candidly with writer Jon Cohen of Science Magazine, noting defensively he could not actively stop the president from making misinformed statements during a press conference. “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” he said, noting that his response was to “try and get it corrected for the next time” the president was on camera. Fauci also said he would never describe the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term that the president has pointedly used on occasion. Fauci told Cohen that he disagreed with the president on occasions but praised him for listening. “[T]o [Trump’s] credit, even though we disagree on some things, he listens,” he said. “He goes his own way. He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.” But the two might find their tensions irreconcilable, should Fauci publicly push back against Trump’s desire to loosen restrictions on Americans after the 15-day period to “stop the spread” and “flatten the curve” — terms Fauci has recommended and supported. When asked by reporters on Monday if Fauci agreed with him about loosening restrictions, Trump replied, “He doesn’t not agree with me.” The president said he respected Fauci’s advice but that he would consult more than just one doctor about the future of the country. “He’s very important to me,” Trump said about Fauci. “I will be listening to him. I’ll be listening to [Dr.] Deborah [Birx], I’ll be listening to other experts. We have lot of people that are very good at this and ultimately, it’s a balancing act.”",Donald Trump Maintains Working Relationship with Dr. Anthony Fauci Despite Tensions ,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/donald-trump-maintains-working-relationship-with-dr-anthony-fauci-despite-tensions/,Breitbart
"Michael Gove has warned Britons that unless they abide by government rules to self-isolate during the coronavirus outbreak, then the “people you love most may die”. On Monday night, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a nationwide lockdown after people were widely reported to have ignored the government’s recommendations to practise social distancing in order to slow the spread of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. Under strict new rules, gatherings of two or more people who do not live together have been banned. People may only leave their home once a day to exercise, buy groceries or medicines, or travel to work only if necessary. Only shops selling essentials must be open. The measures will be in place for at least three weeks and police have the power to enforce self-isolation if necessary. However, widespread reporting on Tuesday revealed people still flouting the public health regulations, with London trains seen packed with commuters. Speaking on Sky News on Tuesday morning, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove gave a stark warning to people who continue to ignore isolation rules: “Unless you stay at home, then the people you love most may die.” Mr Gove continued: “Unless people take appropriate steps now, then the NHS will be under more strain. If the NHS is under more strain, then those that we love, those that we care for most, are at risk of losing their lives.” “All of us will have someone in our lives who we know may be vulnerable because of age or other factors. We love them. We want them to stay safe. The best way of keeping them safe is to stay at home, to limit your time outside to one piece of exercise every day, or that minimum shopping,” he added. The Road to Lockdown: How Britain Went From Coronavirus Light-Touch to National House-Arrest https://t.co/rN0LyST9h2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 24, 2020  The minister also addressed reports of people from cities flooding into the country and coastal towns, causing concern amongst communities and their MPs of the virus establishing itself in new locations. “Stay at home,” Mr Gove said. “They should not be at risk of spreading the virus across the country and nor should they risk putting a strain on the NHS in other parts of the country. The advice is clear: stay at home,” he said. Despite some not following the rules, a snap poll by YouGov revealed that the overwhelming majority of people, 93 per cent, were in support of the lockdown. Two-thirds of Britons (66 per cent) said they would be able to cope with going out only for food and exercise for the next three weeks. Police will have the power to disperse groups or fine those who ignore the rules. Of those surveyed, Britons were split (39 per cent/39 per cent, 22 per cent “don’t know”) on whether those responses will be sufficient to enforce the lockdown. As of Monday, there have been 336 deaths in the UK — a rise of 55 on the day before. The UK is approximately two weeks behind Italy, which is the viral epicentre for Europe and has seen more than 6,000 deaths. ‘Too Late’: Farage Criticises Open Borders While Britons Locked Down in Coronavirus Crisis https://t.co/M2By5p6V6F — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2020 ",Minister: ‘People You Love May Die’ Unless You Stay Home,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/24/minister-people-you-love-may-die-stay-home-during-coronavirus/,Breitbart

I would wish that would stop because we have a much bigger problem here than trying to point out differences. They really, fundamentally, at the core when you look at it, there are not differences. The president has listened to what I’ve said with the other people on the task force have said. When I’ve made recommendations, he’s taken them. He’s never countered and overridden me.

"The media rushed to blame President Donald Trump on Monday for the death of an Arizona man who ingested a form of chloroquine — before it turned out that the man had ingested a fish tank cleaner with a similar chemical. Reuters reported: An Arizona man has died and his wife is in critical condition after they ingested chloroquine phosphate – an aquarium cleaning product similar to drugs that have been named by President Trump as potential treatments for coronavirus infection. The couple, in their 60s, experienced immediate distress after swallowing the drug, an additive used at aquariums to clean fish tanks, according to Banner Health Hospital in Phoenix. Chloroquine phosphate shares the same active ingredient as malaria drugs that President Trump has touted as possibly effective against COVID-19, the potentially life-threatening disease caused by the coronavirus. Many media outlets, however, reported that the man died after taking “chloroquine.” Axios, for example, had to delete a tweet and issue a correction after reporting, initially: “Man dies after self-medicating with chloroquine.” We have deleted this tweet and corrected our story because it did not reflect the full nature of the self-medication done with an additive commonly used to clean fish tanks. https://t.co/0zucqRaIkI pic.twitter.com/3YY86rju2w — Axios (@axios) March 24, 2020  The website added an “editor’s note” to the story: “Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that the form of chloroquine the couple ingested was used in aquariums — and it was not a medication.” BuzzFeed reported: “A Man Died After Self-Medicating With A Drug Trump Promoted As A Potential Treatment For The Coronavirus.” The text described “a drug meant for aquariums” without distinguishing between a product sold for fish tanks and a product for humans prepared by a pharmacist and supplied with a medical prescription. President Trump has spoken specifically about the medically-supervised use of chloroquine — specifically, a drug called hydroxychloroquine, often used in combination with azithromycin, which has shown anecdotal efficacy in treating coronavirus victims, though it has not yet been proven to do so in clinical trials. On Monday, he praised New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for launching clinical trials of the experimental medication regimen. Trump spoke specifically about “the hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak,” the latter another name for azithromycin. Last week, NBC News’ Peter Alexander accused Trump of giving Americans “false hope” by touting the potential of the drug. The false claims about Trump encouraging a man to ingest fish tank cleaner are in the same vein. After Trump supporters noticed the errors in reporting about the man’s death, the phrase “FISH TANK CLEANER” began trending nationwide on Twitter late Monday night. Joel B.

"President Donald Trump criticized Congressional Democrats on Tuesday for using the coronavirus rescue package to push for environmental priorities. “This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!” The president has tried to signal his traditional dealmaking persona regarding the package but criticized Democrats for pushing solar and wind tax credits and carbon reduction and alternative fuel mandates for the airlines. Trump also criticized Pelosi and House Democrats on Monday night for blowing up a deal with the Senate. “The Democrats want the Virus to win?” he asked on Twitter. “They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders and Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn’t agree!” Earlier in the evening, Trump appeared optimistic a deal could be reached. “They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics, and I think that’s happening,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House, adding, “It’s not really a choice. They don’t have a choice. They have to make a deal.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continues to negotiate with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on a massive rescue package. Despite Schumer’s insistence Democrats would reach a deal on Monday, Mnuchin left Capitol Hill without a deal. Both parties signaled optimism, however, that a $2.5 trillion rescue plan deal could be reached by Tuesday. In the meantime, Republicans expressed outrage that Democrats were not moving quickly enough to get a deal passed. “This has got to stop and today is the day it has to stop,” an exasperated McConnell said on the Senate floor on Monday after Democrats blocked legislation from advancing. “The country is out of time.” This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) plan to fight the coronavirus includes giving millions in American taxpayer funding to refugees living overseas. Pelosi, along with House Democrats, blocked passage of a coronavirus relief package for American workers, citizens, and small businesses in favor of their own plan that increases taxpayer funding to foreign refugees. Included in Pelosi’s plan is a designation of $300 million in American taxpayer money to foreign refugees:   (Text of House Democrats’ coronavirus plan) In comparison, for example, Pelosi’s plan only gives about $100 million in additional funds for runaways and homeless youth in the U.S. and only an extra $15 million to the “Veterans Employment and Training” office to help respond to the health crisis. Taxpayer money for foreign refugees is also about $100 million more than what Pelosi’s plan specifically designates for the emergency food and shelter program under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.

"Gun sales in New Jersey came to a screeching halt Saturday after New Jersey State Police Superintendent Patrick J. Callahan announced a shutdown of the state’s background check system. The end of the state’s background check system followed on the heel’s of Governor Phil Murphy’s (D) order closing all “non-essential businesses” in the Garden State. Murphy did not include gun and ammunition stores as essential, therefore their doors had to close on March 21 at 9 p.m. like all other “non-essential” establishments. The New Jersey State Police responded to Murphy’s order by announcing they would close the state’s background check system as part of the non-essential shutdown. The NRA-ILA posted the New Jersey State Police announcement: On Saturday March 21, 2020, Governor Phil Murphy announced he is putting New Jersey in lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus. Per Executive Order 107, he is ordering the residents of New Jersey to stay home, directing all non-essential retail businesses closed to the public. At this time, the order includes New Jersey Firearms State Licensed Dealers. The New Jersey State Police NICS Unit is directing the vendor of the NICS Online Application (NICUSA) to turn off the NICS Online Services for submitting NICS transactions by eliminating the “Request Form” button, effective 9:00pm EST, Saturday, March 21, 2020. You will still have the ability to view the message board and the status of previously submitted transactions. This “Request Form” feature will remain off until further order by Governor Murphy. In a state where it is mandated that all gun sales be conducted via a background check, the shutdown of the system shuts down gun sales. If you already have a firearm and ammunition for self-defense you are one of the lucky ones. The NRA-ILA responded to the background check closure by saying, “New Jersey’s actions are an unacceptable deprivation of Second Amendment rights at a time when residents are concerned for the safety of themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"In reaction Tuesday to Democrats attempting to add extra, unnecessary items into the coronavirus relief package, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) slammed Democratic leadership for including their “ideological wish list.” Cornyn called the attempt by Democrats to leverage their wishes into the needed bill “shameful,” adding the political games being played over the bill are “reckless and irresponsible.” “Everybody knows this is a national emergency, but this is like shooting the tires out in the fire truck that’s going to put out the fire,” Cornyn told “Fox & Friends.” “These are people who are getting paid to show up for work, and there are many people through no fault of their own aren’t getting paid anything, and we need to get money to them to help bridge them through this crisis.” He added, “This is all about leverage. Unfortunately, the American people don’t have time to wait on these games to get the help they need, nor do the hospitals or the businesses that are shut down through no fault of their own. We need to make sure that when we get out of this health care crisis that there are jobs there for the American people so the economy can start booming again and so people can provide for their families. But unfortunately, they’re having to wait because of this idea of leverage.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said on the Senate floor on Monday that the Democrats are putting American lives at risk by delaying emergency legislation to address the coronavirus outbreak’s toll on Americans and the U.S. economy. “As of this morning worldwide, there have been 16,381 deaths, so that’s — I’m sorry,” Cruz said. “That’s the number now. This morning, it was only 15,308.” “That means today, while the Democrats have been blocking this bill, 1,073 additional people died,” Cruz said. “In the United States, as of this morning, there were 471 deaths reported due to coronavirus. As of right now, it’s 573.” “That means today, 102 Americans died while the Democrats were blocking consideration of this bill,” Cruz said. “In Texas, as of this morning, there have been eight deaths,” Cruz said. “Now there are nine.”  “One Texan died while half this chamber refused to show up and do their job,” Cruz said. “There is a time for political disagreements,” Cruz said. “There is a time for policy disagreements.” “I am no stranger to robust political and policy disagreements,” Cruz said. “But we are in the midst of a global pandemic.” “People are dying,” Cruz said. “People are suffering.” “It is not a time to play games,” Cruz said. “It is time to stand for the men and women.” “It is time to stand for jobs,” Cruz said. “It is time to help protect people’s lives.” On Monday, Democrats blocked for the second time in 24 hours a bill that would have provided immediate economic relief to American workers and businesses. The Senate blocked a motion to cloture to advance the coronavirus package for debate. The motion failed, with 49 senators in favor of the motion and 46 against the measure.

"In a Tuesday interview on CNN’s “New Day,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) sounded off on the coronavirus relief package as senators draft the bill to provide an economic stimulus. Manchin said the bill should be announced on Tuesday, but questioned whether or not the money will “magically jump” the economy while Americans are generally stuck at home “scared.” “We know we have to help all the industries stay afloat,” Manchin told host Alisyn Camerota. “Right now, the frontline is the virus itself. You can’t throw enough money at this, Alisyn, and basically think the economy is just going to magically jump back when people are basically sheltering in place, not leaving, they’re scared. We want to make sure that we have treatment, we want to make sure that we a vaccine that works, all these things, and the health care is stable enough that we can be there to protect it. That’s what we have do.” Manchin said the checks should be made available “hopefully” by the first of next month. “We already have a system in place to get checks, waive the waiting period of one week or so, let’s get it moving. And basically, what we’re doing is doubling up and trying to help them recover as quickly as we can to have money in their pockets to be able do something,” Manchin outlined. “That’s where the crux of the money from the Democrats was going to the workers.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Manchin on Coronavirus Stimulus: You Can’t Throw Money at This and Think the Economy Is Going to Magically Jump Back,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/24/manchin-on-coronavirus-stimulus-you-cant-throw-money-at-this-and-think-the-economy-is-going-to-magically-jump-back/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump reiterated a positive assessment of Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday, despite the doctor’s reported tensions with the president during the coronavirus crisis. “He’s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci a lot, just so you understand,” Trump said at the White House press briefing. White House reporters, however, repeatedly questioned President Trump about Fauci’s absence, even though the doctor has never attended every briefing. “He’ll be back up very soon and we’ll be discussing dates and times with him,” Trump said, adding Fauci was “very important to me.” But Fauci’s appearance at the White House press briefings sometimes leads to uncomfortable moments, as the establishment media reporters repeatedly ask the doctor to fact check the president’s statements in real-time. Partisan Democrats and establishment journalists have hoisted Fauci, an establishment medical doctor and a political creature of Washington, as a standard-bearer of “science” and “facts” to Trump’s unbridled optimism about beating the virus. Fauci has noted the tension in the briefing room but has repeatedly explained that as a doctor, he will have a different tone than the president. “I think there’s this issue of trying to separate the two of us. There isn’t fundamentally a difference there,” Fauci said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. On Tuesday, Fauci said in an interview with Washington, DC talk radio WMAL that the media was “not helpful” by trying to pit him against Trump. “The president has listened to what I have said and what the other people on the task force have said. When I have made recommendations he has taken them,” he said. “The idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful.” He added, “That is really unfortunate. I would wish that that would stop.” Fauci demonstrates daily that praise goes far in Washington, DC, especially when the political stakes are high. In an interview with the Atlantic, Fauci said Trump “has a very unique style” but added the president as “always ultimately listened to what I’ve said.” Trump has reciprocated that praise. “Where is Anthony?” Trump asked last week during a briefing, noting the doctor had “become a major television star for all the right reasons.” “He’s just so professional,” Trump added. “So good.” On Tuesday morning, Trump shared a clip of Fauci praising him on a show with Mark Levin. “Thank you Tony!” he wrote. Thank you Tony! https://t.co/U5XxzeQzXJ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2020  But the New York Times reported aides believe the president’s patience with the doctor is waning. Fauci also recently made several statements that demonstrated his disagreements with Trump and flaunted what he believes to be an unimpeachable reputation. In his interview with the Atlantic, Fauci warned the Trump administration would be “foolish” to try and silence him during the crisis. “I don’t think they’re going to try to silence me. I think that would be foolish on their part. And I don’t even think they want to,” he said. “I think, in some respects, they welcome my voice out there telling the truth. I’m going to keep doing it.” Fauci also spoke somewhat candidly with writer Jon Cohen of Science Magazine, noting defensively he could not actively stop the president from making misinformed statements during a press conference. “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” he said, noting that his response was to “try and get it corrected for the next time” the president was on camera. Fauci also said he would never describe the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term that the president has pointedly used on occasion. Fauci told Cohen that he disagreed with the president on occasions but praised him for listening. “[T]o [Trump’s] credit, even though we disagree on some things, he listens,” he said. “He goes his own way. He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.” But the two might find their tensions irreconcilable, should Fauci publicly push back against Trump’s desire to loosen restrictions on Americans after the 15-day period to “stop the spread” and “flatten the curve” — terms Fauci has recommended and supported. When asked by reporters on Monday if Fauci agreed with him about loosening restrictions, Trump replied, “He doesn’t not agree with me.” The president said he respected Fauci’s advice but that he would consult more than just one doctor about the future of the country. “He’s very important to me,” Trump said about Fauci. “I will be listening to him. I’ll be listening to [Dr.] Deborah [Birx], I’ll be listening to other experts. We have lot of people that are very good at this and ultimately, it’s a balancing act.”",Donald Trump Maintains Working Relationship with Dr. Anthony Fauci Despite Tensions ,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/donald-trump-maintains-working-relationship-with-dr-anthony-fauci-despite-tensions/,Breitbart
"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) torpedoed a bipartisan deal Sunday on a lifeline for the U.S. economy. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who had previously praised the negotiations, followed her lead. Pelosi then introduced her alternative — a pork-laden Democrat wish list of unrelated items from the “Green New Deal” and other radical policies. Aside from Pelosi and Schumer, here is a list of the other politicians blocking the relief. (Note that this does not include those with ordinary objections — worthy or not — to the bill, based on concerns that it is too generous to corporations, or that it does not provide enough money for hospitals, et cetera. Those are largely rationalizations and talking points, but they are to be expected in the rough-and-tumble of political debate.) This list focuses on those whose reasons appear linked to special interests, pure partisanship, or incompetence. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA): The co-sponsor of the “Green New Deal” told Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC on Monday that he opposed the bill precisely he backs the special interest provisions that Pelosi wants to put into it: “We want to make sure that it has workers’ protections in it … if they want to give the money to oil companies, gas companies, coal companies, but not to wind and solar companies, we should know that right up front,” he said. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA): Schiff actually defended Pelosi adding completely irrelevant, radical changes to voting, like nationwide “ballot harvesting,” telling Chris Hayes of MSNBC: “I think what they’re really focused on is, we want to make sure that we protect not only the health of the economy, but the health of our democracy, and for that reason, we wanted to make sure that we provide that people can vote by mail, and have early voting.” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL): On Monday, Durbin defended Pelosi’s intervention in the negotiations, flying in from San Francisco at the last minute to disrupt a deal in the Senate. Durbin said: “She is the Speaker of the House, you know. And the measure, whatever we do here, is headed over there for consideration. The fact that she would want to be party to that negotiation is not an outrageous idea.” He did not explain why she needed her own new bill. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT): When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Murphy why Democrats were demanding “solar panel tax credits and collective bargaining rights” in Pelosi’s new legislation, he pleaded ignorance. “I don’t know where those reports come from,” he said. But GOP Senators spent much of the debate on Monday listing all of the giveaways in Pelosi’s proposal; the “reports” were coming from the Senate floor, about a bill from his own party. Joel B.

"The National Rifle Association (NRA) notes that coronavirus shutdowns resulting in the closure of gun stores in various states demonstrate that gun controls the left once pushed as “reasonable” have become anything but. The Democrats’ pet gun controls — waiting periods, universal background checks, etc. — are pushed again and again as common sense, “reasonable” solutions to keep guns out of the wrong hands. When the NRA and other gun rights groups push back, citing the opportunity for tyranny, they are shamed with accusations of being pawns of the gun industry. But coronavirus shutdowns at the state level have cast a light on just how unreasonable waiting periods and universal background checks can be. For example, on March 19, 2020, Breitbart News reported on the lines that stretched from inside to outside of certain California gun stores, lines of customers wanting to buy a gun for self-defense. The line was so long that some customers abandoned the effort. But for those who stuck it out, they made it all the way to the counter to learn that they could buy a gun but could not take possession of it until a ten-day waiting period had passed, per California law. On March 24, 2020, Breitbart News reported that New Jersey State Police followed Gov. Phil Murphy’s (D) shutdown order by announcing that that state’s firearm background check system would be shut down. In a state with universal background checks, shutting down the background check system means zero gun sales, period. In other words, if you do not have a gun for self-defense prior to the shutdown you will not have a gun for self-defense afterward (unless you are one of the few people who got their name in the system prior to the shutdown). Ironically, all the “reasonable” gun controls now contribute to a scenario where law-abiding citizens cannot acquire firearms for self-defense.     In a dangerous world, the Second Amendment is often all we have.

"A newly filed lawsuit in federal court alleges Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) may have committed securities fraud by selling upwards of $1.72 million in stock before the coronavirus pandemic reached its height in February. Politico reported on Tuesday a shareholder of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts is suing the senator in federal court, alleging Burr used inside information available to him as a member of congress to avoid widespread losses on the stock. “Senator Burr owed a duty to Congress, the United States government, and citizens … not to use material nonpublic information that he learned by virtue of his duties as a United States Senator in connection with the sale or purchase of any security,” the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, reads. The lawsuit comes as Burr is facing calls to resign amid revelations he unloaded thousands of dollars worth of stock—less than a week before the stock market sharply dropped because of the coronavirus pandemic. The senator’s timely sell-off netted between $628,000 and $1.72 million. Most of the shares were in hospitality companies, like Wyndham Hotels and Hilton, that took an especially hard hit as coronavirus travel restrictions went into place. More troubling is that the transactions, 33 in total, came as the Intelligence Committee, which Burr chairs, was receiving daily briefings on the pandemic. Given that fact, when news of the sell-off broke, speculation began to stir that the senator had acted on inside information to protect his assets. If true, Burr could potentially be found in violation of the STOCK Act, which prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit by lawmakers. Burr has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. In a statement issued last week, the senator admitted while the selloff was motivated by the coronavirus, he did not act on information privileged only to members of congress. “I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13,” Burr said, urging the Senate Ethics Committee to launch an investigation into the sale.",Lawsuit Accuses Burr of Securities Fraud over Coronavirus Stock Dump,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/lawsuit-accuses-burr-of-securities-fraud-over-coronavirus-stock-dump/,Breitbart

"Gun sales in New Jersey came to a screeching halt Saturday after New Jersey State Police Superintendent Patrick J. Callahan announced a shutdown of the state’s background check system. The end of the state’s background check system followed on the heel’s of Gov. Phil Murphy’s (D) order closing all “non-essential businesses” in the Garden State. Murphy did not include gun and ammunition stores as essential, therefore their doors had to close on March 21 at 9 p.m. like all other “non-essential” establishments. New Jersey State Police responded to Murphy’s order by announcing they would close the state’s background check system as part of the non-essential shutdown. The National Rifle Association, Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) posted the New Jersey State Police announcement: On Saturday March 21, 2020, Governor Phil Murphy announced he is putting New Jersey in lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus. Per Executive Order 107, he is ordering the residents of New Jersey to stay home, directing all non-essential retail businesses closed to the public. At this time, the order includes New Jersey Firearms State Licensed Dealers. The New Jersey State Police NICS Unit is directing the vendor of the NICS Online Application (NICUSA) to turn off the NICS Online Services for submitting NICS transactions by eliminating the “Request Form” button, effective 9:00pm EST, Saturday, March 21, 2020. You will still have the ability to view the message board and the status of previously submitted transactions. This “Request Form” feature will remain off until further order by Governor Murphy. In a state where it is mandated that all gun sales be conducted via a background check, the shutdown of the system shuts down gun sales. If you already have a firearm and ammunition for self-defense you are one of the lucky ones. The NRA-ILA responded to the background check closure by saying, “New Jersey’s actions are an unacceptable deprivation of Second Amendment rights at a time when residents are concerned for the safety of themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host and network legal analyst Sunny Hostin accused President Donald Trump of caring about his personal finances more than the lives of Americans by planing for the country to return to regular business activity soon amid the coronavirus pandemic. Co-host Sara Haines said, “I don’t think there’s a scenario right now where people should be returning to work. We had a problem with messaging early on, and we saw that specifically, Fox News had to dial back for a lot of their viewers what they thought and then were corrected and had to redirect course. Messaging was a big problem, which is maybe why we are low on tests, and we are low on supplies. We didn’t take it seriously soon enough. Now we are taking it seriously, and it’s important that that message stays consistent for right now. We know there are going to be economic pitfalls, but those can be dealt with after we make sure we’re clear of this virus. So right now, the only thing we can do is social distance. Again, I know there are some things that are affecting politicians and governments. No government is designed to shut down. I get all of that. But if we don’t stay true to this course right now, we’re going to have a slow bleed that lasts and numbers that have not been seen globally yet.” Hostin said, “This is America. We can save our grandparents if we just stay at home. That is not too much to ask for. And every single health expert is advising this president to continue to tell people to stay at home. For him to just sort of flout that advice tells me that there is something in it for him. It tells me that there’s something economic in it for him. When you look at trump’s personal businesses, you know that he is losing almost $500,000 a day because six out of his seven hotels are losing money. They are shuttered every day, and that is why our Founding Fathers put the Emoluments Clause into the Constitution because our president should be more concerned about the lives of Americans rather than lining his own pockets, and I think that’s what this is really about.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",ABC’s Hostin: Trump More Concerned with Lining His Own Pockets Than Lives of Americans,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/24/abcs-hostin-trump-more-concerned-with-lining-his-own-pockets-than-lives-of-americans/,Breitbart
"The province (département) of Aisne in northeast France has banned the sale of alcohol for the duration of the coronavirus lockdown. The prefect of Aisne, Ziad Khoury, announced Tuesday that alcohol is no longer to be sold, citing ties between alcohol and violence. “Excessive consumption of alcohol is likely to create increased disturbances and violence, especially within the family,” he said. Local media have described the new regulation as “politically awkward,” suggesting that confining people to their homes without the comfort of a glass of wine borders on cruel and unusual. The decree “will ruin all confidence in the representatives of the State who seem to use their power for personal moral ends more than for the general interest,” writes Fabrice Bluszez in Paris Dépêches. Authorities had already closed down bars, restaurants, and cafés, but as of Tuesday even those shops such as supermarkets allowed to open are now obliged to close by 8:00pm. The Aisne prefecture sent a copy of the decree to supermarkets on Tuesday morning, mandating that all shut down their alcohol sections. For the moment, the alcohol ban will last until March 31, but France’s political leaders have already said that the lockdown will almost certainly be extended. So far, Aisne has seen 22 deaths related to positive tests of COVID-19.

"President Donald Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday that he wanted to get the economy reopened by Easter. “I’d love to have it open by Easter,” Trump said, setting a date for reopening the country for the first time. Easter is on April 12. “I would love to have the country opened up and rearing to go by Easter,” he repeated. “That would be a great American resurrection,” Fox News moderator Bill Hemer replied. The president has promised to listen to his doctors and advisers on loosening restrictions set by the government to fight the coronavirus pandemic, but has said would ultimately make the final decision. Trump appeared upbeat during the event, pleased that the stock market rose over 1,600 points on Tuesday. He said he looked forward to the day that Americans could go to work, noting that a massive economic depression had its own death toll. “We can socially distance ourselves and go to work, and you’ll have to work a little bit harder,” Trump said. “You can clean your hands five times as more as you used to, you don’t have to shake hands anymore with people.” Trump said again that he wanted the economy reopened in weeks, not months. He said that putting restrictions on Americans was “one of the most difficult decisions that he ever made.” “You’re basically turning off the country,” he said, adding that, “I wasn’t happy about it, and I also knew I had to do it.” Trump said that the economic shutdown was “painful” and “destabilizing” but that it would soon be time for Americans to return to their lives. “We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought, and people can go back to work and they can also practice good judgment,” he said. Dr. Deborah Birx said during the town hall that she would continue looking at the data, and urged Americans to continue following the restrictions set by the Centers for Disease Control.",Donald Trump on Reopening Economy: ‘I’d Love to Have it Open by Easter’,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/donald-trump-on-reopening-economy-id-love-to-have-it-open-by-easter/,Breitbart
"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has no immediate plans to cancel the Democrat convention this summer, DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa confirmed on Monday. The DNC has no immediate plans to suspend or cancel the July 13–16 gathering at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the United States. “There are no plans to cancel the convention and we are not considering a rules change at this time,” Hinojosa said, according to Politico. “Contingency planning is a routine part of preparations for any convention.” Her statement followed reports of the DNC crafting backup plans in the event of the pandemic extending all the way into the summer. According to a source cited by the New York Times, DNC organizers have been engaged in “intensive scenario-planning”: Among the complicating factors are the uncertain nature of the professional basketball season — the arena hosting the convention is home to the Milwaukee Bucks, a top N.B.A. team likely to play deep into the playoffs if the league’s season were to restart — and how the party’s delegates will be selected. Delegates in most states are elected to the national convention from state conventions, but many state conventions, scheduled for late spring and early summer, are also being postponed. Democrats are also forced to face the fact that, while the numbers are in favor of Joe Biden (D), they do not yet have a nominee. Several states are postponing their primary elections, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has yet to bow out of the race, which adds to the mounting uncertainty. Convention spokeswoman Katie Peters acknowledged the unprecedented challenge of the coronavirus and the impact it could have on the convention but did not say that the DNC is changing plans — at least not yet. “As we navigate the unprecedented challenge of responding to the coronavirus, we’re exploring a range of contingency options to ensure we can deliver a successful convention without unnecessary risk to public health,” Peters said, according to the New York Times. “This is a very fluid situation — and the convention is still more than three months away. We are committed to sharing updates with the public in the coming weeks and months as our plans continue to take shape,” she added. As Politico notes, the DNC has a host of potential options “if a traditional convention is not possible, including postponing the gathering or changing the rules to allow delegates to vote remotely.”",DNC Has No Plans to Cancel Democrat Convention as Coronavirus Response Continues,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/dnc-has-no-plans-to-cancel-democrat-convention-as-coronavirus-response-continues/,Breitbart
"President Barack Obama’s immigration enforcement director is urging President Donald Trump to release thousands of migrants from detention facilities into the U.S. jobs market amid an economic meltdown. “Preventing the [China] virus from being introduced into these facilities is impossible,” according to a March 22 article in the Atlantic by  John Sandweg, Obama’s former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE is fortunate that the threat [to migrants’ health] posed by these detention centers can be mitigated rather easily. By releasing from custody the thousands of detainees who pose no threat to public safety and do not constitute an unmanageable flight risk, ICE can reduce the overcrowding of its detention centers, and thus make them safer, while also putting fewer people at risk. ICE has 37,000 people caught in detention, and “only a small percentage” should be kept in detention, he suggested. “In fact, only a small percentage of those in ICE detention have been convicted of a violent crime. Many have never even been charged with a criminal offense. ICE can quickly reduce the detained population without endangering our communities,” he wrote. His Atlantic op-ed ignores the economic impact of releasing 30,000 migrants into Americans’ blue-collar job market, where they can join hundreds of thousands who flooded in during 2019. That huge labor supply reduces blue collar wages and drives up housing costs in blue collar neighborhoods. His push to release more blue collar migrants comes as House Democrats try to extend the work-permits used by hundreds of thousands of white collar visa workers. Sandweg framed his catch and release policy as a health and crime issue, saying: This doesn’t mean that dangerous criminals will be walking the streets. Those who threaten Americans’ safety can and must continue to be detained. … When an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs in an ICE facility, the detainees won’t be the only ones at risk. An outbreak will expose the hundreds of ICE agents and officers, medical personnel, contract workers, and others who work in these facilities to the virus. Once exposed, many of them will unknowingly take the virus home to their family and community. Many promigration activists and groups are using the coronavirus disease to push for a mass release, regardless of the impact on Americans. Also, the California-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the release of a migrant on March 23 because of the claimed threat posed by the coronavirus. The published order allows judges in the circuit’s lower courts to order the release of other migrants. The Ninth Circuit – of its own accord! – just ordered the release of a detained immigrant, citing ""the rapidly escalating public health crisis,"" which ""will particularly impact immigration detention.""  More courts should follow suit. Now. (Thank you for sharing, @aaronlittman!) pic.twitter.com/VoaxktwQgv — Charanya Krishnaswami (@charanya_k) March 23, 2020  But ICE has already taken many measures to reduce the real risk of the Chinese disease spreading through the confined detention centers. For example, it has reduced the danger by scaling back arrest of non-violent migrants into the 30-plus detention centers. It has temporarily halted asylum hearings for the 30,000 migrants waiting in Mexico under the”Migrant Protection Protocols” rule. The agencies are also deporting new border crossers back to Mexico — and flying others back to their distant homelands — without putting them in the ICE detention centers.

Court officials also require visitors and lawyers to wear protective gear. Sandweg worked as the ICE chief and top legal advisor to Obama’s Department of Homeland Security. In the agency, he helped to implement Obama’s 2012 amnesty — dubbed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy — which printed 800,000 work permits for illegals during the extended post-2008 recession. He is a law graduate who now works at Nixon Peabody, an elite law and advocacy firm with offices in Washington D.C. and many other cities. The huge 2019 inflow was largely allowed by legal rules established by progressives under Obama, and it ended in early 2020 when Trump and his populists blocked the catch and release of economic migrants into the U.S. labor market. The migration ended once the would-be migrants realized they could not get U.S. jobs they needed to repay their smuggling debts to the cartel-affiliated coyotes. In January, Trump’s deputies released only about 2,000 migrants into the United States, down from 80,000 in May 2019. 10M+ illegals are mixed in with 315M Americans.

"Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), in a Tuesday appearance on Breitbart News Daily, said Democrats are “taking a wrecking ball to Main Street America” by pushing Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) relief package filled with “liberal wish list” items unrelated to the crisis at hand and demanded Democrats to throw her bill in the trash and provide relief to Americans “today.” Scalise, who describes himself as an “eternal optimist,” is hopeful the Senate can get back on track after Pelosi hijacked their bipartisan relief bill with a liberal “wish list” of her own. “This has to end today,” the lawmaker told Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief and Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow. “Roll up your sleeves. Throw away your wish list of far-left or far-right ideology. We put that on the side. This has got to be put on the side. Throw this bill in the trash that Pelosi filed and get back to work for the American people that are literally facing losing everything if this game goes on longer.” Long-term policy discussions, he said, should be saved for the upcoming November elections. “Today is the day. It has to come back together today,” Scalise said. “They have to stop playing the games because, the goodwill is still there, but it’s not going to last much longer.”  Scalise expressed disappointment in Democrats who turned their backs on the bipartisan measure designed to provide immediate relief to the American people and placed the blame squarely on Pelosi for blowing up the bipartisan “lifeline” Republicans and Democrats were working on. Pelosi “flew into D.C. on Sunday and, lo and behold, Sunday is when everything fell apart. And everybody just kind of got this new bill dropped on them in the dark of night after tremendous bipartisan work,” Scalise said, blasting it as a “fantasyland wish list of the far-left socialist left.” “You literally have free benefits to people here illegally, and you’ve got all of these different massive slush funds … that have nothing to do with this crisis. You’ve got a bailout to the Postal Service. What does that have to do with coronavirus?” Scalise asked. “This has got to stop.” “People are about to lose everything they’ve worked for their entire life,” he continued, noting that, on all the calls he has had with Americans who are losing their jobs and small businesses that are on the edge, “not one time has climate studies or carbon-neutral airplanes come up.” “With every day that Nancy Pelosi and her allies play this dangerous game of chicken with our economy, Alex, they are taking a wrecking ball to Main Street America,” he said. “We don’t have days to wait and play this game.” The original bipartisan bill, Scalise said, offered realistic relief to Americans worried about their businesses and individuals concerned by their inability to pay their upcoming bills. “In the bill that we are — at least that we were working on in a bipartisan way — there’s the ability for the big regulators to give relief to our local banks so that they can, for example, give forbearance,” he explained. “So they can tell you if you’re maybe laid off of your job you don’t have to pay your home note for the next 90 days and you don’t have to face losing your home. That was in the bill. That was Republicans and Democrats that put that together.” He also highlighted forgivable loans, which he described as “a loan that will actually be forgiven if they use that money to pay the rent and to make payroll.” “That’s something Republicans and Democrats agreed on that’s in the bill. That’s not what Pelosi’s bill is about. Pelosi’s bill is about same-day voter registration and, you know, these workforce and empowerment studies and solar-paneled airplanes. What are they talking about? What world are they living in?” he asked. Scalise, again, stressed the need for relief for families, as well as for small and medium-sized businesses, touting “loan forgiveness” and “breathing room” for banks, both of which are outlined in the bipartisan bill. “It gives banks breathing room to say you don’t have to make your loan payments for the next few weeks or months,” Scalise explained, highlighting individual relief, via direct $1,200 payments to adults and $500 per child. “That’s all in the bipartisan bill,” the lawmaker said.",Steve Scalise: Throw Pelosi’s Proposal in the Trash; Relief Bill Must Happen ‘Today’,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/steve-scalise-throw-pelosis-proposal-in-the-trash-relief-bill-must-happen-today/,Breitbart
"Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) lambasted his Democrat colleagues on Capitol Hill for thwarting the passage of a coronavirus relief bill. Scott argued Democrats were using the crisis to pass liberal policies, showing that they “don’t care” about the public. “They don’t care,” Scott said. “This is why they should never, the Democrats should never, ever be in charge of anything, because they don’t care about the American public. They care about their liberal agenda, and they’re going to do everything they can do, they’re going to do exactly what Rahm Emanuel said. They’re not going to let a crisis go to waste. And they’re going to try to, you know, put on Americans a whole bunch of their liberal policies.” The Florida Republican discussed how some small businesses had lost everything and, once again, pointed to Democrats’ efforts to add liberal agenda items. “[T]he stories that I’m hearing from small businesses, you know, that they had six restaurants, they were building great businesses, and they just went to nothing. I talked, I mean, there’s so many stories of these little companies, and these people are distraught. And so, and I mean, your heart just goes out to them, because when you have no money, I mean, you’ve got kids, golly, it’s a tough life for these people right now. And then you watch the Democrats.

"Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden touched his face repeatedly while talking about the coronavirus outbreak. The former Vice President was on for three segments of the show and made several gaffs while discussing the outbreak. Co-host Whoopi Goldberg introduced Biden by saying, “It’s looking more and more like our next guest will be the candidate who I am counting on to send you-know-who packing.”
From his home, Biden said, “Well, what I’m doing is they set up a little bit of a studio here in my home. I’m able to speak to you and doing a lot of remote stuff with the media, number one, but I have a full day I’m working on. For example, I start the morning off with an hour and a half briefing with my medical experts on the health circumstances. They send me all these graphs and layout exactly what the status of things are. And then I have an hour and a half meeting with my economic team, former members of the administration and others who are laying out what they think is about to happen and how we should be dealing with it. I spend time on the phone with our congressional leaders, and then I’m doing a fair number of — there’s no show like yours but doing — doing some shows.” When asked about the cure being worse than the virus, Biden said, “We have to take care of the cure. That will make the problem worse no matter what. No matter what. We know what has to be done. We know you have to — you’re tired of hearing the phrase, you got to flatten that curve where it’s going up like this, people getting it, and then it comes down. We got to flatten that curve, and we got to make sure that once, in fact, we have this under control, it doesn’t come back.” In a confusing moment, the vice president said, “I have a map here I want to show you. You can’t see it. A map here from the docs that sent it to me.” As he rubbed his face, Biden said, “Well look, what I referenced before was back, I think, on March 6 or whatever the date was he said a few things that just weren’t accurate, and I think it’s important people get the facts. The American people can handle the truth, but what they can’t handle is something that’s not true that they believe in a moment, and then they found out it’s not true. They lose confidence.” A video compiled by Caleb Hull shows Biden repeatedly touching his eyes and face.

"Community leaders are demanding answers from city officials as Los Angeles continues to implement a plan to move homeless people indoors into recreation centers in residential areas during the coronavirus outbreak. Breitbart News reported Monday that some centers have already opened, and the city is providing shuttles to move homeless people indoors, apparently in an effort to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus in informal encampments, and to provide more “social distancing” in existing shelters. In a letter dated Mar. 21 obtained by Breitbart News and written by the Pacific Palisades Community Council to local officials — including City Councilmember Mike Bonin; Department of Recreation and Parks General Manager Mike Shull; and L.A. Unified School District Board Member Nick Melvoin — leaders from the community suggest that the plan has not been adequately explained. “The decision to quickly house and provide services for homeless people in a grave public health crisis is reasonable and necessary for public health and safety. We support such prudent action,” the letter begins.
However, the community council raises a list of questions: The letter concludes: “The Palisades community needs assurances that there is a detailed plan, that it’s shared with the community, that it’s safe for all, and that it really is a temporary shelter.” There are currently eight confirmed cases of coronavirus in Pacific Palisades, according to Los Angles County. Breitbart News has learned that a popular local recreation center near a playground (above) is reportedly to be used as one of the temporary homeless shelters, with a capacity of 158 beds, placed six feet apart. Police will be assigned to watch the center, but will not force people to stay there. The center is near the commercial center of the community. An email from Mayor Eric Garcetti to city employees on Monday, obtained by Breitbart News, confirms that city employees are being asked to staff the shelters. “As we face this unprecedented crisis of COVID-19, we need you to answer the call and uphold your duty to give back to our communities in new roles and take on unfamiliar tasks — from helping our homeless neighbors to lending a hand to seniors and other high-risk Angelenos,” Garcetti wrote. Breitbart News observed city employees working at a shelter in Cheviot Hills on Monday. As Breitbart News and other news sources have reported, while some homeless people feel safer inside the new shelters, others have expressed reservations, and some do not want to move — especially as they would have to leave most of their belongings behind. One source who works with the city on homeless issues told Breitbart News: “Everybody’s doing it, everybody’s walking through the motions, but I do think there’s some rethinking going on.” There is also the fear that homeless people might be more prone to coronavirus indoors. An essay published by Dr. Richard Hobday on Medium earlier this month argues that the lesson of the influenza pandemic of the early 20th century is that patients do best when treated outdoors, in the presence of sunshine and fresh air. Some have suggested erecting tents or building temporary shelters on unused public property, such as parking lots near the beach that are often empty outside the summer season. Joel B.

"More than 50 pro-life leaders have sent a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar that urges all public health officials to halt the promotion of abortion as the nation responds to the coronavirus crisis. The letter reads that many Americans are “rising to the challenge” of doing all they can to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that originated in China. “Unfortunately, there is one clear outlier – the abortion industry, including the largest abortion chain in the nation, Planned Parenthood,” the national pro-life leaders state, adding: In acts of manifest fearmongering and self-interest, they are exploiting the anxiety of women and couples by continuing to promote abortion in communities across the country. Planned Parenthood is responsible for nearly 346,000 abortions in the last reporting year, including both surgical and medical procedures carried out in many locations all the way to 24 weeks of pregnancy. By ceasing both surgical and chemical abortions now, Planned Parenthood will free up much needed medical equipment and decrease the demand placed on ER’s due to complications from both medical and surgical abortion. This will protect women who will, without doubt, need follow-up care, including infection treatment and transfusions, from the nation’s emergency care centers and hospitals. “Abortion centers are churning out surgical and chemical abortions and putting women, especially the poor, at risk,” the leaders assert. “Their continued operation depletes sorely needed personal protective equipment [PPE] and leads to complications that will further overwhelm already overextended emergency rooms.” The pro-life leaders urge Azar to note that the abortion industry “is compounding one crisis with another”: Therefore, we urge public officials to use their broad emergency authority to safeguard against the extreme abortion agenda by: During the coronavirus crisis, however, Planned Parenthood has refused to stop abortions, even when ordered to do so. Abortion is essential for people’s health and wellbeing. That’s why clinic  doors are staying open. https://t.co/lv55KmompW — NARAL (@NARAL) March 22, 2020  In August 2017, the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, demonstrated the extent of taxpayer-funded Planned Parenthood’s business prowess in promoting its primary money-making service – abortion. CLI released a paper that showed Planned Parenthood obtains 35 percent of the U.S. abortion market, a percentage that well overtakes the market shares of leaders in other industries. “In 2015, Planned Parenthood performed more than one third (35.4%) of all the induced abortions in the U.S.,” wrote Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) President Chuck Donovan and Dr. James Studnicki, CLI’s vice president and director of Data Analytics. The authors compare Planned Parenthood’s share of the U.S. abortion market to the market shares of leaders of other industries:  “The level of market dominance for abortions demonstrated by Planned Parenthood could be taught in business schools as the ultimate example of strategic planning and execution,” Donovan and Studnicki asserted. “It is a defining activity.” Additionally, the authors found that Planned Parenthood depends primarily on its abortion-centered business model – and is not a significant provider of medical care in the United States, despite its self-promotion as an “irreplaceable” and “life-saving” healthcare provider. The report observed that Planned Parenthood provides less than 1.4 percent of the nation’s HIV tests and less than 1 percent of pap tests, and that, within the five-year period prior to the release of the paper, the abortion chain’s service-to-client ratios for breast exams and pap tests had declined by 37 percent. In its most recent annual report, Planned Parenthood revealed its organization performed a record high number of abortions while it also received record high taxpayer funding during the same period. In year 2018-2019, Planned Parenthood performed 345,672 abortions, an increase of nearly 13,000 more abortions and four percent over the 332,757 the group performed during year 2017-2018. Also in 2018-2019, the abortion business was on the receiving end of $616.8 million in American taxpayer funds, a 9.4 percent jump from the $563.8 million it received in year 2017-2018. Yet, Democrat leaders have continued to push for more funding for Planned Parenthood as they hold up federal assistance to Americans and small businesses during the crisis.",Poor Women ‘At Risk’: Pro-Life Leaders Urge Halt to Promotion of Abortion During Coronavirus Crisis,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/poor-women-at-risk-pro-life-leaders-urge-halt-to-promotion-of-abortion-during-coronavirus-crisis/,Breitbart
"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo shared similar views as President Donald Trump on Tuesday, agreeing it would be possible to restart the economy by loosening coronavirus isolation restrictions on Americans. On Monday evening, President Trump made a similar argument at a White House press briefing, stating it was possible to restart the economy and remain conscious of America’s health. “What I’m saying, basically, is that we can do two things simultaneously,” Trump said, noting “we’ve had this incredible learning period” about the virus that might allow the federal government to review the requirements for social distancing. Cuomo made the same argument at a press conference on Tuesday. “Don’t make us choose between the two,” Cuomo said. “We can do both and we must do both.” Cuomo argued lower-risk and younger people could return to work, as soon they would not need to be quarantined with the elderly. Cuomo parroting @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/3REJPJp41q — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 24, 2020  “You can have an economic start-up strategy that is consistent with a public health strategy,” Cuomo said. He said testing recovering individuals from the coronavirus and sending them back to work was essential, noting many Americans likely had the virus and recovered. “I believe once we get that test, you’re going to find hundreds of thousands of people who have had the coronavirus and resolved,” Cuomo said. Cuomo looked forward to younger people returning to work. “Let the younger people go back to work, let the recovered people go back to work,” he said. “Ramp up the economy with those individuals.” Cuomo said that although the initial public health strategy was strict, it was possible to refine recommendations based on what officials had learned about the virus. “So you’re refining your public health strategy and at the same time you’re restarting your economy,” Cuomo said. “Those two can be consistent if done intelligently.”  ",Andrew Cuomo Supports Loosening Restrictions to Restart Economy,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/andrew-cuomo-supports-loosening-restrictions-to-restart-economy/,Breitbart

"Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden had a confusing answer when asked about the coronavirus outbreak. Biden responded, “We have to take care of the cure. That will make the problem worse, no matter what. No matter what. We know what has to be done. We know you have to— you’re tired of hearing the phrase, you got to flatten that curve where it’s going up like this, people getting it, and then it comes down. We got to flatten that curve, and we got to make sure that once, in fact, we have this under control, it doesn’t come back. So we should be focusing on getting all the help necessary in terms of testing, in terms of access to the gear that our first responders, our doctors, our nurses need in treating people.” He added, “We should be getting extra beds, hospital beds in the major cities around the country, in the rule areas. I have a map here. You can’t see it. A map here from the docs that sent it to me. There’s a number of areas in the middle of the country and up north where, in fact, there are no ICU units.

"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is ordering travelers flocking to the Sunshine State from coronavirus hotspots — particularly the New York Tri-State Area — to self-quarantine, he announced on Monday. DeSantis, who is facing mounting pressure to “shut down” Florida and issue a statewide stay-at-home order, announced on Monday that he is cracking down on travelers who are fleeing from the pandemic, particularly from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. “There’s over 190 direct flights from the New York City area to the state of Florida, and I would reckon given the outbreak there, that every single flight has somebody on it who is positive for COVID-19,” DeSantis said on Monday. “And so as we are working to stop it in the state of Florida, you’re consistently having people come in from one of the top hot spots in the entire world,” he continued. “We don’t have people coming from Wuhan, we don’t have people coming from Milan, yet you have a flood of people still coming from New York City,” he explained. The order states: I hereby direct all persons whose point of departure originates from outside the State of Florida in an area with substantial community spread, to include the New York Tri-State Area (Connecticut, New Jersey and New York), and entering the State of Florida through airports to isolate or quarantine for a period of 14 days from the time of entry into the State of Florida or the duration of the person’s presence in the State of Florida, whichever is shorter. This Order shall not apply to persons employed by the airlines and those performing military, emergency or health response. This Order shall take effect on March 24, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. All persons isolating or quarantining under this Section, shall be responsible for all costs associated with that person’s isolation or quarantine, including transportation, lodging, food, medical care and any other expenses to sustain the person during the period of isolation or quarantine. Notably, DeSantis stressed that it is “actually a criminal offense if you violate the quarantine order.” Per the order: Any person who violates any isolation or quarantine directed by the Department of Health commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, which is punishable by imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, a fine not to exceed $500, or both. See § 381.00315(6), Fla. Stat. The order comes as DeSantis faces increased pressure to issue a stay-at-home order for the state of Florida. “It’s not clear to me that doing a massive shut down of an entire state would even work,” DeSantis said. “In New York City, it’s like the party never ended. You got people congregating all over the place.” “You see images from California in Orange County … the beaches may have never been so crowded. These are people who have been ordered to shelter in place and they are not complying with those orders,” he added. DeSantis said that localities may implement more aggressive measures as he has laid the groundwork for the state’s response in accordance with the CDC. However,  taking statewide action on travelers from New York, particularly — a virus hotspot — is one way DeSantis believes Florida can stop the spread. “That’s the only way that we can be sure that that virus is not going to be reintroduced to the state of Florida and then spread,” DeSantis said. “You have so many people working so hard. Many people have sacrificed to try to protect our friends and neighbors … it would be unacceptable to continue to allow it just simply coming in from people who are fleeing a shelter in place order in those states,” he added.",Florida Gov.

"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) defended the alternative bill proposed Monday by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), as Senate Democrats blocked an emergency relief bill to save the economy from the coronavirus. The Senate had been working on bipartisan negotiations through Sunday evening, when Pelosi jetted in from San Francisco and insisted that Democrats walk away from the legislation in favor of her bill, which she released later. As Breitbart News reported, the Pelosi bill includes pork for special interests on the left — and radical changes to voting across the country, including nationwide same-day registration, mail-in voting, and “ballot harvesting.” Chris Hayes of MSNBC felt compelled to ask Schiff about it on his program Monday night: I wanted to raise a critique that has been offered by a lot of folks in the Republican Party, and conservatives observing this today, which is that they say the Democrats are essentially trying to smuggle in a whole bunch of sort of preexisting ideological points — extension of the solar tax credit, changing to the funding mechanism of the post office, which is, the funding mechanism is messed up in lots of ways — but they say you guys sort of see this opportunity to get a bunch of stuff you wanted anyway, in under the cover of emergency legislation. What’s your response to that? Schiff answered: Well, look, I think what they’re really focused on is we want to make sure that we protect [not] only the health of the economy but the health of our democracy, and for that reason, we want to make sure that we provide that people can vote by mail, and have early voting. We saw the fiasco in Ohio, we don’t want that repeated. And I think hat Donald Trump would like, what [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch Mcconnell would like, is a situation where they can create a corporate slush fund that they can do with as they choose, and the voters won’t be able to hold him accountable, they won’t be able to get to the ballot places without risking their lives. And so, we view the economic health and the health of our democracy as very much interrelated. They view the health of their slush fund, and suppressing the vote, as interrelated, and I think that’s part of the conflict. Schiff was one of only several Democrats attempting to defend Pelosi’s bill against nationwide criticism. Joel B.

"A CBS News/YouGov poll released Tuesday shows a majority of Americans polled approve of President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The poll showed that 53 percent thought Trump was doing a good job, versus 47 percent who thought Trump was doing a bad job. The poll surveyed 2,190 U.S. residents between March 21-23, with a margin of error of +/-2.3 points. Specifically, 28 percent thought he was doing a “very good” job and 25 percent said “somewhat good,” while 15 percent said “somewhat bad,” and 32 percent said “very bad.” The results show 22 percent of Democrats believe Trump is doing a good job, 54 percent of independents, and 91 percent of Republicans. Meanwhile, 47 percent of Democrats believe Trump is doing a bad job, 47 percent of independents, and nine percent of Republicans. The poll also showed the majority of Americans are optimistic about the Trump administration’s ability to handle the outbreak, at 54 percent, compared to 46 percent who are pessimistic.

"Tuesday on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) discussed the coronavirus relief package as Congress weighs completion of the legislation. After blocking the bill’s passage over the weekend to include what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called a “wish list” for the Democrats, Pelosi told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that Republicans better not include what they know to be “poison pills” in the newest bill. “I’m optimistic,” Pelosi stated. “I think everybody knows the overarching view is we have to get this done, A. B, I have three options. We can come to a conclusion and it sticks, not that they’re with you on that and they change it. They can come to an agreement, you know, where there is all compromise, A. B, and then we have unanimous consent, and this can move quickly. If we don’t have unanimous consent, my two options with my members is to call them back to vote to amend this bill or to pass our own bill and then go to conference with that.” She continued, “The easiest way to do it is for us to put aside some of our concerns for another day and get this done. But you can support a bill because — if it doesn’t do enough that you want to do, but that’s what you can get — but if it has poison pills in it, and they know certain things are poison pills, then they don’t want unanimous consent.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) revealed Tuesday that the state is experimenting with having two coronavirus-stricken patients share a single medical ventilator to make up for a shortage of machines. “We’re going so far as to try an experimental procedure where we split the ventilator. We use one ventilator for two patients,” Cuomo said during his daily press briefing on his state’s efforts to combat the spread of the deadly disease. “It’s experimental, but at this point, we have no alternative.” Cuomo explained the ventilators are being placed between two patients’ beds with two sets of tubes going to each person. “Necessity is the mother of invention,” the governor added. “We are working on this as we speak because life is options and we don’t have any other options.” Cuomo says New York is experimenting with having two patients share one ventilator: ""At this point, we have no alternative"" https://t.co/hmODbKuv4b pic.twitter.com/8hUOyzJEFH — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 24, 2020  The announcement comes as New York races to transform Manhattan’s Javits Convention Center into complex to treat the coronavirus. The center will add about 2,000 beds to New York’s 53,000-bed hospital system. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will construct four 250-bed temporary hospitals and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will build a fifth facility with an additional 1,000 beds. New York has nearly 21,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and 157 people in the state have died after becoming ill. The virus is projected to lead to a demand for 110,000 hospital beds. “For us, a major thrust is increasing hospital capacity,” Cuomo said. “We’re trying to reduce the rate of the spread of the virus. But at the same time, we have to get that hospital capacity up.” Cuomo said construction on the facilities is expected to be completed in about seven to 10 days at which point they can begin admitting patients. The hospitals, which will serve to take on patients from the state’s traditional hospitals as they are overwhelmed, will also come with medical supplies and be run by 320 federal staffers. “This will be a backfill facility, where we can relieve some of the pressure and the tension from hospitals by using these beds,” he said.

"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) torpedoed a bipartisan deal Sunday on a lifeline for the U.S. economy. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who had previously praised the negotiations, followed her lead. Pelosi then introduced her alternative — a pork-laden Democrat wish list of unrelated items from the “Green New Deal” and other radical policies. Aside from Pelosi and Schumer, here is a list of the other politicians blocking the relief. (Note that this does not include those with ordinary objections — worthy or not — to the bill, based on concerns that it is too generous to corporations, or that it does not provide enough money for hospitals, et cetera. Those are largely rationalizations and talking points, but they are to be expected in the rough-and-tumble of political debate.) This list focuses on those whose reasons appear linked to special interests, pure partisanship, or incompetence. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA): The co-sponsor of the “Green New Deal” told Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC on Monday that he opposed the bill precisely he backs the special interest provisions that Pelosi wants to put into it: “We want to make sure that it has workers’ protections in it … if they want to give the money to oil companies, gas companies, coal companies, but not to wind and solar companies, we should know that right up front,” he said. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA): Schiff actually defended Pelosi adding completely irrelevant, radical changes to voting, like nationwide “ballot harvesting,” telling Chris Hayes of MSNBC: “I think what they’re really focused on is, we want to make sure that we protect not only the health of the economy, but the health of our democracy, and for that reason, we wanted to make sure that we provide that people can vote by mail, and have early voting.” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL): On Monday, Durbin defended Pelosi’s intervention in the negotiations, flying in from San Francisco at the last minute to disrupt a deal in the Senate. Durbin said: “She is the Speaker of the House, you know. And the measure, whatever we do here, is headed over there for consideration. The fact that she would want to be party to that negotiation is not an outrageous idea.” He did not explain why she needed her own new bill. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT): When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Murphy why Democrats were demanding “solar panel tax credits and collective bargaining rights” in Pelosi’s new legislation, he pleaded ignorance. “I don’t know where those reports come from,” he said. But GOP Senators spent much of the debate on Monday listing all of the giveaways in Pelosi’s proposal; the “reports” were coming from the Senate floor, about a bill from his own party. Joel B.

"Every pandemic has a silver lining. In this one, we have finally determined without any doubt that regular White House press briefings no longer serve any useful purpose and should never be resumed. The current gathered press is entirely unworthy of them. The Fourth Estate has become a useless appendage on the republic. A useless appendage filled with self-serving, cancerous pus. “Enemy of the People,” you might call them. While generously patting themselves on the back, navel-gazers in the national political media today often talk about how they are on the “front row of history” and how they are charged with “writing the first draft of history.” They are — if nothing — modest. The truth is that many of them are so steeped in their own stupidity and so deeply hidebound by their own prejudices that they cannot be relied upon to accurately report the time of day. They are so enthralled by the scent of power that they could not even reliably report if it is day or night. During President Obama’s administration, they swooned like damsels in love. Under President Trump, they get vapors, hyperventilate and keel over like a herd of fainting goats. They are incensed that the White House has scrapped the daily press briefings where self-styled “reporters” gather in the James Brady Briefing Room and pepper the White House spokesman with hostile questions. To varying degrees, the White House spokesman would respond by giving answers of varying degrees of veracity. It is utterly inexplicable that any actual reporter could be anything less than thrilled to have — instead of useless daily White House briefings — the actual president of the United States standing in for his spokesman to deliver the news unfiltered. Why not just cut out the middle man? These daily jousting sessions between President Trump and the press expose just how far out of their depth these “reporters” are when confronted with the actual president, rather than some lower-level designate. Covering the White House or Congress or presidential campaigns is not the “front row of history” or writing the “first draft of history.” Actually, it is a responsibility. A responsibility to ask smart, tough questions on behalf of the millions of Americans who do not get that opportunity yet have the responsibility to be informed so that they can make good decisions during elections. Yet, this is what the American citizen gets from the preening White House press corps: “At least one White House official used the term ‘Kung flu,’ referring to the fact that this virus started in China,” a reporter asked President Trump as the American economy collapsed in the face of a global pandemic. “Is that acceptable? Is it wrong?” she pressed. “Kung flu?” The greatest republic on earth is brought to her knees, a third of American market wealth is wiped out and all this reporter wants to do is register how offended she is by what somebody supposedly called the pandemic. It quickly turned out, of course, that the reporter had no idea who used the term “Kung flu.” Nor could she even establish that this mystery “official” had actually even used the term. But, whatever. The president succeeded in making her repeat the term “Kung flu” twice more on national television. Talk about insensitive! Needless to say, when President Trump lashes back at the constant goading and the endless trivializing of serious situations, the press goes bonkers. Recently, a reporter demanded to know if Mr. Trump was peddling a “false sense of hope” — a truly delicious irony given the crack den of freebasing “hope” that the Washington press corps became under President Obama. Mr. Trump responded thusly: “I say you’re a terrible reporter.” So much for falsity or unfounded hope. The press reaction to Mr. Trump’s retort was even more unhinged than it was over his response to the “Kung flu” question. Nothing gets the White House press’ knickers in a bunch like protecting their own honor. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com or @charleshurt on Twitter.","The Nuclear Option: Coronavirus Press Briefings Prove, Once Again, Our Media Are Useless",2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/24/the-nuclear-option-coronavirus-press-briefings-prove-once-again-our-media-are-useless/,Breitbart
"Fox News’s Tucker Carlson says Democrats are seeking a bailout for foreign visa workers in the United States during “the most profound employment crisis of our lifetime” because of the Chinese coronavirus. During a segment on Monday evening, Carlson detailed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) coronavirus plan, which included automatic renewals of visas and work permits for foreign workers taking U.S. jobs in the American economy. “The House version of the bill includes special provisions, for real, to protect foreign nationals working here in the U.S.,” Carlson said. “So we’re staring down the barrel of the most profound employment crisis of our lifetime, that’s not an exaggeration, and what are Democrats doing? They’re trying to automatically renew visas and work permits for all immigrants here in the U.S. because their jobs are very important, way more important than yours.” “Democrats want to make sure that the people replacing you are secure and happy. The whole thing defies belief and that’s not a partisan observation, again, read it,” Carlson said. Carlson was referring to the provisions of Pelosi’s coronavirus plan, which allow several hundred thousand foreign workers — many from China and India — to get college jobs or blue-collar jobs while millions of Americans lose their careers. Breitbart News’s Neil Munro reported: The bill would even allow H-1B visa workers to stay long past the six-term limit on their temporary stays. For example, the foreign workers who are expected to go home in the next 12 months will instead be allowed to “automatically extend such status or work authorization for the same time period as the alien’s prior status or work authorization.” For H-1Bs, the “same time period” is three years. [Emphasis added] The bill would keep several hundred thousand white-collar visa workers and several hundred thousand blue-collar work-permit workers in the U.S. labor market, even as unemployment is expected to spike past 20 percent. [Emphasis added] The bill would also provide a massive giveaway to the many technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies that have replaced a huge number of U.S. graduates with large blocs of compliant Indian and Chinese graduates. [Emphasis added] While the U.S. faces mass unemployment as American workers are forced to stay home from their jobs and small businesses are crushed economically, Fox News’s Laura Ingraham has called for a temporary halt on all immigration to the U.S. “All immigration to the US should be halted due to this national emergency — we sure as heck don’t need any foreign workers with millions of Americans on verge of losing their jobs,” Ingraham wrote, along with “#AmericaFirst.” “All foreign worker visas must be stopped,” Ingraham wrote. As Breitbart News has reported, immigration moratoriums are not uncommon in American history. Currently, there are about 45 million foreign-born residents living in the U.S., a 108-year record high. The country’s last immigration boom — between 1900 and 1920 — was eventually met with a near immigration moratorium. Between 1925 and 1966, the U.S. legal immigration level did not exceed 327,000 annual admissions. Since major changes were enacted in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson (D) and in the 1990s by President George H.W. Bush (R) — changes that allow foreign nationals to bring as many foreign relatives to the country as they want — legal immigration levels have continued booming for about five decades.

"Health secretary Matt Hancock has called for 250,000 Britons to volunteer in the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic to deliver medicines and shop for the vulnerable. The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care made the call to arms during a public announcement from Downing Street on Tuesday. Mr Hancock said: “I know how worried people are, and while this is a great time of turbulence, it is a moment, too, that the country can come together in that national effort. As the next step in that effort, today we launch NHS volunteers. “We’re seeking a quarter of a million volunteers — people in good health — to help the NHS for shopping, for delivery of medicines, and to support those who are shielded to protect their own health. “The NHS volunteer responders is a new scheme set up so people can come and help and make sure the NHS and the local services needed can get all the support they can.” “‘Your NHS Needs You’ – NHS Call For Volunteer Army,” the National Health Service said in its statement released on Tuesday. “The NHS is ‘rallying the troops’ for the war on coronavirus, with volunteers being called up to help vulnerable people stay safe and well at home,” the medical service said. Coordinated through the Good SAM app, members of the public who are fit and healthy can help the 1.5 million vulnerable people who have been asked to isolate themselves. Vital, but simple, tasks include: picking up and delivering medicines from the pharmacy; driving patients to appointments, and to and from hospital; and calling people isolating at home to check on their welfare. This group of volunteers is on top of the thousands of other individuals who have volunteered for projects to support their communities up and down the country during the coronavirus crisis. London Exhibition Centre Will Be Converted Into 4,000 Bed Coronavirus Hospital https://t.co/m6dLaKB6Q0 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 24, 2020  The call comes after the health secretary revealed that 4,500 recently-retired medical professionals had volunteered in the first 48 hours after the government called for its experienced staff to return to work at NHS hospitals, the front line in the battle against the Chinese virus. To date, that number has nearly tripled to 11,788, which included 6,147 nurses, 2,660 doctors, and other pharmacists and health professionals, with Mr Hancock remarking: “I pay tribute to every single one of those who are returning to the NHS at its time of need.” A further 5,500 final-year student doctors and 18,700 final year nursing students “will move to the front line to make sure we have the people we need in our NHS to respond to this crisis”; in total, there are over 35,000 more medical staff joining, or rejoining, the NHS. The UK’s outbreak is around two weeks behind that of Italy, which has seen over 6,000 deaths and is the coronavirus hotspot for Europe, the continent itself being the global epicentre for the pandemic. Tuesday saw the British death toll rise by 87 to 422, the biggest daily rise in the country on record. On Monday, the prime minister ordered a lockdown of the whole country to prevent the spread of coronavirus. After reports that some people were not heeding instructions, government minister Michael Gove told Britons: “Unless people take appropriate steps now, then the NHS will be under more strain. If the NHS is under more strain, then those that we love, those that we care for most, are at risk of losing their lives.” PICTURES: Army Delivers Supplies to Hospital During Coronavirus Lockdown https://t.co/iJZJqyqtH9 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 24, 2020 ","Your NHS Needs YOU: Govt Calls for Army of 250,000 Volunteers",2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/24/your-nhs-needs-you-govt-calls-army-250000-volunteers/,Breitbart
"Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told Breitbart News exclusively that President Donald Trump in the coming days will work with his medical and scientific advisers to make a determination on how and when to reopen the country after wide-scale closure in the effort to stop the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Azar is one of Trump’s closest advisers and a top member of Vice President Mike Pence’s Coronavirus Task Force to lead the American response to this crisis. He said that the president will consult with White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Dr. Stephen Hahn, among others, about the so-called “curve” of the disease and how effective the extraordinary measures to stop its spread taken by Americans nationwide have been. “The president will look at the data with his top medical advisers, people like Dr. Debbie Birx, Tony Fauci, Robert Redfield, Steve Hahn at FDA, as well as I’m sure outside advisers, and will make a decision in the next week whether to continue the 15 days or whether there are appropriate modifications he would make to the rest of the country,” Azar told Breitbart News in a phone interview on Tuesday afternoon. “For instance, whether it’s to look, as Dr. Birx I believe said yesterday in the press conference, to look at maybe focusing in localized areas instead of common national recommendations.” “But that will be from what his advisers are seeing in the data, where the hotspots are, and whether we’re seeing communities that have taken these types of efforts and actually lived up to them, if you’re seeing a bending of the curve from an epidemiological perspective,” he explained. “That might be difficult because with epidemiological data there’s always a lag in terms of what you’re seeing, so some of this, in terms of the advice from his top scientific advisers, will be based on their experience and expertise, and I’m sure the president will have to balance against that the very valid concerns about the impact on the economy and the social fabric in the United States against those restrictions.” The data that the president and his team of doctors and scientists will consider as they make their decision on reopening America, Azar said, is most importantly mortality rates of the disease—but also infection rates and other data. “Dr. Birx said yesterday at the press conference the most important data point you look at that is essentially irrefutable is mortality data,” Azar said. “How many people are dying from Covid-19? That will be your firmest bit of data in assessing the situation. You will also look at infection rates and new cases, but the problem there is you never can test everybody. So the testing gives you an indicator and gives you a trend, but it is certainly less secure information than mortality data that you would look at.” Trump, later on Tuesday after Azar’s interview with Breitbart News, said during a Fox News town hall that he hopes to reopen much of the United States by Easter Sunday, April 12. Trump, with Dr. Birx standing alongside him on Monday evening in the White House briefing room, began signaling the reopening of the country. He seems to have an ally in New York’s Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has also voiced support for reopening the country. President Trump has called this fight against the virus a “war” against an “invisible enemy” and has noted how people are calling him a “wartime president” in responding to the crisis. If that’s the case, that Trump is leading an American war again the virus, then that means Azar is one of the president’s generals in this war. In that vein, asked how President Trump is approaching this from a wartime perspective, Azar explained that Trump has rallied the whole country against the coronavirus in much the same way President Woodrow Wilson did in World War I or President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in World War II. “President Trump as our commander in chief has been marshaling every resource, not just of our government but of the economy as well, in the way that President Wilson in World War I would have or President Roosevelt in World War II,” Azar said. “That’s where you see the complete mobilization of the production capacity of the United States to make sure we have the personal protective equipment and supplies, that we have ventilators, that we have hospital capacities, that we can handle the surge—that we have the same country that did the Manhattan Project develop a vaccine within three days, three days of getting the Chinese sequence, we have a vaccine candidate that is now in human testing eight weeks after that was developed at a historically fast rate, that we marshal all of our resources to therapeutics. So it’s really that kind of mentality that President Trump leads, like a wartime president in harvesting every aspect of the government, the economy, and the social order towards defeating an enemy.” What’s more, while President Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act through which the federal government can compel companies to make products necessary for addressing the national emergency, he has not needed to actually force any company to make any product as of this time because companies are stepping up and helping voluntarily. Azar told Breitbart News this is because the president has rallied the whole country behind his “Whole of America” approach to winning this war. “Because of President Trump’s leadership and his call to action, he has mobilized the entire economy,” Azar said. “We see this and we see companies coming forward and saying ‘how can I help?’ Not saying ‘How can I help and pay me’ even, but just ‘how can I help?’ You’ve heard of major auto manufacturers saying that we will make ventilators for the country, you’ve seen industrial suppliers come forward and say ‘I have half a million or a million N95 respirators’—those are the masks—‘here, have them, I’m giving them to you’ instead of the days where they might put a markup on that, and say ‘I’ve got them but here’s a price.’ The president has called all of the country towards this war on the invisible enemy. They’re coming forward, and so while we have those authorities if we need to, I have been very impressed by the nation’s manufacturers in particular coming forward to do everything they can do to help our country.” Azar also said that regarding critical supply chains for key pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and devices, this crisis has highlighted President Trump’s vision—which he has believed and fought for even before coronavirus—pushing for bringing manufacturing back home domestically is correct. Azar also said that he is not concerned that any critical medications will be withheld from foreign countries, including especially China, despite some rumblings from Chinese state media about threats to withhold medicines from the U.S. amid this crisis. “These are complex multi-billion dollar supply chains with sterile FDA-approved manufacturing, so they don’t move overnight, but this certainly has highlighted an issue President Trump was already concerned about which is thinking about medical products as strategic products for the safety of our country and thinking in the future about how that supply chain needs to reside and be less dependent on foreign sources,” Azar said. “I’m confident that President Trump in his dealings with President Xi and China will ensure that we have access to products that we need if they’re able to be produced. That’s why it’s good that China has bent its curve and is getting back to work and is reopening factories. I’m sure President Trump will, as he always does, fight for the American worker and fight for our healthcare in working with any country.” On chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, anti-malarial drugs that have shown anecdotal promise in treating people who become infected with coronavirus, Azar said that Trump’s vision as president on this matter and more broadly with the field of emerging medicines for patients in dire need has been clear. He called Trump the “Right to Try president” after the president’s successful efforts in getting exploratory treatments to patients in need, and said Trump is aiming to follow that same vision of bringing hope to the public with these experimental and thus-far-untested medications. “This is an example of President Trump’s longstanding commitment to patients in distress have access to even experimental therapies as long as they go in with their eyes open that there are risks with unproven therapies that have not been established as safe for use by the FDA,” Azar said. “The president will leave no stone unturned to be sure that there are therapeutics available for people to try. Remember, this is the Right to Try president. This is the president who was the first to get Right to Try legislation so that people who have no hope could have new hope on new therapies that haven’t yet been proven but could give that a try. That’s the same mentality he’s bringing here to COVID-19, which is if there are products that doctors think might be helpful, we need to make sure there are no regulatory barriers to the doctors being able to use them if they might be able to save a patient’s life.” Azar concluded the interview by again laying out the end game in the effort to eradicate the coronavirus and what steps the government is taking to crush it and be ready in case it comes back later. “Diseases have a natural curve to them,” Azar said. “That’s why we talk about the ‘curve.’ There’s a natural increase and then decrease with any disease, whether that’s the nature of the disease or, as what happens with most respiratory illnesses, a seasonality whereas as warmer weather approaches people engage in natural social distancing—they’re outside and more spread out—or even as the disease responds unfavorably to humid and warmer conditions. That’s why our goal is if we can delay this curve through the president’s historic actions and contain it and keep it outside of our borders with restrictions on travel from China, from Europe, and from Iran et cetera—or with our 15 Days to Slow the Spread action to flatten that curve and to make sure during its impact that it’s not overtaxing our health care system’s capacity. There will be a natural decline in that curve. It will happen. We use that time effectively to develop a vaccine and therapeutics so that in the event that the curve returns with a wave in the fall or next winter, if there’s seasonality and it were to come back, we will continue to work on those longer-term efforts like therapies and vaccines.”","Exclusive–The Endgame: HHS Secretary Alex Azar Lays Out How Trump Will Defeat Coronavirus ‘Invisible Enemy,’ Reopen America",2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/exclusive-hhs-secretary-alex-azar-lays-out-how-trump-will-defeat-coronavirus-invisible-enemy-reopen-america/,Breitbart
"Lawyers for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange reportedly plan to apply for his release on bail based on the risk of contracting the Wuhan coronavirus while imprisoned. Fox News reports that lawyers for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as requesting that Assange be released on bail as he is currently at risk of contracting the Chinese virus while imprisoned. Assange is currently being held in the U.K. and is facing extradition to the United States over the leaking of classified government documents over 10 years ago. Assange is facing a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison. The official WikiLeaks account retweeted a tweet stating that Assange’s lawyers will apply for bail at court on Wednesday: BREAKING: Assange’s lawyers have announced that they will be applying for bail at court this Wednesday, 25 March. They argue that he is in imminent danger from Coronavirus spreading through the prison population and should be released for his and other prisoners and staff safety. pic.twitter.com/pVjglPPi80 — Don't Extradite Assange (@DEAcampaign) March 23, 2020  Assange’s lawyers are arguing that their client “is in imminent danger from coronavirus spreading through the prison population and should be released for his and other prisoners’ and staff’s safety.” U.S. prosecutors are accusing Assange of conspiring with U.S. Army Intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer in order to release thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. U.S. prosecutors allege that the publication of the unedited documents by WikiLeaks put U.S. intelligence sources at risk of torture or death. The request to release Assange on bail comes as the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic escalates worldwide, last week Iran freed approximately 85,000 inmates from its prisons in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

"President Donald Trump joked on Tuesday during a Fox News town hall that former Vice President Joe Biden did not know the meaning of the word “xenophobic.” Trump said that Biden was opposed to his decision to ban travel from China, recalling the former vice president called it “xenophobic.” “I don’t know if he knows what that means, but that’s okay,” Trump said. “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering,” Biden said in January after Trump enacted the ban. Joe Biden opposed the China travel restrictions wisely put in place by President Trump in January – restrictions that health experts credit with slowing the spread of coronavirus & saving lives.

"Online Lenders Alliance CEO Mary Jackson told Breitbart News in a statement on Tuesday that Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Chris Van Hollen’s (D-MD) legislation to cap consumer lending rates during the coronavirus outbreak would cut off Americans’ access to credit. Brown and Van Hollen’s legislation would temporarily cap consumer lending rates, also known as usury rates, at 36 percent during the coronavirus outbreak. The Democrat senators, who have also voted to block the bipartisan coronavirus package, urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to include the proposal in the coronavirus bill. Brown said in a statement on Sunday: Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, supported the proposal. She said: It’s astonishing that even in this emergency predatory lenders are exploiting people’s hardships by charging 100% APR or more. A temporary 36% rate cap would put a stop to that. I applaud Senator Van Hollen and Senator Brown for their efforts on this issue. In contrast, Jackson told Breitbart News in a statement that capping consumer lending rates would cut off access to credit, especially for Americans with lower credit ratings. Jackson explained: Now is not the time to take away credit options from non-prime consumers by limiting annual interest rates on short-term loans. Those who see the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to cap interest rates will hurt non-prime consumers who need access to credit now more than ever. A temporary rate cap is a temporary ban on credit options that consumers need as they face other financial difficulties. A rate cap of 36 percent has already been tested with the Military Lending Act and the results are in: it eliminated credit options and left servicemembers facing financial insecurity, missed payments, dependency on charity, and depleted savings. She added, “It is irresponsible to include it in any COVID-19 aid package. Consumers are facing unprecedented financial stresses, and they need options.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"The Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) has filed suit against New Jersey Gov. Philip D. Murphy and State Police Supt. Col. Patrick J. Callahan over the forced closure of gun stores throughout the state during the coronavirus crisis. Governor Murphy ordered a statewide shutdown of all “non-essential businesses,” and that shut down took effect on March 21, 2020, at 9 p.m. Gun and ammunition stores were not included as essential in Murphy’s order. Moreover, the shutdown was followed by a state police announcement that background checks for gun sales would no longer be performed during the coronavirus crisis. SAF responded by filing suit to defend the civil rights of New Jersey residents. The suit, Robert Kashinsky, Racing Rails LLC d/b/a Legend Firearms; New Jersey Second Amendment Society; Second Amendment Foundation, Inc., v.  PHILIP D. MURPHY, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of New Jersey; and PATRICK J. CALLAHAN, in his official capacity as State Director of Emergency Management and as Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, was filed March 23, 2019, in the United States District Court District of New Jersey. The text of the suit says: This lawsuit challenges the Defendants’ acts of mandating the closure of all retail businesses that sell firearms or ammunition and of making the portal for firearms background checks unavailable on the website of the New Jersey State Police. Taken together, these actions amount to a ban on obtaining firearms or ammunition in the State of New Jersey. The suit does not diminish the seriousness of the cornonavirus crisis. However, Plaintiffs note that ” this emergency (like any other emergency) has its constitutional limits. It would not justify a prior restraint on speech, nor a suspension of the right to vote. Just the same, it does not justify a ban on obtaining guns and ammunition.” SAF’s Alan Gottlieb commented on the shutdown of gun sales in New Jersey, saying, “In order for New Jersey residents to purchase firearms, they must go through a licensed firearms retailer and pass a background check. However, Murphy’s order was subsequently followed by a notice posted on the State Police website that the agency is no longer conducting background checks.” Gottlieb added, “Gov. Murphy cannot simply suspend the Second Amendment, and neither can Supt. Callahan. Yet, under this emergency order, that’s exactly what they’re doing. The Constitution, and federal law, don’t allow that. New Jersey may have been the first state to ratify the Bill of Rights, but they’re the last state to recognize it.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"President Donald Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday that he wanted to get the economy reopened by Easter. “I’d love to have it open by Easter,” Trump said, setting a date for reopening the country for the first time. Easter is on April 12. “I would love to have the country opened up and rearing to go by Easter,” he repeated. “That would be a great American resurrection,” Fox News moderator Bill Hemer replied. The president has promised to listen to his doctors and advisers on loosening restrictions set by the government to fight the coronavirus pandemic, but has said would ultimately make the final decision. Trump appeared upbeat during the event, pleased that the stock market rose over 1,600 points on Tuesday. He said he looked forward to the day that Americans could go to work, noting that a massive economic depression had its own death toll. “We can socially distance ourselves and go to work, and you’ll have to work a little bit harder,” Trump said. “You can clean your hands five times as more as you used to, you don’t have to shake hands anymore with people.” Trump said again that he wanted the economy reopened in weeks, not months and suggested that the United States would be ready. “It’s not built to shut down,” he said. “Our people are full of vim and vigor and energy. They don’t want to be locked in a house or an apartment or some space,” he said. The president said that putting restrictions on Americans last week was “one of the most difficult decisions that he ever made.” “You’re basically turning off the country,” he said, adding that, “I wasn’t happy about it, and I also knew I had to do it.” Trump said that the economic shutdown was “painful” and “destabilizing” but that it would soon be time for Americans to return to their lives. “We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought, and people can go back to work and they can also practice good judgment,” he said. Dr. Deborah Birx said during the town hall that she would continue looking at the data, and urged Americans to continue following the restrictions set by the Centers for Disease Control.",Donald Trump on Reopening Economy: ‘I’d Love to Have it Open by Easter’,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/donald-trump-on-reopening-economy-id-love-to-have-it-open-by-easter/,Breitbart
"Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said President Donald Trump’s plan for the country to return to regular business activity soon was based on “notion mongering.” Mitchell asked, “The president tweeted today, ‘Our people want to return to work.’ He said, ‘They will practice social distance over all else, and senior citizens watched over lovingly. We can do two things together. The cure cannot be worse than the problem. We will come back strong.’ He suggested last night on Twitter and his briefing today that he thinks people should go back sooner than later, which is in contradiction with his own task force, Dr. Fauci and others. What would be your message about whether as reluctant people are to see the economy tank, whether we have to get past this surge, whether we can consider coming back? And it is going to be more than two weeks.” Pelosi said, “As I said, this is not a time for notion mongering, it is a time for serious, evidence-based, scientific decision making — scientists speaking truth to power. You can look at the examples around the world, and where there was confinement, where people stayed at home — look at China, Wuhan, they didn’t do this early enough 100,000 cases. In Singapore and Hong Kong, where they acted differently, a tiny percentage of that number infected. So when the president said you ask the doctors, they want to shut everything down, I  think that was one of his other tributes to science, you can’t go to that place and cost to the economy of many more people getting infected and sick is a bigger cost than what we’ve been seeing now. We don’t want that to happen.” She added, “What the president is suggesting is really a formula for more uncertainty, more infections, and more harm to the economy.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Pelosi: This Is Not the Time For Trump’s ‘Notion Mongering’ — It’s Time for Science,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/24/pelosi-this-is-not-the-time-for-trumps-notion-mongering-its-time-for-science/,Breitbart

President Trump has called this fight against the virus a “war” against an “invisible enemy” and has noted how people are calling him a “wartime president” in responding to the crisis. If that’s the case, that Trump is leading an American war again the virus, then that means Azar is one of the president’s generals in this war. In that vein, asked how President Trump is approaching this from a wartime perspective, Azar explained that Trump has rallied the whole country against the coronavirus in much the same way President Woodrow Wilson did in World War I or President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in World War II. “President Trump as our commander in chief has been marshaling every resource, not just of our government but of the economy as well, in the way that President Wilson in World War I would have or President Roosevelt in World War II,” Azar said. “That’s where you see the complete mobilization of the production capacity of the United States to make sure we have the personal protective equipment and supplies, that we have ventilators, that we have hospital capacities, that we can handle the surge—that we have the same country that did the Manhattan Project develop a vaccine [candidate] within three days, three days of getting the Chinese sequence, we have a vaccine candidate that is now in human testing eight weeks after that was developed at a historically fast rate, that we marshal all of our resources to therapeutics. So it’s really that kind of mentality that President Trump leads, like a wartime president in harvesting every aspect of the government, the economy, and the social order towards defeating an enemy.” What’s more, while President Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act through which the federal government can compel companies to make products necessary for addressing the national emergency, he has not needed to actually force any company to make any product as of this time because companies are stepping up and helping voluntarily. Azar told Breitbart News this is because the president has rallied the whole country behind his “Whole of America” approach to winning this war. “Because of President Trump’s leadership and his call to action, he has mobilized the entire economy,” Azar said. “We see this and we see companies coming forward and saying ‘how can I help?’ Not saying ‘How can I help and pay me’ even, but just ‘how can I help?’ You’ve heard of major auto manufacturers saying that we will make ventilators for the country, you’ve seen industrial suppliers come forward and say ‘I have half a million or a million N95 respirators’—those are the masks—‘here, have them, I’m giving them to you’ instead of the days where they might put a markup on that, and say ‘I’ve got them but here’s a price.’ The president has called all of the country towards this war on the invisible enemy. They’re coming forward, and so while we have those authorities if we need to, I have been very impressed by the nation’s manufacturers in particular coming forward to do everything they can do to help our country.” Azar also said that regarding critical supply chains for key pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and devices, this crisis has highlighted President Trump’s vision—which he has believed and fought for even before coronavirus—pushing for bringing manufacturing back home domestically is correct. Azar also said that he is not concerned that any critical medications will be withheld from foreign countries, including especially China, despite some rumblings from Chinese state media about threats to withhold medicines from the U.S. amid this crisis. “These are complex multi-billion dollar supply chains with sterile FDA-approved manufacturing, so they don’t move overnight, but this certainly has highlighted an issue President Trump was already concerned about which is thinking about medical products as strategic products for the safety of our country and thinking in the future about how that supply chain needs to reside and be less dependent on foreign sources,” Azar said. “I’m confident that President Trump in his dealings with President Xi and China will ensure that we have access to products that we need if they’re able to be produced. That’s why it’s good that China has bent its curve and is getting back to work and is reopening factories. I’m sure President Trump will, as he always does, fight for the American worker and fight for our healthcare in working with any country.” On chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, anti-malarial drugs that have shown anecdotal promise in treating people who become infected with coronavirus, Azar said that Trump’s vision as president on this matter and more broadly with the field of emerging medicines for patients in dire need has been clear. He called Trump the “Right to Try president” after the president’s successful efforts in getting exploratory treatments to patients in need, and said Trump is aiming to follow that same vision of bringing hope to the public with these experimental and thus-far-untested medications. “This is an example of President Trump’s longstanding commitment to patients in distress have access to even experimental therapies as long as they go in with their eyes open that there are risks with unproven therapies that have not been established as safe for use by the FDA,” Azar said. “The president will leave no stone unturned to be sure that there are therapeutics available for people to try. Remember, this is the Right to Try president. This is the president who was the first to get Right to Try legislation so that people who have no hope could have new hope on new therapies that haven’t yet been proven but could give that a try. That’s the same mentality he’s bringing here to COVID-19, which is if there are products that doctors think might be helpful, we need to make sure there are no regulatory barriers to the doctors being able to use them if they might be able to save a patient’s life.” Azar concluded the interview by again laying out the end game in the effort to eradicate the coronavirus and what steps the government is taking to crush it and be ready in case it comes back later. “Diseases have a natural curve to them,” Azar said. “That’s why we talk about the ‘curve.’ There’s a natural increase and then decrease with any disease, whether that’s the nature of the disease or, as what happens with most respiratory illnesses, a seasonality whereas as warmer weather approaches people engage in natural social distancing—they’re outside and more spread out—or even as the disease responds unfavorably to humid and warmer conditions. That’s why our goal is if we can delay this curve through the president’s historic actions and contain it and keep it outside of our borders with restrictions on travel from China, from Europe, and from Iran et cetera—or with our 15 Days to Slow the Spread action to flatten that curve and to make sure during its impact that it’s not overtaxing our health care system’s capacity. There will be a natural decline in that curve. It will happen. We use that time effectively to develop a vaccine and therapeutics so that in the event that the curve returns with a wave in the fall or next winter, if there’s seasonality and it were to come back, we will continue to work on those longer-term efforts like therapies and vaccines.”","Exclusive–The Endgame: HHS Secretary Alex Azar Lays Out How Trump Will Defeat Coronavirus ‘Invisible Enemy,’ Reopen America",2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/exclusive-hhs-secretary-alex-azar-lays-out-how-trump-will-defeat-coronavirus-invisible-enemy-reopen-america/,Breitbart

"Consider Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) not in favor of President Donald Trump’s remarks contrasting the solution to the coronavirus pandemic with the pandemic itself. On Monday, Trump publicly echoed a sentiment he shared in a tweet suggesting that the dangers of the cure could be worse than the problem. “We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem,” Trump said. “We have to open our country because that causes problems that, in my opinion, could be far bigger problems.” WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020  In an interview that aired Tuesday on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Jones criticized Trump for the remarks, arguing the statement was inconsistent with what scientists and health care officials were saying. “I think it was dumb of the president to say it,” Jones said on “The Jeff Poor Show.” “I’m just going to be candid about it. It was not consistent with anything the scientists are saying. It’s not consistent with anything the health care officials in Alabama, from Huntsville to Mobile — there is no one saying that except people that are losing money in their stock portfolio. It really angers me to hear the president say it. And then for people to take that as gospel because the only way — this is a health crisis. If we can get past the health crisis, we will then get past the economic crisis.” “They are connected,” he continued. “You cannot separate those two. And it is crazy to think — this is not the meltdown of 2008 and that great recession. This is creating serious problems with the health of Americans. It is creating serious problems with people’s health worldwide.

"Americans are growing more concerned over the state of the American economy than that of their personal health, a Harris Poll released this week revealed. The survey, fielded March 21-22 among 2,023 U.S. adults, found that a majority of Americans, 61 percent, now consider the amount of fear in society as “sensible given how serious the [coronavirus] pandemic has become.” That reflects a 15-point jump from the 46 percent of Americans who viewed the fear as warranted last week. The survey also reviewed the issues people are “increasingly concerned about” and found that concerns over the economy surpass all other worries, including personal health. Eighty-four percent of respondents, surveyed March 13-14, said they were growing increasingly concerned over the state of the economy, but at the time, worries over the health of older friends and relatives topped the list, with 86 percent. While those concerns have risen over the course of the last week, worries over the economy now top the list, with 91 percent of Americans indicating unease. Meanwhile, 75 percent say they are concerned about their personal health, 90 percent say they are worried about older relatives and friends, and 87 percent indicate concern over the health of Americans “broadly.” The survey comes as lawmakers fight for an agreement on bipartisan economic relief legislation. Democrats blocked the measure over the weekend after receiving what appeared to be marching orders from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who flew into D.C. on Sunday — the same day GOP lawmakers claim the negotiations completely fell apart. President Trump said on Tuesday that he would like to have the U.S. economy reopened by Easter on April 12. “I would love to have the country opened up and rearing to go by Easter,” he said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday. “We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought, and people can go back to work and they can also practice good judgment,” he added.",Poll: Americans Growing More Concerned over Economy Than Personal Heath,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/poll-americans-growing-more-concerned-over-the-economy-than-their-personal-heath/,Breitbart

She also stated that the coronavirus, also referred to as COVID-19, was “Chinese-born,” amid Chinese attempts to falsely blame U.S. Army soldiers for bringing the coronavirus to China. “The Communist government of China knowingly withheld critical information needed to combat the spread of the Chinese-born COVID-19 and to this day continues to spread lies and disinformation on the origin of the deadly virus,” she said. “There is no doubt that China’s unconscionable decision to orchestrate an elaborate coverup of the wide-ranging and deadly implications of coronavirus led to the death of thousands of people, including hundreds of Americans and climbing,” she said. “This Resolution calls for China to provide compensation for the harm, loss, and destruction their arrogance brought upon the rest of the world.

"Reps. Jim Banks (R-IN) and Seth Moulton (D-MA) introduced a bill condemning the Chinese government for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, in a sign of bipartisan anger against China. The bill expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the “Governmentof the People’s Republic of China made multiple, serious mistakes in the early stages of the COVID–19 outbreak that heightened the severity and spread of the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic.” The text said those mistakes: …include the Chinese Government’s intentional spread of misinformation to downplay the risks of the virus, a refusal to cooperate with international health authorities, internal censorship of doctors and journalists, and malicious disregard for the health of ethnic minorities. Banks, a U.S. Navy reservist, said in a statement: As the Chinese Communist Party pushes propaganda and lies to try and blame the United States for coronavirus, we need to make the case to the world that China is ultimately responsible for this outbreak. They tried to cover-up news of the virus, jailed doctors warning of a possible pandemic, and prevented the CDC from coming to study the disease. In all, they cost the globe two months in time to prepare for this virus. I hope this begins a conversation about how China can be held accountable for their negligent coronavirus response. Moulton, a Marine veteran, said in a statement: The Chinese Communist Party’s leaders responded to the coronavirus outbreak first with disinformation and misdirection. China’s leaders kicked out American journalists who were covering the virus’ spread and the lives it claimed. China’s leaders silenced doctors, some of whom died sounding the alarm to the world. And while the clock was ticking, China’s leaders were focused on spreading propaganda that said the American military caused the virus, downplaying its severity.

"The chair of the board of the American Association of Prolife OB/GYNs (AAPLOG) says moving forward with abortions during the coronavirus pandemic is “medically irresponsible,” at a time when medical equipment is much needed to treat victims of the illness. Dr. Christina Francis reacted recently to a statement by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and other organizations that urged health professionals “to ensure abortion access is not compromised” during the coronavirus pandemic. “Abortions use up much-needed resources such as masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment,” Francis told LifeSiteNews. Francis’s organization is one of five groups of physicians that, collectively, represent over 30,000 doctors and medical professionals who are condemning ACOG’s representation of abortion as essential health care. The coalition of medical groups said in a statement: In such an uncertain and tumultuous time, the entire healthcare profession is being called upon to conserve resources and healthcare professionals to an extent never seen before. And yet, in the midst of this call, while hospitals are postponing elective procedures and many outpatient clinics are rescheduling non-essential office visits, the abortion industry continues with business as usual. As Breitbart News reported, Planned Parenthood has been defying an Ohio order to discontinue elective abortions during the coronavirus pandemic, even though its abortion clinics are using up valuable personal protective equipment (PPE) that is needed by medical personnel who are treating the infection caused by the virus. The abortion industry says abortions are “business as usual” during the pandemic: Abortion is an essential and time-sensitive medical procedure — and it must remain so during this public health crisis. Delays or additional barriers to care can make it more difficult or even impossible for patients to access safe, legal abortion. #COVID19 — Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) March 24, 2020  Abortion is essential for people’s health and wellbeing. That’s why clinic  doors are staying open. https://t.co/lv55KmompW — NARAL (@NARAL) March 22, 2020  In an op-ed at the Wall Street Journal, however, Francis wrote ACOG “routinely puts politics ahead of medicine by adopting the most extreme positions on abortion.” She explained further: It has lobbied and briefed against parental notification of minors and informed-consent laws, and in favor of taxpayer-funded abortion. It has advocated for laws restricting speech around clinics and compelling pro-life pregnancy centers to tell women where they can go to obtain state-subsidized abortions. ACOG’s work has gotten so political that in 2008 it added a lobbying arm. I was refused when I asked if I could direct our dues only to the organization’s nonlobbying arm. Francis added that, with all of ACOG’s promotion of abortion, 86 percent of all OB/GYNs do not perform the procedure. “[B]ut ACOG’s position is that you either support the most extreme abortion lobbying or you’re off the island,” she observed. “Most of ACOG’s abortion advocacy is undertaken free of consultation with its almost 60,000 members.” The coalition of physicians’ groups states, “Elective abortion is neither ‘essential’ nor ‘urgent,’ but it does consume critical resources such as masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment, and unnecessarily exposes patients and physicians to pathogens.” The doctors note that continuing abortions – some of which are likely to develop complications – place greater stress on a healthcare system that is under tremendous pressure at the current time: Most abortion providers instruct women to go to an emergency room if they have any concerning symptoms after the abortion. Approximately 5% of women who undergo medication abortions will require evaluation in an emergency room, most commonly for hemorrhage. Surgical abortions can also result in hemorrhage. Emergency room personnel – who are already struggling to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic – will be further strained to provide care to these women. “The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Pediatricians, Christian Medical & Dental Associations, the Catholic Medical Association, and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons call for all elective abortions to be suspended in accordance with the current CDC recommendations pertaining to elective procedures and office visits,” the coalition asserts.",OB/GYN: Continuing Abortions During Pandemic ‘Medically Irresponsible’,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/ob-gyn-continuing-abortions-during-pandemic-medically-irresponsible/,Breitbart

He recalled watching a church service of his own from the White House. “Online is never going to be like being there,” he said.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hosted a virtual town hall on coronavirus on Monday evening — but like rival Joe Biden, he found it difficult not to touch his face, as per medical guidelines. The online meeting featured Rep. Priya Jayapal (D-WA), who introduced the House version of Sanders’s “Medicare for All” bill last year. (The bill eliminates private health insurance, among other provisions.) Sanders was also joined by doctors and experts to discuss ways that policymakers could respond to urgent medical needs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as strategies for individuals to cope. At one point, speaking with Dr. Rishi Desai about emergency medical care in underserved areas, Sanders clasped both hands to his mouth in a thoughtful posture. Later, he rested his face on his hand.  Biden has also been criticized for touching his face while on live interviews from his home. CNN’s Jake Tapper also corrected the former vice president earlier on Tuesday when he coughed into his hand instead of his elbow. President Donald Trump was also criticized for shaking hands during a press conference earlier this month at which he declared a national emergency over coronavirus. On Monday, Sanders told a reporter to back away from him, citing “social distancing” guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. Sanders, whose tech-savvy campaigns have live-streamed many events since 2016, guided Tuesday’s online discussion himself. He said he did not want to politicize the issue, but said the coronavirus outbreak should prompt questions such as: “Why don’t we have health care as a human right?”. Two weeks ago, Sanders called for President Donald Trump to be replaced by “experts” and Congress in handling the issue. As of Tuesday evening, Congress had yet to pass emergency relief funding to help the economy through the crisis. Sanders missed a vote related to pending legislation on Sunday due to another livestream, and voted against cloture — which would move the bill toward a vote — on Monday. Sanders’s latest livestream took place at the same time the Senate debated the legislation again. Joel B.

The unusual phrases — “intending immigrants, and workers’ ability” — covers the many foreign visa workers who are not legal immigrants but are merely contract workers holding jobs in the United States. The Democrats’ bill is a massive giveaway to Silicon Valley, to tech donors, and to many Fortune 500 companies in the banking and insurance industries who have replaced their American graduates with blocs of imported Indian and Chinese workers. Many investors, CEOs, and human resources managers prefer the visa workers over Americans, in part, because they can be quickly hired or fired via a network of Indian-run subcontractors and sub-subcontractors. The visa workers are also preferred because they are compliant and legally powerless — the visa workers cannot complain, organize, demand higher wages, or even argue with managers because they know they can be swiftly deported without any legal recourse. The massive supply of foreign workers also raises stock values by cutting white-collar salaries — although many of the visa workers are paid in line with Americans. The visa worker population includes roughly 1.5 million college graduates, mostly from India, even though roughly 800,000 Americans graduate from college with skilled technical degrees each year. Roughly 400,000 of these temporary workers can stay permanently in the United States because their employers have nominated them to eventually become legal residents. But every year, hundreds of thousands of visa workers are forced to go home because their visas expire after a few months, a year, three years, or five years, even after also getting a one-year or a multi-year extension. Yet each year, the departing visa workers are replaced by another wave of arriving college graduate workers. However, the Democrats’ offer of extended visas does not include any curbs on the arrival of new workers, for example, the annual arrival of 100,000 new H-1B graduate workers. So the bill’s extensions may add at least 100,000 foreign graduates to the labor market in 2020, just as millions of American graduates scramble to find new jobs. The Department of Homeland Security told Breitbart News on March 19 that it has no plans to change the H-1B inflow in 2020. Democrats' coronavirus recovery bill sells out America's college-graduate class by expanding job-competition from desperate foreign grads amid the economic crash. IOW, it is a huge giveaway to Silicon Valley & business donors.''Foreign Graduates First'https://t.co/LR1qpNjLPH — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 23, 2020  Foreign college graduates allowed to work in the United States via a plethora of visa programs that are almost entirely ignored by the establishment press. They include the H-1B, L-1, Occupational Practical Training, Curricular Practical Training, TN, E-3, J-1, and B-1 programs, as well as a variety of science-related “post-docs” given to young scientists in university classrooms and laboratories. The biggest program is the H-1B program. It keeps a population of roughly 900,000 H-1B workers in the United States, largely because the H-1B workers are allowed to stay six years, and many can stay long past their visa expiration once employers merely nominate them for green cards. Similarly, more than 400,000 foreigners get work permits via the OPT and CPT programs by paying tuition fees to a wide variety or elite, average, or low-tier colleges. Most get one-year work permits, but 70,000 get three-year “STEM-OPT” work permits. ""With predictions of unemployment as high as 30%, it is unconscionable for House Democrats to use the Coronavirus response bill to actually harm American workers."" — Roy Beck, President, NumbersUSA — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 24, 2020  The visa programs also include the H-2B program for the blue-collar workers who are imported by landscaping and resort employers, as well as the H-2A workers who are imported by farm companies. The J-1 program includes thousands of doctors — and at least 100,000 blue-collar seasonal workers. The visa programs co-exist with a variety of work permits of recent blue-collar migrants, such as the migrants who crossed the border in 2019 and long-resident illegal aliens who ask for an “Adjustment of Status” to citizenship. This work permit category also includes the roughly 600,000 young illegal aliens in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals created by Obama in 2012. Very few of the DACA migrants hold university credentials. Each year, the federal government awards temporary “Employment Authorization Documents” to roughly two million foreigners. The Democrats’ legislative language is not included in the summary of the 1,400-page bill, But a prior 1,119-page draft directs officials to simply extend existing one-year and multi-year visas that expire during the next 12 months. At a time when millions of Americans could lose their jobs, Pelosi’s bill includes a measure to automatically extend nonimmigrant work visas. https://t.co/t1n9nWFC0W pic.twitter.com/MvXTKrBnIn — Ben Goldey (@BenGoldey) March 23, 2020  The language could actually increase the number of foreign workers who will compete for scarce jobs sought by Ameican graduates in the economic meltdown. For example, the language seems to provide three-year extensions to one-third of the roughly 70,000 foreigners with “STEM-OPT” permits. That extension would likely increase the STEM-OPT workforce by 25 percent in 2021 and 2022 — even if no STEM-OPT permits are approved in 2020. American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers, and White Collar Workers of America. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption. In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher. Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.

"President Donald Trump’s economic policies ushered in an economic boom the likes of which we had not seen in decades, if ever. Now, faced with a pandemic that has ground the world’s economy to a halt, the President faces the unenviable task of trying to head off an immediate public health crisis without inducing a long-term economic crisis that could be even more devastating to the well-being of the American people. So while it is important that the President continue receiving advice from medical experts, as he has been with Dr. Anthony Fauci and others, his recent comments make it clear that he is also smartly taking into account the human impact of the economic decisions he is facing. This type of multivariate analysis is at the heart of every difficult decision a president has to make. While armchair analysts have the luxury of cherry-picking stats and facts to make their points, presidents have to weigh the broad real-world impact of everything they do. And when you’re making decisions that impact all 325 million American citizens–and billions of people all around the world–there are an infinite number of variables to consider. Making these decisions must start with receiving good information, which he clearly is from the world-class experts he appointed to his coronavirus response team. Unfortunately, the media has taken the opposite approach, inundating Americans with worst-case scenarios and doomsday predictions, often from people with a political ax to grind. For instance, Andy Slavitt, one of the architects of Obamacare, predicted all the nation’s hospitals would be overrun by March 23. Obviously that turned out to not even be remotely accurate. New modeling from Oxford University’s Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group, on the other hand, implies “that fewer than one in a thousand of those infected with Covid-19 become ill enough to need hospital treatment.” Nearly all deaths from the virus are happening to people with multiple morbidity factors.  Rather than shutting down the economy for months on end, these points suggest the government should focus on protecting the most vulnerable among us while empowering most Americans to get back to work, preserve millions of jobs, and jumpstart the economy. This is exactly what the President was getting at when he tweeted, “the cure cannot be worse than the problem.” The virus has likely caused a recession. The government should not turn it into a depression by making decisions based on fear and panic. A temporary quarantine to protect the public is one thing, but enforcing long-term isolation for the entire country is a recipe for economic destruction from which we may never fully recover. Just consider the fact that the government is about to inject trillions into an economy that has been on pause for a couple of weeks — and yet we are still facing a significant uptick in unemployment and the closing of thousands of small businesses. Just imagine what many more weeks or even months of this dynamic would look like. No government bailout could ever be enough. Only the reopening of the American free-market–the greatest economic engine the world has ever known–will ensure that we rise from the ashes.  Such moves should obviously be done in the safest way possible. Some recent suggestions have included the continued isolation of older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions that put them at greater risk. The public health impact of every idea should be weighed with the seriousness it deserves. But we must also weigh the human impact of lost jobs, lost homes and lost businesses–the elimination of the pursuit of happiness, as the founders put it. Economists, small business owners, and regular hard-working Americans should not be shouted down for being callous or unreasonable for pointing out the economic impact of the decisions that are being made. During my time in the White House, I found the President to be extremely adept at listening to diverse opinions, weighing countless variables, and decisively making decisions that he believes are in the best interest of the American people.  He is now facing perhaps the most difficult decision of his presidency–will we accept economic defeat at the hands of this invisible enemy, or will we protect our people while also getting American moving again? I trust the President to make the right call. — Cliff Sims is a former Special Assistant to the President and Director of White House Message Strategy for President Donald J.

"Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is scrambling to get 30,000 ventilators from the Trump administration, keeping in mind that the peak of the coronavirus could hit New York in 14 days. Cuomo said New York needs at least 30,000 of the breathing machines to care for the brunt of the coronavirus patients expected to flood New York in the next two weeks. However, the state has only obtained 7,000 and received 400 ventilators from federal government officials. “There is no other way for us to get these ventilators,” Cuomo said at a press conference Tuesday, adding that it is an absolute necessity to get the ventilators from the federal government. Ventilators are in short supply throughout the U.S. and around the world as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. Since coronavirus is a disease of the lungs, the machines help patients who are critically ill and cannot breathe to breathe again. Cuomo said he needs more ventilators immediately to prepare for the brunt of coronavirus cases to come in two to three weeks, earlier than initial projections estimated. Cuomo and other governors have pleaded with President Donald Trump for more ventilators from the nation’s stash of medical supplies. There are about 12,700 ventilators in that stash, but Cuomo said his administration has reportedly only received 400. “What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000?” Cuomo said. “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.” Vice President Mike Pence said during a Tuesday Fox News interview that the federal government is preparing to send 4,000 ventilators to New York in the next two days. But that was not enough for Cuomo, who urged Trump to use the Defense Production Act to coerce manufacturers into making more ventilators. “So you’re asking a business to produce what is a sophisticated piece of electronic equipment, a ventilator, and to do it in 14 days. That’s an enormous undertaking. They can’t do that on a voluntary basis,” Cuomo said. Meanwhile, Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk recently announced that he sent 1,200 ventilators from China to the U.S.","Democrat NY Gov.

"Scientists have recently identified 69 drugs and experimental compounds that may be effective in combating the novel coronavirus.  On Sunday, the New York Times reported:  Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said. The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication. The Trump administration has slashed red tape to distribute unapproved therapies and vaccines to patients in need faster and to identify effective drugs. Health officials have named the virus itself SARS CoV-2 and the illness caused by the virus COVID-19.  Among the 69 drugs that scientists believe may be effective against COVID-19 is chloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria. Mainstream media outlets have blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for touting the anti-malaria drug chloroquine as a possible treatment for coronavirus patients.  The media went as far as blaming Trump for the death of an Arizona man who died after self-medicating with a fish tank cleaner that contains chloroquine. Trump’s comments about the anti-malaria drug have been in line with scientists and doctors who believe the treatment has shown anecdotal promise in treating people infected by coronavirus while acknowledging that more tests need to be conducted on the risky drug. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, the U.S. state hardest-hit by the virus, also believes the anti-malaria drugs may be effective in treating coronavirus patients, saying clinical studies will start on Tuesday.  The mainstream media has not lambasted the Democrat governor for suggesting that the anti-malaria drug may be used against coronavirus.  On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) also said it would begin trials of chloroquine and other drugs that may potentially be used against coronavirus.  The researchers trying to find treatments to use against coronavirus “sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells,” the Times noted.  Ultimately, the scientist identified 24 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDCA) to treat unrelated diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s disease, hypertension, schizophrenia, and diabetes. The Times added:  The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites. And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment. Last week, the company Distributed Bio announced it was three to four weeks away from engineering an antibody treatment to combat the novel coronavirus that can be ready to be administered to patients by the fall. ",Researchers: 69 Drugs May Be Effective Against Coronavirus Including Chloroquine,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/researchers-69-drugs-may-be-effective-against-coronavirus-including-chloroquine/,Breitbart
"The coronavirus economic rescue package expected to be approved by lawmakers shortly will amount to $6 trillion, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday evening. Kudlow’s figure includes $4 billion in asset purchases by the Federal Reserve and $2 trillion in spending authorized by Congress. The actual amount marshalled to rescue the economy from the widespread business shutdown and collapse of consumer spending could be even higher because the Fed has said it will spend unlimited amounts to buy Treasuries and other securities to support the economy. Kudlow said the package Congress is close to passing will be “the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States.” Funds appropriated by Congress will likely be funded by borrowing by the U.S. Treasury, as no offsetting spending cuts or tax hikes are being considered. The Fed’s programs will be funded out of newly created money that is offset by the Fed purchases, which remove financial assets from the private sector in amounts equal to the new dollars.",Kudlow Says Economic Rescue Will Amount to $6 Trillion,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/24/kudlow-says-economic-rescue-will-amount-to-6-trillion/,Breitbart
"Vice President Mike Pence praised the private sector in the United States at the daily briefing at the White House on Tuesday for stepping up to the plate to help the country beat the coronavirus outbreak, including more support for truckers who are preserving the country’s supply chain during the coronavirus outbreak. This includes McDonalds, the American fast food icon, which has set up curbside service at its franchises so that truck drivers can get a meal on the go. “In fact, we see industry stepping up,” Pence said. “The president mentioned Ford Motor Company working to expand production of medical supplies.” “We heard that McDonalds is now offering curbs delivery to truckers who are unable to use the drive-through to pick up a Big Mac,” Pence said.  Drive-thru stations at fast food franchises across the country have been providing meals to countless Americans during this national health emergency. As Breitbart News has reported, truckers’ vital role in fighting the coronavirus.

"Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden had several awkward exchanges with host Nicolle Wallace while apologizing for his wording. When asked how he would handle the coronavirus pandemic if he wins the election, Biden said, “Way back in January 17 I wrote a piece, maybe the 15th. I wrote a piece for “USA Today” saying that, you know, a pandemic is coming. We have to be better prepared. We should have been in a position, I called for a while ago. I would enforce, enforce the defense production act. I would be surging equipment and personnel. I would be moving in a direction where we had the United States military, which I call for several weeks ago building hospitals like finally happening in the National Guard helping in New York with, you know, at the Javits Center. We have this capacity. Most of all, I would be protecting our docs, nurses, and first responders because if we lose them, we are in real, real trouble. We should be making those masks, moving on those ventilators. We can do that. Why doesn’t he just act like a president?” Biden apologized, “That’s a stupid way to say that but I really –” Wallace who had begun her next question said, “Donald Trump was asked on —” Biden apologized again, “Sorry.” Wallace said, “Go ahead.” Biden said, “No. No. Probably best I don’t.” Wallace laughed as she said, “All right.” Later in the interview, Wallace asked, “Mr. Vice President, what do you say about the reporting in The New York Times and it’s been reported at a local level for as long as this virus has been something that people have been anxious about, that’s discrimination against Asian Americans. Donald Trump, I think, tried to put something back in the toothpaste tube yesterday but saying he wouldn’t tolerate discrimination, but that was after weeks and weeks and weeks of calling coronavirus the Chinese virus.” Biden said, “Well, I — no matter how he got there, I’m glad he finally got there. It was long overdue to say he won’t put up the xenophobia. Strange coming from him, but I’m happy he did it. Happy, he did it. The irony is you may recall in the beginning when this started there were folks like me and others calling for him to make sure that he contacts Xi, he get engaged and send people to — our experts to China to find out at the source what was happening. There was a federal employee that worked for the president in China to watch this and either got fired or quit. Not sure how it happened. At the time, he was out there, praising how things were going. China was doing all these wonderful things and everything was going on, but we didn’t know what was happening precisely. Now all of a sudden, he is being tough on China. He is making sure — now he is being soft on his xenophobia in the past so I just — I just can’t figure the guy. I don’t know.

"On March 24, 2020, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf (D) augmented his list of “life-sustaining” businesses to include gun dealers, allowing them to remain open as long as they adhere to certain restrictions. The new language was added under Trade, Transportation, & Utilities, in the subsection Sporting Goods, Hobby, Book, & Music Stores. It says: Firearms dealers may operate physical businesses on a limited basis to complete only the portions of a sale/transfer that must be conducted in-person under the law, subject to the following restrictions: 1) all such sale/transfers will be conducted by individual appointment during limited hours only so as to minimize social interactions and congregating of persons; 2) the dealer will comply with social distancing, sanitization of applicable area between appointments, and other mitigation measures to protect its employees and the public. The Second Amendment Foundation’s (SAF) Alan Gottlieb commented on Wolf’s decision to revisit his list of closed businesses and allow gun stores to remain open, saying, “The Governor was right to reverse himself.

"Four more states in the U.S. issued stay-at-home orders this week for non-essential workers in a bid to combat the accelerating spread of the deadly and highly contagious novel coronavirus, bringing the total number to 17, where nearly half of the American population resides. On Monday, Michigan, Indiana, Oregon, and West Virginia became the latest states to implement lockdown measures, the Daily Mail reported Tuesday. Thirteen other states have reportedly imposed similar restrictions to stem the spread of the coronavirus or COVID-19 — California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. Among those states are the top four hardest-hit by the virus — New York (25,665 cases; 210 deaths), New Jersey (2,844 cases; 27 deaths), California (2,240 cases; 41 deaths), and Washington (2,101 cases; 109 deaths), a New York Times tally showed. Florida (1,401 cases; 17 deaths), which is in the last place among the top five states with the highest number of coronavirus cases, has not imposed any “stay at home” measures. About 160 million people are living in the 17 states that have reportedly ordered 100 percent of non-essential workforces to “stay at home,” marking “the most extreme measures” in the United States “to date,” the Daily Mail pointed out. That means nearly half of the U.S. population (328 million) is in lockdown. Daily Mail appears to have miscounted the total number of states with lockdown measures listed in its report, placing the number at 14 in the headline. The severity of the rules differ state by state, but overall businesses that provide essential goods and services, like grocery stores and pharmacies, are allowed to continue operating. Some jurisdictions in the United States, particularly New York, have announced that they are ready to impose legal penalties that range from fines to jail time for residents who ignore the anti-coronavirus restrictions. New York is home to the most cases of the virus in the United States and about five percent of those across the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 44,183 cases and 544 deaths across all 50 states, the nation’s capital, and U.S. territories as of noon on Tuesday. Citing a substantial acceleration in infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that the U.S. could potentially become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China. While some governors in the states that have issued lockdown rules told residents to prepare for weeks of restrictions, it is unclear how long the measures will be in place. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted to open the American economy by Easter before the cure becomes worse than the disease.

"President Trump is calling for Republicans and Democrats to unite behind his American independence agenda to defeat the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. During a Tuesday press conference, Trump detailed the “critical” need for American independence in manufacturing, the energy sector, and territorially at the nation’s borders to stop the coronavirus crisis: We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival. I think we’ve learned a lot. This crisis has underscored just how critical it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector. For three years, we’ve embarked on a great national project to secure our immigration system and bring back our manufacturing jobs. We’ve brought back many jobs, record numbers of jobs, and this really shows, this experience shows how important borders are. Without borders, you don’t have a nation. [Emphasis added] Trump said his agenda to fighting the coronavirus and lifting the United States out of a state of globalist dependency includes manufacturing pharmaceuticals and essential supplies and equipment in America, made by American workers. “Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies for American hospitals, and American equipment for our great American heroes,” Trump said. “Now both parties must unite to ensure America is truly an independent nation in every sense of the word.” “Energy independence, we’ve established it, something incredible we’ve established … manufacturing independence, economic independence, and territorial independence enforced by strong, sovereign borders,” Trump continued: America will never be a supplicate nation. We will be a proud, prosperous, and self-reliant nation. We will embrace commerce with all but will be dependent on none. Above all, we know the best thing for our economy and the world right now is a very, very powerful victory over the virus. [Emphasis added] On immigration, Trump has invoked a federal statute to close the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders to foreign migrants to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Trump has also implemented travel bans on China, Iran, and Europe to prevent travel-related infections in the U.S. Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has worked closely with private industry to ramp up domestic production of necessary supplies and equipment — including one deal with 3M to produce 35 million respirator masks a month at its South Dakota manufacturing plant. The results of U.S. free trade with China have meant that the U.S. currently depends on China to produce an estimated 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that are needed to manufacture drugs in the U.S. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was enacted and China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), nearly five million American manufacturing jobs have been eliminated from the American economy — 3.4 million of which are due to U.S. free trade with China. The mass elimination of working- and middle-class jobs and depressed U.S. wages due to NAFTA and China’s entering the WTO have coincided with a 600 percent increase in trade deficits.

"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Monday that abortions should be be performed in the state unless the mother’s life is in danger, as part of the effort to preserve medical resources to help Texans who are infected with the coronavirus. The number of deaths in the state from the virus numbered nine, according to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, on Tuesday. Paxton’s announcement came one day after Gov. Greg Abbott ordered healthcare professionals and facilities to postpone all procedures that are not deemed “medically necessary.” The order will be in place until April 21. “No one is exempt from the governor’s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,” the statement from Paxton’s office reads. “Those who violate the governor’s order will be met with the full force of the law.” Violators of the order could face a $1,000 fine or up to 180 days in jail. The Texas Tribune reported on the development and the objection from the nation’s largest abortion provider, which, according to Planned Parenthood’s latest annual report, numbered 345,672: Late last week, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost sent letters to abortion clinics demanding they cease operations and instead send medical supplies to health care workers fighting the coronavirus. Ohio abortion clinics pushed back. Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region said in a statement that it would follow the state’s order on personal protective equipment but continue some procedures. Planned Parenthood’s statement reads: Planned Parenthood’s top priority is ensuring that every person can continue accessing essential health care, including abortion. Under that order, Planned Parenthood can still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion, and our health centers continue to provide services that our patients depend on. “Advocacy group Texas Freedom Network released a statement condemning the attorney general’s actions. Reproductive health care is essential, president Kathy Miller said,” the Tribune reported. “There are many reasons women decide to have an abortion in the already limited time window state law allows, and a delay means denying them the constitutional right to make those decisions in a safe, timely manner with the help of their doctors,” Miller said in the statement. Meanwhile, pro-lifers said these restrictions protect more than the unborn. John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, said in the Tribune report that the abortion industry needs to focus on supporting essential healthcare providers at a critical time for the state. “Continuing elective procedures is a public health threat,” Seago said.  Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",Texas Officials Halt Medically Unnecessary Abortions During Coronavirus,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/texas-officials-halt-medically-unnecessary-abortions-during-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"A Kentucky resident has tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus after attending a “coronavirus party,” Gov. Andy Beshear (D) announced on Tuesday. Beshear said at a press briefing that the individual recently attended a gathering of adults in their 20s but stopped short of naming which country they are from. “I guess thinking they were invincible flaunting the mass gathering prohibition,” Beshear judged. “This is something that no one should be doing across the commonwealth. “We all owe each other a duty to protect each other,” the governor added. “And we simply can’t have folks that are doing things like this.” As of Tuesday, Kentucky has confirmed 163 cases of the illness, and four people have died. “This is the part where I, the person that tells everybody to be calm, have to remain calm myself,” the governor continued. “Because anyone who goes to something like this may think that they are indestructible, but it’s someone else’s loved one that they are going to hurt.” “We are battling for the health and even the lives of our parents and our grandparents,” he added. “Don’t be so callous as to intentionally go to something and expose yourself to something that can kill other people. We ought to be much better than that.” The state is scheduled to receive $1.6 million in federal funds to fight the outbreak. “In response to the coronavirus, I was proud to lead bipartisan efforts as Senate Majority Leader to deliver urgent funding for community health centers nationwide, including $1.6 million to Kentucky,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said in a statement.“Community health centers are an essential resource for quality, primary care in many rural areas of Kentucky.

"The Democrat PAC Priorities USA Action, which has ties to dark money left-wing groups, is launching a $6 million anti-Trump ad blitz focusing on President Trump’s handling of the health and economic crises caused by the Chinese coronavirus. Priorities USA Action is spending millions on negative ads on the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The ads are slated to appear in four key swing states — Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan — on Tuesday. One of the ads spreads the fake news narrative that the president called the virus itself a “hoax” and features a variety of cherry-picked remarks made by the president as the outbreak began to materialize in the United States. According to Politico, the $6 million ad blitz is part of a greater $150 million effort from Priorities USA “to run ads slamming Trump on health care in Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July.” This, however, is far from the first effort of far-left Democrats to use the coronavirus outbreak as a political weapon against the president. Some of the opposition can be traced to dark money groups and their concerted effort to see Trump ousted in November. The Democrat PAC Pacronym, which is affiliated with the nonprofit group Acronym, announced this month that it would also drop $5 million on negative ads targeting the president’s response to the crisis. The “liberal dark money group” New Venture Fund, which is part of the larger group Arabella Advisors, is connected to several of these efforts. As Breitbart News detailed: Acronym is funded by the “liberal dark money group” New Venture Fund, which is “part of a larger group called Arabella Advisors, which provides philanthropic guidance and manages four nonprofits,” according to the nonpartisan ethics watchdog group Americans for Public Trust. Those also include the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, and Hopewell Fund. The financial web, however, goes far beyond those connections. The political group American Bridge, which was founded by David Brock — a close ally of the Clintons and founder of Media Matters for America — is also involved in the overarching efforts to spread misinformation on President Trump’s response to the coronavirus and further politicize the crisis. “American Bridge’s network of nonprofits received funding in 2018 from New Venture Fund, as well as another Arabella group called Sixteen Thirty Fund,” Americans for Public Trust reports. According to Influence Watch, a watchdog project of the investigative think tank Capital Research Center, Priorities USA also has ties to the dark money liberal group, New Venture Fund: Priorities USA Foundation is the 501(c)(3) arm of the left-of-center advocacy group Priorities of USA Action, which is affiliated with Priorities USA, a major Super PAC that supports Democratic Party candidates. In its first year of operation (2017), the group gave $50,000 to the New Venture Fund, a major left-wing funder managed by the consulting firm Arabella Advisors, with a grant description indicating the money was to be gifted to America Votes, a left-wing 501(c)(4) voter engagement group. [1] New Venture Fund gave more than $700,000 to America Votes in 2017, according to its 2017 tax returns. [2] Despite the increasing attacks, Trump has maintained an optimistic and hopeful tone, even telling Fox News’s Bill Hemmer on Tuesday that he hopes to see the economy reopened by Easter.",Democrat PAC with Ties to Dark Money Groups Spending $6 Million on Anti-Trump Coronavirus Ads,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/democrat-pac-with-ties-to-dark-money-groups-spending-6-million-on-anti-trump-coronavirus-ads/,Breitbart

President Donald Trump, Vice President Pence, Dr. Deborah Birx, and Dr. Anthony Fauci appeared in the White House briefing room on Tuesday evening to discuss the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. “It’s a very serious situation, Dr. Fauci said. “They’ve suffered terribly through no fault of their own.” New York residents have been leaving for Florida, North Carolina, and Long Island to escape the disease, prompting officials to express concerns about spread. Fauci said that although it was “understandable” that New Yorkers were leaving town, they should self-isolate for two weeks. “We don’t want that to be another seeding point to the rest of the country, wherever they go,” he said. Dr. Birx agreed. “Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread to others,” she said. Birx called the statistics of infected people from the New York area “disturbing,” citing one per 1,000 infected. “That’s about eight to ten times more than in other areas,” Brix said.

"Democrat congressional candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar deleted a tweet Tuesday in which he had complained about pork projects in the stimulus bill proposed Monday by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Campa-Najjar recently qualified for the November general election in the heavily Republican 50th congressional district against retired Rep. Darrell Issa (R), who is running for the seat recently vacated by Rep. Duncan Hunter. Hunter defeated Campa-Najjar in 2018, even while under federal indictment for corruption, after it emerged that Campa-Najjar is the grandson of a notorious Palestinian terrorist behind the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich. Campa-Najjar dissociated himself from his grandfather’s terrorist actions in 2018, but Breitbart News found that he had praised his grandfather in 2015 as a “legend.” In the 2020 race, Campa-Najjar is attempting to pitch himself to the district’s conservative electorate. He praised President Donald Trump on Tuesday, for example, for supporting a ban on stock buybacks for companies receiving emergency relief funds currently under consideration in Congress. But after Campa-Najjar singled out a $35 million grant in Pelosi’s proposal to assist the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., he took the tweet down without explanation. And Issa called him out: .@ACampaNajjar almost had the courage to stand up to his own party, but then deleted this tweet. Must have received a call from @SpeakerPelosi. pic.twitter.com/SFAuSxkiO8 — Darrell Issa (@DarrellIssa) March 24, 2020  Campa-Najjar later posted a toned-down version of the same criticism, adding a suggestion about “gig workers”: Instead of itemizing $35 million to the Kennedy Center when it’s closed until May 10th, the House bill should be helping provide relief to gig workers (like drivers) who have zero protections. Let’s give Kennedy Center employees the same aid we’re giving every worker. pic.twitter.com/LvAgVGZCBI — Ammar Campa-Najjar (@ACampaNajjar) March 24, 2020  He also appeared to respond on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, accusing Issa of downplaying the coronavirus in past fundraising appeals: You said “the left is manufacturing crisis“ over “outbreak of viruses” @DarrellIssa.

"Congressional Democrats are seizing on the Coronavirus crisis to finally lay longstanding progressive election reform goals into federal standards in time for the 2020 presidential election. Though not a total federal takeover, various bill elements empower third-party groups to enforce new requirements against states if the Trump Justice Department cannot or will not enforce reforms like mail ballot harvesting. The Pelosi Coronavirus aid package contains five primary sections that have Republican lawmakers up in arms. Mandated allowance of ballot harvesting is garnering the most attention with respect to changes in actual voting. Current state laws vary widely on the practice. Twenty-seven states allow an absentee voter to designate an agent to return their ballot—only 12 of these place limitations on the number of ballots a single person can return on behalf of others. Even within those dozen, ballot return limits vary, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Another nine states (including battlegrounds like North Carolina and Michigan) limit agency to only family members. Another 13 states (like Colorado and Georgia) are silent on the question. The Pelosi language overrides all local laws and removes any ballot return limits. The risks for error in mail balloting are heightened in areas of the country under disaster or emergency declarations. The bill requires that absentee ballots be sent to all registrants on file in those jurisdictions automatically—regardless of whether the voter roll is loaded with outdated entries. The bill does not carve an exception for “inactive” registrants, which are designated by counties as having outdated or incorrect contact information on file and have been consecutively absent from the polls for years. Deceased registrants are sometimes in this category because next-of-kin fail to notify officials of the death. The second blockbuster reform mandates that prospective voters be able to register on Election Day within the polling place. Roughly 21 states have some similar measure of same-day registration already on the books. But as the NCLS notes, new adopters spend years building out their systems—not a few months. This section contains two more alarming aspects: states are limited against asking for personal identifying information like full Social Security numbers; and cannot make applicants prove eligibility beyond an attestation that they are legally able to vote. The bill provides no leeway for states to withhold normal counting of a ballot until eligibility is fully verified, like even California requires. The Pelosi bill also sets uniform standards on polling places. Sites will need to be walkable from public transit stops in addition to other vaguely worded requirements. Provisional ballots must also be counted no matter where they are cast in a state—so long as the person was otherwise eligible. Despite vague language and unprecedented deadlines to establish systems within months instead of years, proponents of the transformative changes are armed with federal litigation rights where they see fit. Private rights of action are attached throughout the bill to ensure that a state falling behind a mandate or refusing to follow outright can get hauled before a judge by the aggrieved party. During the early hours of the unveiling, several left-wing groups with established histories of backing the reforms began to signal broad support. Before the contents of the Pelosi bill began to widely circulate, more than 150 left-leaning nonprofits issued a demand letter for the reforms—all of which are now before Congress. We stand w/ 150+ organizations in demanding that Congress provide real relief for states to implement reforms that will safeguard democracy given the public health crisis. Instead of corporate bailouts, we need a focus on vulnerable communities and our civil rights. #COVID pic.twitter.com/pLuXNcTXG2 — Lawyers’ Committee ☎️866-OUR-VOTE (@LawyersComm) March 23, 2020  Groups like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, MALDEF, and more signing on to the letter are regulars in reshaping election laws within courts and legislatures away from traditional federalist models.

"President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force will host a press briefing at the White House on Tuesday, scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EST. The president and his team continue to talk about the fight to contain the spread of the virus as well as support Americans suffering the economic effects of the global pandemic. The Senate still has yet to reach a deal, as Democrats continue stalling a major economic rescue bill for Americans, small businesses, and select industries hit hardest by the coronavirus crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over 2,000 points on Tuesday after President Donald Trump predicted the country would likely be ready to open for business by Easter, April 12. It was the largest single gain for the Dow since 1933. Many establishment reporters, however, do not share the president’s optimism, openly accusing the president of not relying on the advice from doctors to make his predictions. Trump has said he will listen to the doctors and other experts but will ultimately make the final decisions about the country and the economy. “It’s not built to shut down,” Trump said on Tuesday. “Our people are full of vim and vigor and energy. They don’t want to be locked in a house or an apartment or some space.” President Trump has hosted daily press conferences to answer questions from reporters, citing the importance of transparency to the American people. “We take a lot of questions from you,” Trump said to reporters on Monday. “Unfortunately, some of them are repetitive and some of them are fantastic questions.”  ",Watch Live: President Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force Speaks to the Press,2020-03-24,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/watch-live-president-trumps-coronavirus-task-force-speaks-to-the-press-5/,Breitbart

Trump’s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge.

I consider it a privilege to be able to wear the uniform of the United States Navy, and this is exactly what we train for,” she said in an interview with Breitbart News on Monday evening. “This is exactly why I’ve stayed in the Reserves for 34 years — having this ability to be able to bring the skills that I’ve been given for the greater good and our community and in this case our entire nation,” she added. She announced Monday that she is deploying aboard a U.S. Navy hospital ship — likely the USNS Comfort, which is expected to deploy to New York City to help treat non-coronavirus patients so that civilian hospitals can handle the influx of coronavirus patients. Blankenbeker serves in the U.S. Navy Reserve as an operating room nurse. As a captain, she also can serve in management and leadership roles aboard the ship. “I’ll wait and see to get on the ship to see where the need is,” she said. She said beginning last week, her command began calling and asking questions, to get a sense of who could staff the 1,000-bed hospital ships, after President Trump directed the Navy to deploy the ships. All those willing and able were put on a volunteer list. “I spent my entire life running toward the fight. That’s what we do and that’s what we train to do,” she said. She said her family is less worried about her deploying in the coronavirus response effort than her previous deployments, which include Afghanistan and Desert Storm. “They’re actually not as worked up this time, because there will be no bombs coming our way,” she said. She said while she’s on the ship, her “only focus” will be supporting the U.S. Navy and supporting the mission. “I will put 100 percent focus on taking care of our patients that come on that ship, and supporting my shipmates and the mission. So for me, I will not be doing anything actively on my campaign,” she said. However, she said her campaign team will continue to work on her behalf, and work with community leaders and constituents to help respond to the coronavirus crisis. “When our community comes together, we can get through anything, and this crisis is no different,” she said. “I’m very confident that we’re going to rise above this and thrive as a nation, and I’m just proud and honored to be part of helping us get to that success quickly.” Blankenbeker is running against Democrat incumbent Rep.

"The government has told city dwellers to not break travel restrictions by going to their second homes, with coastal and rural communities becoming increasingly frustrated at being overrun by wealthy coronavirus refugees. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government laid out that Britons should remain in their “primary residence”, and not travel to their “second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar”. The guidance explained: “Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.” Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove gave a stern warning to second-home owners on Sky News on Tuesday, saying in no uncertain terms should they be risking “spreading the virus across the country and nor should they risk putting a strain on the NHS in other parts of the country. The advice is clear: stay at home.” However, The Times reports that second-homers from London continue to flood into rural and coastal areas, including to Wales, Cornwall, Suffolk, Norfolk, and Scotland, despite the travel restrictions. This has led to many locals calling for tighter restrictions to keep them safe. Twenty-seven miles outside of the popular tourist destination of Conwy, one resident had strung a banner under a road sign reading: “Wales is closed.” The town’s tourism board is also urging visitors to stay away, with their website banner reading: “Visit Conwy. Later.”  The website continued: “Please do not visit Wales at this time and avoid all unnecessary travel within Wales. Following these guidelines will save lives. We look forward to welcoming you back in future; but for now, let’s all #staysafe.” Welsh doctor Eilir Hughes told the BBC last week that an increased number of second-home owners returning to Gwynedd was putting pressure on local healthcare services, saying: “It really does place a great strain on our infrastructure and our services.” Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP Liz Saville Roberts also said last week that she was “extremely concerned” at reports of a substantial increase in the population of areas in her constituency which she put down to holiday homeowners.

"The Chinese Communist Party is wilfully denying the world vital information it needs to stem the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo charged on Tuesday night. Speaking during an exchange with the Washington Watch radio program, Pompeo repeated previous charges Beijing’s delay in sharing information about the virus had created risks to the global community and this had “truly put thousands of lives at risk.” He said China’s handling of the crisis exemplified the single-party Communist state’s authoritarian and nationalist tendencies. “My concern is that this cover-up, this disinformation that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in, is still denying the world the information it needs so that we can prevent further cases or something like this from recurring again,” he added, according to Reuters. Pompeo also accused Iran and Russia of waging their own distinct disinformation campaigns. “The disinformation campaign from Russia and Iran as well as China continues,” he said. “They’re talking about it coming from the U.S. Army and they’re saying maybe it began in Italy, all things to deflect responsibility.” This is not the first time Pompeo has publicly decried China’s response to the epidemic and accused the communists of being economical with the truth. As Breitbart News reported, last week hit directly at the Chinese Communist Party for what he described as a “disinformation campaign” on the coronavirus. Pompeo explained how the Chinese government had stood in the way of many efforts by the global community to get an early grasp on the pandemic. He said: We have had an incredibly difficult time getting professional medical people in. You’ll recall early on, we offered to have America’s finest experts to travel there to assist them, to assist the World Health Organization. We weren’t permitted in. These are the kinds of things that the Chinese Communist Party has done that had put the world and the world’s people at risk. They haven’t been sufficiently transparent, and the risk, Sean, that you find, where if we don’t get this right, if we don’t get to the bottom of this, is this could — this could be something that’s repeatable, maybe not in this form, maybe not on this way, but transparency matters. Pompeo on Tuesday did not shy away from outling the consequences down the track for China and its intransigence. “The time will come for recriminations,” he said, but added it was important for the world to know now how best to stem the global threat. “This is an ongoing global crisis, and we need to make sure that every country today is being transparent, sharing what’s really going on, so that the global community, the global health care, infectious disease community can begin to work on this in a holistic way.” Pompeo hinted “very important decisions” would have to be made in future about how the U.S.-China relationship progressed. He said global supply-chain impacts in the United States were due to companies “operating their supply chains out of China but not here in the United States.” For its part, China has always rejected any criticism of its handling of the matter. As Breitbart News reported, the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Communist Party’s propaganda arms erupted in rage earlier this month when Pompeo repeatedly used the term “Wuhan virus” to refer to the malady. The Global Times, a Chinese communist propaganda outlet, railed against Pompeo for his remarks, calling them, among other insults, “morally irresponsible,” “ridiculous,” and “rude.” “As the chief U.S. diplomat, Pompeo insisted on speaking of the ‘Wuhan virus’ despite the opposition of WHO and international public opinion, in an attempt to arouse resentment among those affected countries against China,” the Global Times asserted. “Pompeo’s move not only exposes malicious U.S. intentions toward China without regard to common sense, but also hits a new low in his personal conduct.”",Pompeo: Chinese Communist Party Denying World Vital Coronavirus Information,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/25/pompeo-chinese-communist-party-denying-world-vital-coronavirus-information/,Breitbart
"Nevada’s Democrat Gov. Steve Sisolak signed an order Tuesday outlawing the use of antimalarial drugs for sufferers of the coronavirus. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the “governor’s order prohibits the prescribing and dispensing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for a COVID-19 diagnosis[.]” “At this point in time, there is no known cure for COVID-19 and we must not withhold these drugs from those who need them,” the governor said in his statement. “The best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home for Nevada, not to stockpile these drugs.” Sisolak said he signed the emergency order after receiving a request from the Pharmacy Board, which claims the effectiveness of these drugs to treat the Chinese virus has “not been established,” and that “an emergency exists due to the hoarding and stockpiling” of these antimalaria drugs: chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. This order makes no sense, especially in a world where another Democrat governor, Andrew Cuomo of New York, has ordered trials of the malaria drug. Saying he agrees with the president, Cuomo announced last week: “We’re also implementing the trial drug:” We have secured 70,000 hydrocloroquin; 10,000 zithromax from the federal government. I want to thank the FDA for moving very expeditiously to get us this supply. The President ordered the FDA to move and the FDA moved. We’re going to get the supply and the trial will start this Tuesday. The President is optimistic about these drugs and we are all optimistic that it could work. I’ve spoken with a number of health officials and there is a good basis to believe that they could work. Some health officials point to Africa, which has a very low infection rate and there’s a theory that because they’re taking these anti-malaria drugs in Africa, it may actually be one of the reasons why the infection rate is low in Africa. We don’t know, but let’s find out and let’s find out quickly. And I agree with the President on that and we’re going to start and we’re going to start Tuesday. While Sisolak is correct that the FDA has not approved the drug for coronavirus sufferers, the FDA has approved the drug for a number of other ailments, which means it is safe for human consumption — as long you consult with your doctor and follow the prescription orders. In other words, what you don’t want to do is look for something that might have hydroxychloroquine in it and gobble it down, like some poor fool did this week with his fish tank cleaner. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support giving these drugs a try… This includes studies… Again, we’re a long way from FDA approval through clinical trials,  and the Africa correlation Cuomo spoke of might indeed have nothing to do with the malaria drug and have everything to do with Africa’s heat. Scientists believe the Chinese virus doesn’t fare well in warm weather. Nonetheless, if someone I loved was in throes of the Wuhan virus and I lived in Nevada and was not allowed to try everything reasonable to save this person, I’d be furious. And this malaria drug *is* reasonable. What’s more, how can there be hoarding going on in Nevada when 1) you can only acquire this drug through a prescription, and 2) there are only around 300 coronavirus sufferers throughout the entire state? As far as I know, the only “hoarding” going on is by those who can write a prescription to themselves, meaning doctors and the like. But the shortage is a worldwide shortage, and for obvious reasons: countries all over the world want  the drug to help their own coronavirus sufferers. It would make perfect sense for Sisolak to outlaw doctors prescribing these drugs as a preemptive prescription, as a “just in case” prescription. But to deny it to those already suffering with the coronavirus is a gross violation of human rights, and an infringement of the relationship between patient and doctor.

"Just like in war, the great coronavirus plague is bringing out the best in people and the worst in people. So far, the petty tyrants, the tell-tales, the ignoramuses, the rule-takers and the finger-pointers are having a field day; the more original, clear-eyed thinkers meanwhile, are having to take care about what they say for fear of being judged and found wanting by the self-righteous mob. Already the battle lines are starting to make themselves clear. There are, roughly speaking, two opposing camps.  “I for one welcome our new insect overlords”. This contains the control freaks; the authoritarians; the snitches; the panickers; the killjoys; the ‘trust the experts’; the curtain-twitchers; the leftists; and the catastrophists. The Awkward Squad. This contains the liberty-lovers; the libertines; the grand strategists; the rebels; the sceptics; the mavericks; the contrarians; the misfits; the deplorables. Obviously it’s not quite as simple as that. Though I’m mainly in the Awkward Squad camp, I’ve certainly had my headless chicken moments. (At one point, I even went so far as to retweet approvingly a tweet from our current Hysteric In Chief Piers Morgan). Equally, I know that there are plenty of people I respect who are currently in the “I for one welcome our new insect overlords” camp. This is not because they are stupid or are dangerous leftists with fascistic tendencies or are invertebrates who like being walked all over by the authorities, but simply because they are understandably scared, inadequately informed and haven’t (yet) seen the bigger picture. Generally, though, what we’re seeing writ large in this pandemic is a clash between two ideological positions — one essentially authoritarian, one more or less libertarian. I think this conflict is going to get more bitter and nasty as the pandemic progresses. We’ve already had a taste of it in the monstering — by the “I for one welcome our new insect overlords” camp — of Peter Hitchens. Hitchens, whom I interviewed recently on the Delingpod, is perhaps Britain’s bravest and most original journalist because he speaks his mind without fear or favour and really doesn’t care whether you like him or not. At the weekend, he wrote a characteristically forthright piece for the Mail on Sunday about the Boris Johnson administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. I highly recommend you read it. Hitchens talks a lot of sense. And so here I am, asking bluntly – is the closedown of the country the right answer to the coronavirus? I’ll be accused of undermining the NHS and threatening public health and all kinds of other conformist rubbish. But I ask you to join me, because if we have this wrong we have a great deal to lose. I don’t just address this plea to my readers. I think my fellow journalists should ask the same questions. I think MPs of all parties should ask them when they are urged tomorrow to pass into law a frightening series of restrictions on ancient liberties and vast increases in police and state powers. and The incessant coverage of health scares and supermarket panics has obscured the dire news coming each hour from the stock markets and the money exchanges. The wealth that should pay our pensions is shrivelling as share values fade and fall. The pound sterling has lost a huge part of its value. Governments all over the world are resorting to risky, frantic measures which make Jeremy Corbyn’s magic money tree look like sober, sound finance. Much of this has been made far worse by the general shutdown of the planet on the pretext of the coronavirus scare. However bad this virus is (and I will come to that), the feverish panic on the world’s trading floors is at least as bad. And then there is the Johnson Government’s stumbling retreat from reason into fear. At first, Mr Johnson was true to himself and resisted wild demands to close down the country. But bit by bit he gave in. Hitchens was certainly right in his prediction about how his piece would be greeted. This reaction is fairly typical of the response he has had from the angry Twitter mob. What a load – thanks for spreading the dog tripe and killing a few extra Dr & Nurses! #responsible — Victoria Familicide (@VFamilicide) March 23, 2020  Then there’s this spittle-flecked diatribe from the former BBC journalist (humiliated in Tommy Robinson’s Panodrama sting) John Sweeney. Sweeney was so incensed that Hitchens had an opinion different from his own that he accused Hitchens of lying and demanded the Mail On Sunday no longer publish him. #PanicDiary March 22 @ClarkeMicah Peter Hitchens writes in Mail On Sunday that #coronavirus shutdown is based on ""mere speculation"". That is a lie. Here I ask Mail On Sunday to stop publishing dangerous nonsense of Death's Useful Idiot. Full video here: https://t.co/ehGC5Ci4RG pic.twitter.com/o2E6sAswkQ — John Sweeney (@johnsweeneyroar) March 22, 2020  Almost nobody in the “I for one welcome our insect overlords” camp has been capable of challenging with any intelligence Hitchens’s argument. Instead, they’ve resorted to the tired old tactics of the regressive left — either accusing him of dishonesty, bad faith and ignorance or simply trying to close him down with emotive bullying by invoking all the people who are inevitably going to die and implying that when they do die it will somehow be Hitchens’s fault. Can you imagine how much worse this is going to get as the bodies pile up in the hospitals — as they almost certainly will. In roughly a fortnight’s time, Britain will be where Italy is today and the news will be chock full of stories about the heart-rending triage decisions that will have to be made by overstretched consultants and knackered nurses in inadequate protective clothing as to which desperately ill patients will be granted a place on the ventilator and which will reluctantly be left to die. It will be carnage. Horrific. Like something from the front line of a war zone, only happening in our city hospitals. And there is likely little that can be done to stop it at this stage because those fatalities have already been baked in: the infected will just be beginning their grim viral journey round about now and will be entering the hospitalisation stage in roughly a fortnight. This is what happens when you have a poorly structured health care system with virtually no spare capacity. This is what happens during pandemics. Yet large elements of the public – whipped up into a frenzy of hysteria by a mainstream media hungry for drama, tragedy and novelty — will react as though none of this was foreseeable, let alone inevitable. They will demand even stronger government reaction — more rules, more punishments, more authoritarianism — in order to assuage their sense of impotence and to satisfy their inner dictator. They will also cast around desperately for scapegoats to blame — be it people they’ve spotted breaking the rules (maybe going out for a walk more than once, or standing too close to someone in a supermarket) or columnists who say stuff they’re not yet ready to hear. The overreaction to the coronavirus pandemic will cause far more long term damage to our culture, our economy and our civilisation than anything the disease manages to achieve. If you think this way, don’t worry, you are not alone. Toby Young and I discuss it on our latest London Calling podcast. (Toby is so robust that I temporarily have to rescind his cuck card).  I also discuss it on the latest episode of the Truth Trade podcast with Sven Hughes. (Sven was so worried about my outspokenness he asked whether I wanted to edit it out. I said ‘No.’). Richard North has been writing some excellent stuff at EU Referendum. Then there’s this superb take from Hector Drummond. As I think I may have said to Sven Hughes, there are penalties for being right too far in advance of everyone else. But one day those of us who kept their heads when all about were losing theirs — and blaming it on us — will be vindicated.

"The global coronavirus pandemic did not start in China, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party declared Tuesday, claiming support from both the United Nations (U.N.) and World Health Organization (WHO) in rejecting “hurtful” U.S. allegations to the contrary as “bald-faced racism and xenophobia.” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing not only does China have the full backing of the globalist organizations in denying it started the viral outbreak, the U.S. must cease and desist forthwith from challenging their assertions. He said: The Chinese side has repeated many times that some people in the U.S. have been seeking by every means to link the virus with China and stigmatize China. This was met with strong indignation and firm objection from the Chinese people. WHO and the international community explicitly oppose linking the virus with any specific country or region and reject stigmatization. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said ‘it is shameful to see increasing acts of racial discrimination and prejudice as we fight the COVID19 pandemic’ and ‘we must always fight racism and prejudice’. E.U. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said the virus knows no border and we need cooperation and multilateralism, instead of competition and recrimination, in face of the common challenge for mankind. It is not the time for countries to blame one another with terms like ‘Chinese virus’. WHO believes that we should avoid calling it ‘Chinese virus’. Now is the moment for solidarity, for respecting facts and for fighting together. Shuang went on to accuse the U.S. of “bald-faced racism and xenophobia” by its pointing to the evidence that the COVID19 virus was first discovered last year in the southern China city of Wuhan and local party members tried for six weeks to conceal the true nature of the outbreak. He said the U.S. started the argument and an entirely innocent Chinese Communist Party has been forced to reply even as it battled to defeat the virus. I want to point out that it was the U.S. side that started this argument. It was also the US that first claimed that the virus originated in China and used such terms as ‘Chinese virus’ and ‘Wuhan virus’. According to media reports, as early as March 6, Pompeo started to use ‘Wuhan virus’ in public remarks. Since then, some U.S. politicians and senior officials have been using this term to stigmatize China, causing great anger and strong opposition from the Chinese people. What I just cited are public records. There is no way for the U.S. to deny this. This is not the first time China has sought to distance itself from the deadly global pandemic, as Britbart News reported. Earlier this month the world was told it must look to China, pay attention and follow its principles in order to halt the global epidemic, the official Communist China Daily said in an editorial. Over the past few weeks, Chinese officials and state-managed social media accounts began floating theories that the coronavirus began in the United States and was brought to Wuhan by U.S. Army soldiers visiting for the Military World Games in October. Thursday’s allegations from the Chinese Foreign Ministry that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in America and was spread to China by the U.S. military was not a fluke or an example of a rogue spokesman running his mouth. https://t.co/1Jt5KSCYpo — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 14, 2020  Last week  a major Chinese Communist Party paper, the Global Times, stated again – without evidence – the virus might have been developed in the U.S. Army laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, before being secretly released to harm an innocent and entirely helpless mainland Chinese populace.",China Is Innocent: Says U.N. and World Health Organization Reject Claim it Launched Coronavirus Pandemic,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/25/china-is-innocent-says-u-n-and-world-health-organization-reject-claim-it-launched-coronavirus-pandemic/,Breitbart
"The Chinese Communist Party is wilfully denying the world vital information it needs to stem the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo charged on Tuesday night. Speaking during an exchange with the Washington Watch radio program, Pompeo repeated previous charges Beijing’s delay in sharing information about the virus had created risks to the global community and this had “truly put thousands of lives at risk.” He said China’s handling of the crisis exemplified the single-party Communist state’s authoritarian and nationalist tendencies. “My concern is that this cover-up, this disinformation that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in, is still denying the world the information it needs so that we can prevent further cases or something like this from recurring again,” he added, according to Reuters. Pompeo also accused Iran and Russia of waging their own distinct disinformation campaigns. “The disinformation campaign from Russia and Iran as well as China continues,” he said. “They’re talking about it coming from the U.S. Army and they’re saying maybe it began in Italy, all things to deflect responsibility.” This is not the first time Pompeo has publicly decried China’s response to the epidemic and accused the communists of being economical with the truth. As Breitbart News reported, last week hit directly at the Chinese Communist Party for what he described as a “disinformation campaign” on the coronavirus. Pompeo explained how the Chinese government had stood in the way of many efforts by the global community to get an early grasp on the pandemic. He said: We have had an incredibly difficult time getting professional medical people in. You’ll recall early on, we offered to have America’s finest experts to travel there to assist them, to assist the World Health Organization. We weren’t permitted in. These are the kinds of things that the Chinese Communist Party has done that had put the world and the world’s people at risk. They haven’t been sufficiently transparent, and the risk, Sean, that you find, where if we don’t get this right, if we don’t get to the bottom of this, is this could — this could be something that’s repeatable, maybe not in this form, maybe not on this way, but transparency matters.

"The City of Los Angeles is proceeding with plans announced last week by Mayor Eric Garcetti to move thousands of homeless residents to recreation centers in residential communities during the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, in New York, 30 residents of homeless shelters have tested positive for coronavirus, after a single case was reported last week, according to the New York Post, which notes that one sick person was sent from a hospital to a shelter. The Post reports: The number of homeless individuals in New York City’s crammed shelter system infected with the coronavirus exploded to 30 from just a single case reported last week – with one being referred from the equally stressed public hospital network. One of the homeless people who tested positive was sent to a shelter by a public hospital because the person exhibited only mild symptoms and was not deemed sick enough to be admitted, a Department of Homeless official said. One of the reasons behind L.A.’s policy is that local officials want to reduce crowding in existing shelters, creating “social distance” and reducing opportunities for coronavirus to spread inside. But as Breitbart News reported earlier this week, L.A. is not just relocating residents of existing shelters. It is also picking up new homeless residents from the streets, who are driven to the recreation shelters in shuttle buses. Those who are picked up are asked a set of “screening questions” and subjected to a temperature check before being admitted to the recreation centers. Inside the shelters — which Breitbart News was not permitted to photograph — beds are spaced six feet apart. Some advocates for the homeless support Garcetti’s plan, thankful that something is finally being done to move people off the streets of L.A., where the homeless population has exploded to roughly 60,000. But others (including some homeless people) worry that moving the homeless into centers with hundreds of beds will expose them — inadvertently — to additional health risk. Communities are also worried about exposing locals to potentially infected people, and that the “temporary” use of recreation centers could become permanent. One suggestion — made last year, before the pandemic — would be to care for the homeless on unused federal property in the city, perhaps in emergency tents. State officials do not know how many homeless people are infected with coronavirus, the Los Angeles Times reported last week. Joel B.

"U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to repatriate 13,500 Americans stranded overseas amid the accelerating coronavirus global outbreak, a State Department official revealed on Monday. The Trump administration has already evacuated some 5,700 Americans from 17 countries, according to State. Speaking on background, the official noted the U.S. is using military aircraft, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deportation planes, and chartered flights to get some Americans home while asking others to avail themselves of commercial means to return when possible. “We are also helping private carriers increase the number of flights they have,” the official said. The window to return to the United States by commercial planes is “closing fast,” State warned. The State Department’s message to people overseas is for them to try to leave now unless they are “ready to ride out an undetermined period of time” at their current location, the official said. An estimated ten million U.S. citizens are living abroad. That figure, however, does not represent “the entire universe of people who would be seeking to return to the United States,” the official explained, adding: The people who are seeking our assistance at the moment are what we might consider the expats or tourists who are overseas temporarily. They’re the ones whose homes are here in the United States, in other words trying to come home to ride out this crisis. … We have so far seen 13,500 or so thousand U.S. citizens who have requested some form of assistance [in returning home] and registered with us. The official stopped short of saying at this point the U.S. government is confident there will be a way for every American who wants to come home to do so. “We are hearing about people who are in very remote locations in very remote parts of the world. It’s complicated,” the official noted, later adding: I’ve heard about individual people in remote areas in Peru, in Samoa, in [the] Banda [islands] … in Indonesia. So I am hesitant to give a guarantee we can move every single person. We are moving very large numbers of people, and we will continue this effort. Nevertheless, the official emphasized that State has the capacity, in general, to deal with the global crisis unfolding at the moment. “It has been a lot of hard work, and it is going to be a lot of hard work going forward, but yes, we are dealing with this. Yeah, we are devoting all of our resources to this,” the official said. State is reportedly working with DHS, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other agencies to repatriate Americans stuck overseas. The State Department stressed it is rising to meet the “unprecedented global challenge” of getting home Americans overseas impacted by the widening coronavirus outbreak. “We’re working around the clock to bring U.S. citizens who are stranded overseas back home,” the official said. “Our consular officers posted overseas, and their local employee colleagues have been working night and day to help Americans get on flights.” “There’s a 24-7 task force here in Washington supporting that effort,” the official added. Before establishing the task force last week, the U.S. evacuated over 800 people from the epicenter of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, over 300 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan,” and 1,200 out of Morocco, among others from Central America and other places. The official said: In total, to date, we have brought home more than 5,000 Americans from 17 countries, and we’re bringing home thousands more in the coming days and weeks. … We’re looking at now 16 or so flights in the next five days, and we’ve got, at this point, over 1,600 passengers identified for those flights. There’s room for more. He noted that, as of Monday, the Peruvian government had not yet given the okay for the U.S. to evacuate Americans stuck in the South American country. Regarding State’s 75,000-person workforce in over 220 locations around, the official said, there is a contingency plan in place to evacuate them if necessary, adding: If we have to charter an aircraft to bring out what we call [the] chief of mission personnel and there’s additional space available on those flights, we will make those additional seats available to private U.S. citizens seeking to depart those countries. So this is an ongoing dynamic situation as the virus spreads, and more and more posts go on authorized or ordered departure. The number of State employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus stands at “less than 30,” the official said. State is urging Americans overseas to enroll in the federal government’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. “This is how embassies communicate important health and safety information to U.S. citizens in real-time,” the official pointed out. The official also noted that Americans could get information by calling 1-888-407-4747 from within the United States and 1-202-501-4444 from overseas.","Coronavirus: U.S. Working to Repatriate 13,500 Americans Stuck Overseas",2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/25/coronavirus-u-s-working-to-repatriate-13500-americans-stuck-overseas/,Breitbart

Villanueva is the Director of Emergency Operations, which means “all FEMA requests go through him, and all National Guard requests go through him.” He said, “When we’re communicating the shelter in place or the safer at home, there’s a lot of anguish, however, the people who have to enforce it are public safety, and we were totally out of the process, we were not involved,” Villanueva defended his decision to close gun stores, by intimating that all the first-time gun buyers emerging amid the virus crisis create a perilous situation: “I’m a supporter of the 2nd amendment, I’m a gun owner myself, but now you have the mixture of people that are not formerly gun owners and you have a lot more people at home and anytime you introduce a firearm in a home, from what I understand from CDC studies, it increases fourfold the chance that someone is gonna get shot.” F’OX LA’s Bill Melugin tweeted there is an effort underway to add gun stores to Governor Gavin Newsom’s (D) “essential” business list, which would prevent the sheriff from enforcing the shut down.

"A Wisconsin-based manufacturer is pivoting from making American flags to producing masks for medical workers. “We put a lot of work into it this weekend to make the prototypes and now it’s just training the staff,” Eder Flag CEO Jody Goglio told WISN. Eder Flag is the largest manufacturer of American flags and flagpoles in the U.S., according to its website. “They’re moving a little bit slower, but that’s because we want to make sure whatever the final product is, it’s quality product. That’s most important for us.” The employee-owned company hopes its seamstresses will be able to produce tens of thousands of masks per week. Eder is partnering with Monterey Mills, which is supplying the materials. “My guess is (hospitals will) use it as an entry-level position when they’re dealing with new patients,” Monterey Mills President Dan Sinykin told the news station. “The strong advantage we have with our product is it’s machine washable, dryable and reusable. So they can use it for a patient, throw it in a bin, get it sanitized, cleaned, then they can reuse it later,” Sinykin said. Meanwhile, a California-based sportwear company is also shifting its focus to meet the needs of medical personnel. “I have to do something. I have a big factory. I can do something,” Abdul Rashid, chief operating officer of AST Sportswear told ABC 7. The company reconfigured manufacturing almost overnight. “We actually ordered 30 more machines just to make these masks. Our workers are all here, we’re trying to not lay anybody off,” sales manager Nadir Zulfiqar said. The company has 500 employees now sewing face masks. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Actor James Woods has once again landed in Twitter jail after he posted a photo allegedly showing former Florida gubernatorial candidate and CNN contributor Andrew Gillum passed out and naked in a South Beach hotel. James Woods was locked out of his account on Tuesday, according to an individual familiar with the matter. A screenshot of his suspension notice states that he violated Twitter rules against “sharing privately produced/distributed intimate media of someone without their express consent.” The rule is commonly applied to revenge porn posted on the platform. The two-time Oscar-nominated star is claiming that he was suspended because Twitter is trying to protect Andrew Gillum, who is a Democrat. “Twitter is, of course, protecting Andrew Gillum because no one should ever know how vile these Democrat scum truly are,” he said in a statement that was posted by his girlfriend, Sara Miller, on Twitter. So @RealJamesWoods has been locked out of his account again for sharing “intimate media” of a drunk, naked, puking politician.

The rising Democratic politician and CNN contributor was in the hotel room with two male companions along with bags of crystal meth, according to multiple reports. One of the companions was reportedly a male escort named Travis Dyson. Gillum, who has a wife and children, claimed to be in the Miami area for a wedding. Following the incident, he announced that he would be entering a rehab clinic. Gillum ran for governor of Florida last year but lost to Republican Ron DeSantis. Despite his loss, Gillum was widely seen as a rising star in the Democrat party. Leaked police photos from the hotel room have widely circulated online. Woods tweeted a leaked photo allegedly showing Gillum naked and unconscious on the hotel room floor amid soiled towels. James Woods has feuded with Twitter multiple times for alleged rules violations. The most prominent incident occurred in 2019 when the actor tweeted a reference to Democrats’ attempts to impeach President Donald Trump: “‘If you try to kill the King, you best not miss’ #HangThemAll.” The tweet resulted in Woods’ suspension from the social media platform.

"Appearing Tuesday on Philadelphia’s AM 990 The Answer Radio, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he would certainly prescribe Chloroquine to coronavirus-stricken patients in the wake of testimonies stating it could treat the deadly disease.

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah, of course, particularly if people have no other option. You want to give them hope. In fact, for physicians in this country, these drugs are approved drugs for other reasons. They’re anti-malaria drugs and they’re drugs against certain autoimmune diseases, like lupus. Physicians throughout the country can prescribe that in an off-label way. Which means they can write it for something it was not originally approved for. People do that all the time, and it really is an individual choice between the physician and his or her patient as to whether or not they want to do that.  Despite Fauci’s remarks, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) signed an emergency hours later order banning the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus.",Dr. Anthony Fauci: ‘Of Course’ I Would Prescribe Chloroquine to Coronavirus Patients,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/dr-anthony-fauci-of-course-i-would-prescribe-chloroquine-to-coronavirus-patients/,Breitbart
"The eco-fascists are showing their true face in the Coronavirus pandemic. Activists claiming to be from Extinction Rebellion have put up posters exulting in the loss of human life. They say: “Corona is the cure Humans are the disease.” Earth is healing. The air and water is clearing. Corona is the cure.Humans are the disease!#ClimateCrisis #CoronaCrisis #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/nYJp30WhtH — XREastMidlands (@xr_east) March 24, 2020  The official national leadership of Extinction Rebellion has since sought to distance itself from the posters, claiming that the stickers are ‘not in line with what XR believes or stands for’ and blaming ‘far right groups.’ IMPORTANT: We are aware that far right groups have put out stickers with messaging that is not in line with what XR believes or stands for.

First, the XR East Midlands Twitter account which boasted about the stunt is widely followed by XR groups around the country. If it has been a ‘far right’ disinformation operation, it appears to have fooled pretty much the entirety of the XR movement – which has repeatedly tweeted its views and seems to share many of them. There is no evidence that the XR account https://t.co/7oNFhxRg36 is fake or far right.

As high-level environmentalist organisation The Club of Rome once infamously wrote: “The Earth has a cancer. The cancer is man.” This is genuinely how many so-called environmentalists think. It dates back at least to the era of late 18th century doom monger Thomas Malthus and is evident in everything from the burblings of Sir David Attenborough (a former trustee of the Optimum Population Trust which, up until 2011, argued on its website that the world’s then-population of 6.8 billion should be reduced to a more ‘sustainable’ 5.1 billion) to the entire field of ecology (predicated on the notion that man is a detrimental presence on the planet). Here is that mode of thinking – worryingly popular among the global elite – expressed in the 1970s by one of the early enthusiasts of the green movement, the late gambler, tiger-enthusiast and casino owner John Aspinall. Some of us are now drawn to believe that a demo-catastrophe will be an eco-bonanza. In other words, a population readjustment on a planetary scale from 4,000 million to something in the nature of 200 minion would be the only possible solution for the survival of the eco-system or systems that nurtured us. Environmentalists, you may suspect, are the very last people we should be heeding in this coronavirus pandemic. Not only are they partly responsible for the misdirection of scientific resources which has left us so woefully ill-prepared for the disease – but a worrying proportion of them actually welcome this plague because they see it as Gaia’s revenge on evil mankind.",Delingpole: Eco-Fascists Claim no Link to ‘Corona Is the Cure; Humans are the Disease’ Signs,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/25/xr-eco-fascists-corona-is-the-cure-humans-are-the-disease/,Breitbart
"Serial loser Hillary Clinton is accused of plagiarizing an anti-Trump joke from HBO’s Bill Maher. On Monday, the two-time presidential whiffer tweeted, “Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse.” Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 24, 2020  The joke obviously refers to Donald Trump and that fake news moment of 2017 when the corrupt media claimed the president looked directly into the sun during an eclipse. Even the far-left Boston Globe was forced to concede that “videos showed that Trump wasn’t as cavalier as the still images made it seem: He looked up for a brief moment with his naked eyes beforehand in what appeared to be a joking manner before putting on his glasses.” Anyway, regardless of the truth, a meme was born, which Bill Maher took advantage of a couple weeks ago, with this joke…. “Trump said he had a hunch that the virus wasn’t as bad as the World Health Organization says,” Maher tweeted on March 7. “So on the one side, you have the World Health Organization. On the other side, you have a guy who stared at an eclipse.” Trump said he had a hunch that the virus wasn't as bad as the World Health Organization says. So on the one side, you have the World Health Organization. On the other side, you have a guy who stared at an eclipse. #TrumpHunch #Covid19 pic.twitter.com/LYhJLN3NxU — Bill Maher (@billmaher) March 7, 2020  At the risk of entering the arena of pedantry, once again we must pause to do a little fact checking. Trump was actually correct about the World Health Organization, which had been running around with the claim the coronavirus fatality rate is 3.4 percent. Thankfully, it’s much lower, around one percent, maybe less, but still, from what we now know, many times for lethal than the flu. Regardless, Maher’s joke is a good one. Good jokes exaggerate the truth, and while I didn’t see Maher’s tweet, I did see Hillary’s, and I did laugh and was impressed by her cleverness … until I learned she plagiarized it. According to Twitchy, National Review’s Kyle Smith was the first to bust Hillary, but only after the former first lady’s Blue Checkmark lapdogs bowed to her comedic genius: Love you so much. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) March 24, 2020  Oh my god, I didn’t think this was real when I saw it go viral. Hahaha! I love you, madam president. — Dana Goldberg (@DGComedy) March 25, 2020  Amen — David Alan Grier (@davidalangrier) March 24, 2020  As of this writing, Hillary’s plagiarism has been retweeted over 320,000 times and “liked” 1.4 million times. And this is joke stealing. Hillary might not have worded the joke in the exact same way Maher did, but the set-up and punch-line are exactly the same. That’s called joke theft. For instance, a number of people have responded to Hillary’s tweet with jokes about how it would also not be a good idea to “take medical advice from someone who can’t find Wisconsin on a map.” This refers to the fact that during the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary assumed she had the state of Wisconsin in the bag, didn’t hold one event there, and lost it to Trump. Someone could easily reword that joke in any number of ways; it’s still plagiarism if the set-up and punch line are the same: i.e., You were too dumb to visit Wisconsin! In her defense, near the end of the 2016 campaign, Hillary was so exhausted and sickly, she was seen being hurled into a van like a sack of dirty clothes. And Wisconsin is a long ways from New York. Anyway, what we have here is one more example of Hillary Clinton standing on the shoulders of a man to achieve something she could never have achieved on her own. One day she’s standing on the shoulders of her cheating husband to carpetbag a U.S. Senate seat in New York, and the next she’s perched on Bill Maher’s shoulders hoping to achieve something as pathetic as a cheap laugh on social media.

"Tuesday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) argued that President Donald Trump’s “irresponsible rhetoric” was backed up by “weakness” with his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Hayes asked, “Senator, let me start with this idea of this sort of drumbeat in the last few days of we have to get open, we have to open back up for business, we can’t let the cure be worse than the disease. What do you make of that rhetoric? What do you think about the Easter idea?” Booker said, “Well, that’s a drumbeat of one, and this president is being wildly irresponsible. What we need from him, what we need from our leadership, is direct candor, is getting people prepared for what is coming. We know when we rely on data and science, not a president that seems to ignore both of those things, we know that the worst is yet to come in terms of the medical crisis that we have and in terms of the economic crisis.” He added, “This is a crisis that is growing, and what we need is straight talk, candor, and strength. The problem is that his irresponsible rhetoric is being backed up by a weakness, by his inability to use his executive powers like the Defense Production Act that could be moving more resources to areas of critical need like New York, like New Jersey, like Georgia, like Michigan and other places you named. So this is not a time for us to try to candy coat things. Americans deserve the truth.

"MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell on Tuesday evening said “millions” of Americans will die in May if President Donald Trump gets his wish for “packed churches” all over the country on Easter Sunday. After playing a clip of Trump saying he wanted “packed churches” on Easter Sunday, O’Donnell said it is “utter nonsense but it is deadly nonsense.” “If that happened on Easter Sunday, just 19 days from now, then in May, you’d have millions of dead people all over the country. Millions,” O’Donnell said on his MSNBC show. “If you have packed churches all over the country, including California, on Easter Sunday, by May there could be a million dead people in California.” O’Donnell said that fortunately Trump does not have control over whether people in states like Massachusetts or Louisiana go back to work and mentioned that “none of the governors who have shut down their states has paid any attention to what Donald Trump thinks about shutting down businesses” and his “fever dreams.” “Churches are not going to be packed all over the country on Easter,” O’Donnell predicted. “The Pope has canceled public Easter Sunday services at the Vatican and he did it two weeks ago. And Donald Trump wants you in a packed church in America on Easter Sunday. The Pope doesn’t want you to die by going to church.” When asked on Tuesday why he thought it would be a good time to re-start the economy around Easter, Trump replied: “I just thought it was a beautiful time.” “I just thought it was a beautiful time,” Trump says when asked who suggested that Easter could be a good time to open the economy. “It was based on a certain level of weeks from the time we started,” he adds when asked if decision was based on data. https://t.co/9IWm1671QB pic.twitter.com/6Qf2ZsMqfq — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 24, 2020     ",MSNBC’s O’Donnell Predicts ‘Millions’ Will Die if Churches ‘Packed’ on Easter,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/25/msnbcs-odonnell-predicts-millions-will-die-if-churches-packed-on-easter/,Breitbart

Sanders’ campaign confirmed the Vermont senator will join a debate next month if the DNC schedules one. While the DNC previously indicated it would hold another debate, none is currently on the schedule for April, likely due to the growing uncertainty spurred by the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. “Senator Sanders is still running for president,” Sanders campaign official Mike Casca said, according to the New York Times. “If there is a debate in April, he plans to be there.” DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa “declined to say whether a debate would still take place in April as planned or move later in the calendar to follow primary contests from several states that have switched from April to June.” She has, however, said the Democratic National Convention is still slated to proceed in July. “There are no plans to cancel the convention and we are not considering a rules change at this time,” Hinojosa said, according to Politico. “Contingency planning is a routine part of preparations for any convention.” The news comes as several states, including Ohio, Louisiana, and Kentucky, move to postpone their elections amid the pandemic.

"More than 800 Americans have died since the start of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States but transgender activists are speaking out about how people who seek to alter their biological sex through hormone treatments are suffering during the viral health challenge. The pandemic has caused U.S. health official to stop the delivery of non-essential medical treatment to reserve resources to fight the virus. This has hurt transgenders, activists argue in a Newsweek report: The pandemic has less visible consequences unique to vulnerable communities, like the additional burden placed on transgender people. Widespread closures and the strain placed on health care systems have thrown up obstacles to trans people like Tally the Witch author Molly Landgraff, who has experienced disruptions to her hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. “Many trans women use oral doses of hormones, but everyone’s body responds in a different way to the hormone treatments and some, like myself, are unable to metabolize the hormones effectively via pills,” Landgraff told Newsweek. “Heading to the hospital to get my HRT shots administered is undesirable both for putting the additional workload on already strained staff and for the dramatically increased risk of exposure during the inevitable wait times at the emergency or urgent care clinics.” While some trans women administer injections at home, many, like Landgraff, receive injections at clinics that are subject to the kind of disruptions many businesses have experienced, while receiving HRT shots at overburdened hospitals means risking exposure to COVID-19. For trans people, this could mean losing the pathways to drug access they’ve previously depended on, a problem exacerbated by shipping disruptions. Landgraff anticipates border closures and other medical supply shortages presenting additional challenges. “I have to obtain my hormone doses from a compounding pharmacy lab, and I have, even under normal circumstances, been obligated to wait for weeks or even months for them to get supplies,” Landgraff said. Newsweek found transgender advocates for its report, including Dr. Alexis Chavez, a psychiatrist and medical director of the Trevor Project, which is focused in part on the high rate of suicide among those suffering from gender dysphoria. “We know that trans people are less likely to have a primary care provider. They are more likely to delay necessary health care, because of all the negative outcomes that they and their peers have experienced: providers using the wrong names, or genders, or refusing to serve them,” Chávez told Newsweek.  “People really need a relationship with their primary health provider; more than any other time, people need that. So it’s something that can be really difficult for trans people,” Chavez said. The Newsweek article also blamed legislation being crafting by state lawmakers across the country to protect children from life-altering treatment and surgery for causing harm to transgender people during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s so incredibly frustrating that people are using this pandemic as essentially a cover, to say, ‘Let’s try and pass these things through, let’s try to make these really discriminatory laws happen while no one is paying attention,'” Chavez said. “In the midst of a global pandemic, Idaho legislators are focused on singling out and excluding transgender student-athletes—it is shameful,” The Trevor Project’s Head of Advocacy and Government Affairs Sam Brinton said in a statement provided to Newsweek. “The Trevor Project condemns H.B. 500, an unfair and unnecessary bill, and urges Governor Little to reject it. Our elected officials should be expanding opportunities for trans students, not further marginalizing a group already at high risk for bullying and discrimination.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter","Coronavirus: Trangenders, Advocates Claim Disruption of Hormone Therapy Is Harmful",2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/coronavirus-trangenders-advocates-claim-disruption-of-hormone-therapy-is-harmful/,Breitbart

"Individuals who purposely transmit the Chinese coronavirus to others could be charged as terrorists, warns a Department of Justice memo obtained Tuesday by Politico. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen wrote to U.S. Attorneys and law enforcement agency heads nationwide that they may find cases where there is “purposeful exposure and infection of others with COVID-19.” “Because Coronavirus appears to meet the statutory definition of a ‘biological agent’… such acts potentially could implicate the Nation’s terrorism-related statutes,” wrote the DOJ’s second-highest ranking official.  “Threats or attempts to use COVID-19 as a weapon against Americans will not be tolerated.” Rosen did not reference a particular case in which terror charges are being weighed. The Justice Department recently launched a task force to combat hoarding and price gouging of consumers as the scramble to purchase essentials to sustain themselves during the coronavirus outbreak. On Monday, Attorney General William Barr warned hoarders of medical equipment that the federal government has the authority to seize their products due to an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. “If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something that you have to worry about, but if you are sitting on a warehouse with surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door,” Barr told reporters during his remarks at the White House press briefing.",DOJ Memo Warns: People Intentionally Spreading Coronavirus Could Face Terror Charges,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/doj-memo-warns-people-intentionally-spreading-coronavirus-could-face-terror-charges/,Breitbart
"Wednesday on “Fox & Friends,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) reacted to the Senate passing the coronavirus stimulus package after some delay in recent days over what would be included in the bill. Cotton told business owners and workers in America to “hang on” for a few more days because “help is on the way,” adding local governments and those in the medical field are also getting help from the bill. “I’m glad that the Senate Democrats finally took yes for an answer,” Cotton said of the bill. “I want to be very clear. This is not the bill that Nancy Pelosi proposed earlier this week with lots of extraneous measures. What happened last night is the bill that Senator McConnell and Republicans proposed several days ago is now going to pass into law with some more money, which I’ve said we’ve probably needed, regrettably, for things like unemployment insurance for people who are losing their job because of this pandemic, for more medical emergency equipment for our docs and our nurses, as well as for cities and states that are bearing the brunt of a lot of this pandemic, and of course hospitals, too.” He continued, “So, the bill will be very similar to what we proposed a few days ago, but with some more money that is regrettably going to be necessary to respond to this crisis and help people safe and ultimately get this economy back on its feet.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","Cotton to Workers, Business Owners: ‘Hang On’ — ‘Help Is on the Way’",2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/25/gop-sen-cotton-to-workers-business-owners-hang-on-help-is-on-the-way/,Breitbart
"A coronavirus survivor told his story on Monday’s Fox @ Night, explaining how he was diagnosed with the virus and struggling to breathe as he declined in the hospital and his lungs rapidly filled with fluid. Everything changed, he said, after God came into his room and breathed into his lungs. Clay Bentley, a retired sheriff’s deputy from Georgia, shared the story of his miraculous recovery after a bitter battle with the Chinese coronavirus. He believes he contracted the virus after attending a gathering at the Church at Liberty Square in Cartersville, Georgia. He rapidly declined, going to urgent care the next day after struggling to breathe. He was ultimately diagnosed with pneumonia and sent him home. However, he went back to the hospital days later after his condition worsened, and they eventually confirmed that he contracted the coronavirus. “You know I was in the hospital for about 12 days. I guess it was around the fifth or sixth day, the doctors told me we tried everything,” he explained. “We ran all these antibiotics through you. We’ve done all these tests, and he said, ‘You’re worse today than you were when you came in the hospital,'” he continued, noting that the doctor stressed the importance of getting the fluid out of his lungs. At that point, Bentley said he heard God tell him, “You’re getting better.” “I’m just going to tell you, I heard the voice of the Lord tell me as he was telling me that,” he says, ‘You’re getting better. You’re getting better,'” he said. “And about I guess it was about 3 o’clock in the morning I got to the point where I couldn’t even breathe, and I tell you I felt like I had a man laying on my chest and the weight of this man was so heavy that he was taking my breath,” Bentley said. “I mean, it was like I couldn’t even breathe,” he said. “And then all of a sudden I felt this — I felt air blown into my lungs and I know as a believer that God was there with me, and he began to blow air in my lungs and I took a deep breath.” Bentley said the doctor came in the next morning and informed him that he had hardly any fluid left in his lungs and asked him if he was a praying man. “Well here’s the end of the story. The doctor came in the next morning and checked me and he said, ‘You hardly — yesterday you were worse than you’ve ever been and I come in here today and you don’t have hardly any fluid in your lungs at all.'” “And he asked me, he said, ‘I just want to ask you if you’re a praying man,’ and I said, ‘Yes sir. I pray. I pray constantly,'” he explained. “And he said, ‘Well I have found in my practice when people pray, when people pray, that positive energy causes the body to begin to heal itself.’ And I said, ‘You can believe that if you want to, but I’m telling you, God came in my room last night and healed me.'”",Recovered Coronavirus Patient: God Breathed into My Lungs and Healed Me,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/25/recovered-coronavirus-patient-god-breathed-into-my-lungs-and-healed-me/,Breitbart
"An armed citizen who saw a suspect allegedly shooting at police in Fresno, California, on Tuesday evening pulled out his handgun, took aim, and fired, driving the suspect to the ground. Fox 26 News reports the suspect crashed his car after being pursued by police. The pursuit was the result of the suspect allegedly refusing to pull over after police spotted him speeding. After crashing, the suspect allegedly exited his vehicle with a shotgun, and fired at police. As the suspect began to flee on foot a citizen with a concealed carry permit drew his handgun and shot at the suspect, “making him fall to the ground.” The suspect then hopped back up and began running, only to be tackled by a second bystander. The Fresno Bee reports that “the suspect was injured from being shot. He had wounds on his upper chest.” No officers were hurt.

"U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has directed the Federal Student Aid (FSA) office to halt collection actions and wage garnishments against students who have defaulted on their education loans. According to a press release, DeVos’s department will refund more than $1.8 billion to more than 830,000 students in default in order to provide assistance during the coronavirus crisis. DeVos said in a statement: These are difficult times for many Americans, and we don’t want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress. Americans counting on their tax refund or Social Security check to make ends meet during this national emergency should receive those funds, and our actions today will make sure they do.

The education department has halted all requests to the U.S. Treasury to deny funds from defaulted borrowers’ federal income tax refunds, Social Security payments, and other “Treasury offsets.” DeVos has also instructed private collection agencies to stop their activities to obtain payments from student borrowers. Trump announced students with federal loans would automatically have their interest rates dialed back to 0 percent for a period of at least 60 days. Students may also suspend their loan payments for at least two months to allow greater flexibility during the emergency situation. Education department site studentaid.gov states: To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency, federal student loan borrowers can be placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payment.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sought to insert legislative measures into a coronavirus relief bill to “make it easier to cheat” in elections, explained Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Heritage Foundation’s Election Law Reform Initiative and a senior legal fellow of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Von Spakovsky said, “It’s an attempt to use the coronavirus and the medical crisis we face to force all these changes and election laws the left has been pushing for quite a while, in fact, they took all these provisions out of H.R.1 — which is the first bill the Democrats introduced in the House after they took over when they won the 2018 election, and these rules were all intended to basically make it easier to manipulate elections, and frankly, make it easier to cheat, and they have absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with helping the country deal with the coronavirus.” LISTEN:
 Pelosi proposed a mandate for all states to allow no-excuse absentee voting, including removal of associated voter identification requirements such as the attachment of notarization or witness signatures to absentee ballots. Von Spakovsky explained, “One of the things in this bill that Pelosi has dropped says that not only does every state have to provide no-excuse absentee ballots, but they can’t require notarization or witness signatures of the absentee ballot. They can’t require an ID. Those are all those are all procedures intended to make it easier to submit fraudulent ballots.” Pelosi also wanted states allowing for early voting to begin counting votes 14 days before election day, allowing for manipulation of public opinion via leaks of such information ahead of an election. Such a measure “makes no sense whatsoever, unless you want to be able to manipulate election results,” determined von Spakovsky. “This federal law would require every state to start processing and scanning ballots 14 days before election day,” stated von Spakovsky. “In other words, they would start tabulating the votes before everyone has even voted. Now, what do you think is going to happen if that information has been leaked out to candidates who, for example, the early early accounting shows are losing? They’re going to use that information to try to change what’s happening in the election or some voters who haven’t yet voted may decide, ‘Well, there’s no point in going to the polls. My candidate is losing.'” Von Spakovsky added, “There’s a good reason why states today say we’re not going to start counting all the ballots until the end of election day, and it’s to prevent information from getting out that could change the election results. … This is a way of trying to manipulate election results and why in the world put this in a bill having to do with the coronavirus?” Pelosi tried to initiate online voting, von Spakovsky noted. “There’s a reason we don’t have internet voting and other things like that, because the amount of fraud and hacking that occurs on the internet is huge, but [Nancy Pelosi] is basically saying we want to be able to allow that in the election process,” von Spakovsky remarked. Pelosi wanted California’s allowing of vote harvesting to become a national standard, von Spakovsky stated, which would allow political candidates, campaign workers, and others directly invested in electoral outcomes to collect and submit absentee and mail-in ballots. Von Spakovsky said, “This bill of Pelosi’s mandates that states allow vote harvesting. It mandates that they allow candidates and political consultants and others to be able to pick up absentee ballots, which is just foolish unless you want to put ballots in the hands of people who have a stake in the outcome, and then they’ll have an opportunity to alter ballots or toss out the ballots [from] people who they know are going to be voting for candidates they don’t want to have win.” “We’ve seen cases … from all over the country involving absentee ballot fraud and this makes it easier to commit that,” determined von Spakovsky. Pelosi intended to prohibit states from requiring the provision and verification of a person’s social security number during voter registration. “There’s a handful of states that require you, when you register to vote, to provide your full social security number,” noted von Spakovsky. “That makes it easier to identify voters and make sure they haven’t registered more than once or making other mistakes with them. This federal law bans states from doing, so why in the world would [Nancy Pelosi] do that unless they’re trying to make it easier for fraud to occur in the election process?” Requiring states to allow online voter registration is another method proposed by Pelosi that would make electoral fraud easier, noted von Spakovsky. “There are some states now that do allow online registration, but only if the state already has a record on you,” explained von Spakovsky, noting that such states require prior in-person verification of a person’s identity via the provision of a driver’s license or other form of identification. Von Spakovsky went on, “In those states — Georgia is one of them — you can then go online and register using that prior information the state has on you … but what [Nancy Pelosi] is saying here is states have to allow anybody to register online. Well, when you do that, how in the world is the state going to be able to authenticate that you’re a real person or that you really live where you claim to say you’re living? There’s no way to do that.” Mansour quipped, “So basically, registering to vote is about as simple as subscribing to the New York Times website, just fill in your name and your email address and you’re fine.” Pelosi and Democrats seek to eliminate states’ abilities to verify the identity of voters, von Spakovsky said. “When it comes to voter registration and voting by absentee ballot, they’re getting rid of absolutely every ability states have to check the accuracy of the of the information they’re receiving, and to make sure you’re real person, you really exist, [and] you really live where where you say you live,” remarked von Spakovsky. “All these things that are needed to maintain the security and integrity of the election process, they’re trying to get rid of all of that.” Von Spakovsky concluded, “[Democrats] see this as the key to winning elections by any means possible, and that’s why they want this. If they can use this to cheat, to manipulate election results so that they win and they’re able to retain and gain power, well then all the other things they want, like the Green New Deal and everything else, they’ll be able to do it because they’re going to be in office.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

"The Department of Homeland Security was notified that New York City’s morgues are nearing capacity, a federal official and another individual with knowledge of the matter told Politico. Politico reports: Officials were told that morgues in the city are expected to reach capacity next week, per the briefing. A third person familiar with the situation in New York said that some of the city’s hospital morgues hit capacity over the last seven days. If the available morgue space in New York City fills up as the number of COVID-19 deaths increases, federal help will be available, a former senior administration official said, noting that the George W. Bush administration sent mortuary assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the September 11 attacks. […] For now, city officials do not seem especially alarmed. Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), said concerns about morgue capacity may be unfounded. In Manhattan alone, she said, OCME’s morgue can store up to 900 bodies. The city has a morgue for each of the five boroughs, she said. Worthy-Davis told the news outlet that the city has the resources to increase capacity “pretty dramatically,” adding that “If you look back at what we did during 9/11, we have the ability to create mobile stations that allow us to house bodies if we run out of space.” “All hospitals within the city tend to have small morgue spaces, so it’s possible that with the capacity of hospitals in New York City, there may be an expectation … that they’ll run out of morgue space,” she added. The added pressure on New York City morgues comes as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Big Apple officials are considering closing some streets, along with parks and playgrounds to contain the coronavirus outbreak. As of Wednesday, the state has 30,811 concerned cases.",Report: New York City Morgues Near Capacity,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/report-new-york-city-morgues-near-capacity/,Breitbart

"Presidential hopeful Joe Biden (D) criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s statewide response to the coronavirus pandemic, declaring in a statement that “Floridians deserve science-based action.” DeSantis has practiced a cautious approach over the past month, using the CDC’s guidelines as groundwork for the Sunshine State’s floor positions and leaving more aggressive measures, like the mandatory closure of non-essential businesses, up to local governments. Biden released a statement, criticizing DeSantis’s response — seemingly his refusal to issue a statewide stay-at-home order — while praising New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. “In the absence of leadership from President Trump and his Administration, governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York and Mike DeWine of Ohio are stepping up during this time of crisis to fill the void and protect our most vulnerable,” Biden said in a statement. “Floridians deserve science-based action from Governor Ron DeSantis,” he continued. He added: This deadly pandemic does not discriminate along party lines, zip codes, gender, race and certainly not state, county, or city lines. While other states continue to take strong, urgent, and sweeping action to stop the spread of COVID-19, Florida has not. I urge Governor DeSantis to let the experts speak to the public and explain why this is the case. In this moment of growing uncertainty and anxiety, Floridians want — and deserve — to hear from the public health officials leading the charge. To get through this, we need our leaders to listen to the public health experts and their guidance. The stakes are too high to wait any longer. Despite Biden’s assertion, DeSantis has taken a number of aggressive actions. He signed an executive order this week requiring those traveling to Florida from the New York Tri-State area — one of the country’s coronavirus hotspots — to self-quarantine for 14 days and warned that it is “actually a criminal offense if you violate the quarantine order.” Per the order: Any person who violates any isolation or quarantine directed by the Department of Health commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, which is punishable by imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, a fine not to exceed $500, or both. See § 381.00315(6), Fla. Stat. Last week, DeSantis announced a 30-day closure of nightclubs and bars. He has since ordered a statewide halt of dine-in services, as well as the suspension of elective medical procedures. Nevertheless, the Florida governor has refrained from issuing a sweeping stay-at-home order, publicly questioning its viability. “It’s not clear to me that doing a massive shut down of an entire state would even work,” DeSantis said. “In New York City, it’s like the party never ended. You got people congregating all over the place.” “You see images from California in Orange County … the beaches may have never been so crowded. These are people who have been ordered to shelter in place and they are not complying with those orders,” he added.","Joe Biden Attacks FL Gov.

"U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to repatriate about 13,500 Americans stranded overseas amid the accelerating coronavirus global outbreak, a State Department official revealed on Monday. The Trump administration has already evacuated some 5,700 Americans from 17 countries, according to State. Speaking on background, the official noted the U.S. is using military aircraft, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deportation planes, and chartered flights to get some Americans home while asking others to avail themselves of commercial means to return when possible. “We are also helping private carriers increase the number of flights they have,” the official said. The window to return to the United States by commercial planes is “closing fast,” State warned. The State Department’s message to people overseas is for them to try to leave now unless they are “ready to ride out an undetermined period of time” at their current location, the official said. An estimated ten million U.S. citizens are living abroad. That figure, however, does not represent “the entire universe of people who would be seeking to return to the United States,” the official explained, adding: The people who are seeking our assistance at the moment are what we might consider the expats or tourists who are overseas temporarily. They’re the ones whose homes are here in the United States, in other words trying to come home to ride out this crisis. … We have so far seen 13,500 or so thousand U.S. citizens who have requested some form of assistance [in returning home] and registered with us. The official stopped short of saying at this point the U.S. government is confident there will be a way for every American who wants to come home to do so. “We are hearing about people who are in very remote locations in very remote parts of the world. It’s complicated,” the official noted, later adding: I’ve heard about individual people in remote areas in Peru, in Samoa, in [the] Banda [islands] … in Indonesia. So I am hesitant to give a guarantee we can move every single person. We are moving very large numbers of people, and we will continue this effort. Nevertheless, the official emphasized that State has the capacity, in general, to deal with the global crisis unfolding at the moment. “It has been a lot of hard work, and it is going to be a lot of hard work going forward, but yes, we are dealing with this. Yeah, we are devoting all of our resources to this,” the official said. State is reportedly working with DHS, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other agencies to repatriate Americans stuck overseas. The State Department stressed it is rising to meet the “unprecedented global challenge” of getting home Americans overseas impacted by the widening coronavirus outbreak. “We’re working around the clock to bring U.S. citizens who are stranded overseas back home,” the official said. “Our consular officers posted overseas, and their local employee colleagues have been working night and day to help Americans get on flights.” “There’s a 24-7 task force here in Washington supporting that effort,” the official added. Before establishing the task force last week, the U.S. evacuated over 800 people from the epicenter of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, over 300 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan,” and 1,200 out of Morocco, among others from Central America and other places. The official said: In total, to date, we have brought home more than 5,000 Americans from 17 countries, and we’re bringing home thousands more in the coming days and weeks. … We’re looking at now 16 or so flights in the next five days, and we’ve got, at this point, over 1,600 passengers identified for those flights. There’s room for more. He noted that, as of Monday, the Peruvian government had not yet given the okay for the U.S. to evacuate Americans stuck in the South American country. Regarding State’s 75,000-person workforce in over 220 locations around, the official said, there is a contingency plan in place to evacuate them if necessary, adding: If we have to charter an aircraft to bring out what we call [the] chief of mission personnel and there’s additional space available on those flights, we will make those additional seats available to private U.S. citizens seeking to depart those countries. So this is an ongoing dynamic situation as the virus spreads, and more and more posts go on authorized or ordered departure. The number of State employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus stands at “less than 30,” the official said. State is urging Americans overseas to enroll in the federal government’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. “This is how embassies communicate important health and safety information to U.S. citizens in real-time,” the official pointed out. The official also noted that Americans could get information by calling 1-888-407-4747 from within the United States and 1-202-501-4444 from overseas.","Coronavirus: U.S. Working to Repatriate 13,500 Americans Stuck Overseas",2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/25/coronavirus-u-s-working-to-repatriate-13500-americans-stuck-overseas/,Breitbart
"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator and White House Coronavirus Task Force team member Seema Verma told Breitbart News Daily how America can “overcome” the coronavirus and what the Donald Trump administration is doing to help Americans throughout the crisis. Verma first spoke to Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow about the CMS’s waiver to expand telehealth, which expands the ability for Americans to talk with their doctor remotely. The CMS administrator said that the telehealth expansion grants Americans greater access to health care and slows the spread of the coronavirus by preventing the spread of the disease to other Americans at the doctor’s office or hospital. Verma said, “It is rapidly expanding across the country under the president’s leadership. One of the things that we know right now is that it’s better for people to stay at home. Those are the recommendations the president and the vice president have put out, 15 days to slow the spread. We’ve said very clearly to individuals, especially those that are elderly with underlying health conditions, that you need to stay home. And so that’s why we’re using telehealth and promoting telehealth because we know that people still need health care. It may be completely unrelated to the coronavirus, you may have heart disease and diabetes, it allows people to communicate with their doctors from the safety of their own home, which is so important.”  She continued, “Also, for individuals that are experiencing flu-like symptoms, it’s better that they have a conversation with their doctor over the phone rather than come into the office or traveling, they could be sitting in their waiting room and infecting other people. So, what we’re finding since these changes have been made, the president has made these announcements a couple of weeks ago is just rapidly expanding across the country. Many healthcare providers were doing this telehealth before, others were not, and that’s why when we put out this announcement, we said you don’t need any special equipment, we’re going to relax some of the rules and regulations so that doctors can just use Facetime, they can just use Skype, they can be able to communicate with their patients.”  Verma also urged Americans to help join the cause to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. She said that Americans should wash their hands frequently, stay at home to practice “social distancing,” and to contact their doctor if they believe they have coronavirus symptoms.  Marlow noted that Vice President Mike Pence said during a recent press conference that reportedly 90 percent of people that get tested for coronavirus end up not having coronavirus.  “We are also in flu season, so if you are sick, it may or may not be because of the COVID virus,” Verma noted.  “We’re learning that it’s a sticky virus, it stays on surfaces longer, and I think that we should keep that in mind in terms of the precautions that we’re taking,” she added. Marlow noted that the infection rate for parts of the country other than the New York state remains relatively low. Verma attributed that success because many communities are following the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) recommendation to lower the spread of the coronavirus as well as the Trump administration’s rapid expansion of coronavirus testing. Verma emphasized that the Trump administration has passed a new milestone: they have administered more tests in one week than South Korea has completed during this coronavirus outbreak. She said, “It could be for two reasons: a lot of communities are listening to the recommendations if you’re taking aggressive mitigation strategies that could have an impact on the rate of spread in communities. The second thing is the testing, and we’re still working through the backlog of tests that’s increased dramatically. Yesterday they announced that we have done as many tests as South Korea; we did as many tests last week as South Korea has done in total. That is rapidly increasing, and it could give us a better sense where the virus is to til this point, we haven’t had a lot of data catching up. So, I think it’s rapidly changing, that’s with the mitigation strategies is so important, 15 days to slow the spread. All of the recommendations about staying at home, especially if you’re sick, washing your hands, that’s why it’s so important because we want to do better than the models could show us that could potentially happen.” Verma’s interview on Breitbart News Daily follows as President Trump said during a Fox News town hall that he would like to start reopening the economy by Easter, which is roughly two weeks away. “I would love to have the country opened up and rearing to go by Easter,” the president said. Verma said that the Trump administration remains optimistic for a quick reopening of the economy; however, the president will only make the decision to do so after it remains safe for Americans to start returning normal life. She said, “I think we’re trying to remain optimistic, but at the end of the day, we’re going to use data to guide our decisions. I think the president has from the very beginning made strong decisions based on data. We had some of the world’s leading experts advising the president, and he’s done a great job of listening to them and making decisions, and he’ll continue to do that. I think Easter is a timeframe. At the end of the day, he is going to make decisions based on the data, and he’s going to do what’s best to make sure that they’re safe.” Verma added that the phase three congressional coronavirus response package “is an important part of our overall response. We have a strong public health response, but also having an economic response is the recognition that so many families are being impacted, workers that want to work, we are being told to stay at home. So this is an important part of the overall strategy.” Reports have suggested that the anti-malaria drug chloroquine could serve as a potential treatment of the coronavirus. Trump has promoted the use of chloroquine. Verma said that there are many potential treatments of coronavirus; although, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should ensure that any possible treatments are safe and effective against the coronavirus. Verma concluded, urging Americans to take precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “I know it’s hard but you got to listen to the recommendations, 15 days to slow the spread. It’s very important that we all do our part,” she said. “As Americans, we’re strong, we’re resilient, and this is just a war that we’re fighting that we will successfully overcome.” Breitbart News Daily airs SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

"Unemployment benefits will reportedly be extended to groups including gig economy workers like Uber drivers based on a bipartisan deal struck this week. Axios reports that according to a statement from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), unemployment benefits will be extended to groups including gig economy workers. Such a move is an unprecedented expansion of benefits to gig economy workers who have been classified as independent contractors instead of employes by multiple companies such as ride-sharing firms Uber and Lyft. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent a letter to President Trump earlier this week asking the government to include gig economy workers in the stimulus bill. Khosrowshahi reportedly spoke with Schumer last week and reached out to the house to speak to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell although it is unclear if they spoke. Schumer’s letter to Democratic senators stated that unemployment benefits would extend to four months, workers would receive normal benefits from their states as well as an additional $600 per week from the federal package. This would apply to employees, self-employed individuals, and gig economy workers. Uber’s sudden support of the bill is surprising given that just a few months ago, the firm was filing lawsuits aimed at preventing a California law that would reclassify gig workers as employees from passing. Breitbart News reported in December 2019: The lawsuit, filed Monday in a Los Angeles federal court, claims that the law violates the U.S. Constitution because it singles out app-based gig workers and online companies for unfair treatment, according to multiple reports. The companies claim that the law would deprive their drivers of the right to earn a living in the manner of their choosing. They also called it a “thinly veiled attempt” to target gig economy businesses. “It irreparably harms network companies and app-based independent service providers by denying their constitutional rights to be treated the same as others to whom they are similarly situated,” the complaint states. Silicon Valley tech giants have mobilized to combat the new law, which was known as AB5. and is set to take effect January 1. The law would potentially entitle gig workers to benefits and perks, like a minimum wage and sick pay. Uber attorneys argued earlier this year that the law doesn’t apply to the company because drivers’ work falls  “outside the usual course of Uber’s business,” which they define as providing a technology platform. The ridesharing company is joining forces with Lyft and Doordash to mount a $90 million counteroffensive against the new law. Read the full article at Breitbart News here.

"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is pursuing a plan to house 6,000 homeless people in recreation centers in residential neighborhoods during the coronavirus pandemic. But that plan ignores Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines on the subject. The CDC’s “Interim Guidance for Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness” does not recommend moving large numbers of homeless people indoors. It acknowledges: “Lack of housing contributes to poor health outcomes, and linkage to permanent housing should continue to be a priority.” However, the CDC adds the spread of coronavirus in close quarters must be considered: In the context of COVID-19, the risks associated with sleeping outdoors in an encampment setting are different than with staying indoors in a congregate setting such as an emergency shelter or other congregate living facility. Outdoor settings may allow people to increase distance between themselves and others. However, sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment, quick access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to healthcare. The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness. It is not clear how Garcetti’s plan assesses the “balance of risks.” In his statement last week announcing the plan, Garcetti did not mention the CDC guidelines. His plan aims simply “to help get homeless Angelenos indoors more quickly.” As the CDC guidelines suggest, moving people indoors may thwart efforts at “social distancing.” The guidelines are adamant that while informal encampments are at risk for the spread of coronavirus, authorities should not clear them during a coronavirus outbreak, because residents could spread coronavirus elsewhere. The mayor did not mention encampments, but he is relocating thousands of people, raising concerns among some residents that infection, if it exists, could be easily, if unintentionally, spread to their communities. The CDC also adds that “[p]lans need to be clearly communicated to all stakeholders.” Local communities, as well as some homeless people themselves, have complained that they do not understand the city’s plan.

"Appearing Tuesday on Philadelphia’s AM 990 The Answer Radio, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he would certainly prescribe Chloroquine to coronavirus-stricken patients in the wake of testimonies stating it could treat the deadly disease. (Listen from 52:20) A partial transcript is as follows:  CHRIS STIGALL:If you’re a doctor listening to me right now and a patient with coronavirus feels like they want to try [Chloroquine] and you’re their doctor, you’re not Anthony Fauci the guy running the coronavirus task force, would you say ‘alright, we’ll give it a whirl’? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah, of course, particularly if people have no other option. You want to give them hope. In fact, for physicians in this country, these drugs are approved drugs for other reasons. They’re anti-malaria drugs and they’re drugs against certain autoimmune diseases, like lupus. Physicians throughout the country can prescribe that in an off-label way. Which means they can write it for something it was not originally approved for. People do that all the time, and it really is an individual choice between the physician and his or her patient as to whether or not they want to do that.  Despite Fauci’s remarks, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) signed an emergency hours later order banning the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus.

"The eco-fascists are showing their true face in the Coronavirus pandemic. Activists claiming to be from Extinction Rebellion have put up posters exulting in the loss of human life. They say: “Corona is the cure Humans are the disease.” Earth is healing. The air and water is clearing. Corona is the cure.Humans are the disease!#ClimateCrisis #CoronaCrisis #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/nYJp30WhtH — XREastMidlands (@xr_east) March 24, 2020  The official national leadership of Extinction Rebellion has since sought to distance itself from the posters, claiming that the stickers are ‘not in line with what XR believes or stands for’ and blaming ‘far right groups.’ IMPORTANT: We are aware that far right groups have put out stickers with messaging that is not in line with what XR believes or stands for.

First, the XR East Midlands Twitter account which boasted about the stunt is widely followed by XR groups around the country. If it has been a ‘far right’ disinformation operation, it appears to have fooled pretty much the entirety of the XR movement – which has repeatedly tweeted its views and seems to share many of them. There is no evidence that the XR account https://t.co/7oNFhxRg36 is fake or far right. In fact, their anti-human sentiment is widely shared among on social media in recent weeks. @afneil https://t.co/uPDowJqILF — GWPF (@thegwpfcom) March 25, 2020  Second, the posters are entirely in line with the thinking of the green movement – as detailed in my book Watermelons: How Environmentalists are Killing the Planet, Destroying the Economy and Stealing Your Children’s Future. As high-level environmentalist organisation The Club of Rome once infamously wrote: “The Earth has a cancer. The cancer is man.” This is genuinely how many so-called environmentalists think. It dates back at least to the era of late 18th century doom monger Thomas Malthus and is evident in everything from the burblings of Sir David Attenborough (a former trustee of the Optimum Population Trust which, up until 2011, argued on its website that the world’s then-population of 6.8 billion should be reduced to a more ‘sustainable’ 5.1 billion) to the entire field of ecology (predicated on the notion that man is a detrimental presence on the planet). Here is that mode of thinking – worryingly popular among the global elite – expressed in the 1970s by one of the early enthusiasts of the green movement, the late gambler, tiger-enthusiast and casino owner John Aspinall. Some of us are now drawn to believe that a demo-catastrophe will be an eco-bonanza. In other words, a population readjustment on a planetary scale from 4,000 million to something in the nature of 200 minion would be the only possible solution for the survival of the eco-system or systems that nurtured us. Environmentalists, you may suspect, are the very last people we should be heeding in this coronavirus pandemic. Not only are they partly responsible for the misdirection of scientific resources which has left us so woefully ill-prepared for the disease – but a worrying proportion of them actually welcome this plague because they see it as Gaia’s revenge on evil mankind.",Delingpole: Eco-Fascists Deny Responsibility For ‘Corona Is the Cure; Humans are the Disease’ Signs,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/25/eco-loons-deny-responsibility-corona-is-the-cure-humans-the-disease/,Breitbart
"Rapper Cardi B filmed one of her trademark rants slamming President Donald Trump and the wider government’s response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, claiming that the worst of its spread “could’ve been prevented” if they had taken action sooner. In an Instagram video posted Tuesday to her over 61 million followers, the New York-born rapper sported a medical mask as she accused Trump of creating confusion among the general public. “Number 45 is getting on a podium saying, ‘Hey, listen: if you do not have any symptoms of the coronavirus — coughing, fever and whatsoever, etc. etc. — do not get tested because we don’t have enough testings to test everybody,” said the artist, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar. “But if a celebrity is saying, ‘Hey, listen, I don’t have no symptoms, I’m feeling good, I feel healthy, I don’t feel like nothing but I went and got tested and I’m positive for the coronavirus, that causes confusion,” she continued.     I said what I said A post shared by  Cardi B (@iamcardib) on Mar 24, 2020 at 4:42pm PDT During the expletive-laden rant, the 27-year-old also suggested the effective nationwide lockdown is unfair to those cooped up in small apartments with many occupants. “What do they think they’re sending people home to? Not everybody have [sic] the luxury to go in their fucking bedroom and to go in a big-ass house and get away from people,” she exclaimed. “A lot of people live in small-ass apartments with multiple people. So it’s like if you’re sending me home and I have the corona-fucking-virus I’m most likely going to give it to my spouse, my kids, anybody that’s around me.” Almánzar, who is a fervent supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s seemingly unsuccessful presidential campaign, also demanded that the government pick up the bill for all health care costs associated with the pandemic. “I feel like the government should take that shit… and not charge people for it, because at the end of the day this shit could’ve been prevented when they found out about this shit a couple of months ago and the shit it was doing in China,” she declared. “Some people don’t even have enough money to fucking afford health care.” Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.",Cardi B Slams Trump’s Coronavirus Response: ‘Could’ve Been Prevented’,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/03/25/cardi-b-slams-trumps-coronavirus-response-couldve-been-prevented/,Breitbart
"In America, we are known for having thoughtful discussions about painful topics. But as the federal, state, and even municipal governments around the country are making decisions and taking actions to respond to the threat of the coronavirus, I can’t help but wonder – when did I fall asleep in America and wake up elsewhere? For instance, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pulled together a 1,432-page coronavirus emergency response “stimulus” bill that includes items totally unrelated to the public health crisis. Se wrote it secretly, without benefit of any public hearings, witness testimony, markup sessions, or debate on the floor of the House. It includes $35 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington; requires same-day voter registration; makes airlines cut their carbon footprint in half by 2050; and eliminates the U.S. Postal Service’s debt.  That just adds to my confusion. The American Experiment, begun with the “shot heard ‘round the world,” and formalized with the constitutional convention in Philadelphia a dozen years later, turned the world upside down because it, for the first time, declared boldly that all men were created equal; that they were endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights; that the purpose of government was to secure those rights; and that the only legitimate and just government was a government that derived its power from the consent of the governed.  The people were sovereign, and our Constitution established a government of limited and enumerated powers – and, importantly, any power not expressly given to the federal government was reserved to the states, and to the people. Since the ratification of that Constitution close to two-and-a-half centuries ago, we have had representative government, where we choose via regular elections the leaders who will make decisions on our behalf, after discussion and debate in the two houses of Congress.  Alexander Hamilton said at the New York state convention on the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, “Here, sir, the people govern; here they act by their immediate representatives.” Yet, faced with the novel coronavirus and the threat it poses to us, our representatives in the Congress and elsewhere have seemingly forgotten that.  Where they should be arguing over the pros and cons of various courses of action, they have chosen instead to avoid debate and simply to acquiesce to the directives of medical experts. I understand the motivations of the medical experts. It is to avoid what they fear will be a medical calamity. But what good does it do to avoid the medical calamity, if the cost is an even more disastrous economic and financial calamity – and of our own making, at that? An exercise in the House of Representatives ten days ago is a case in point. After being told early in the week that negotiations for coronavirus funding would take place between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over the particulars, everyone else was shut out of the process. It wasn’t just our lowly Representatives that were shut out – even powerful committee chairmen were left in the dark. Late that Friday evening, the two finally came to agreement, and the bill was brought forward for a vote, and a perfunctory debate.  Since the bill was brought to the floor of the House under suspension of the rules, the debate was limited to 40 minutes – 20 minutes for those in support of the bill, and 20 minutes for those opposed.  But very few people knew what was in the bill. It had been released less than an hour before it was put on the floor. The Congressional Budget Office hadn’t had time to score it, so no one knew how much it would cost.  Consequently, the 40 minutes of debate shrank to just 20 minutes or so – and then, without anyone even knowing how much the bill would cost the American taxpayer, or how much harm it might do to our economy, it was overwhelmingly passed, with just 40 representatives voting against. The bill was so hastily drafted that it needed a “technical corrections” bill to fix its errors – “corrections” that were almost half again as long as the original text. This is not what the Framers envisioned.  The Framers designed the Constitution for exactly this kind of emergency – to protect liberty as the government makes decisions such as the ones we face with the coronavirus crisis.  We do that best as a result of vigorous discussion and debate, giving all sides an opportunity to make their arguments even as they consider other alternatives.  Speaker Pelosi, bring the House back into session to do the people’s work with a vigorous discussion. Stop trying to use this crisis to legitimize your power grab, and stay focused on the task at hand – responding to the public health emergency posed by the coronavirus, and the economic calamity imposed on us by the government’s response to it.  Let the other 434 Representatives argue over alternatives, as they should. It’s their job.","Jenny Beth Martin: Act Quickly, But Let Congress Have a Serious Debate",2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/25/congress-debate/,Breitbart
"Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) on Wednesday urged Americans to support each other as lawmakers work to strike a deal on a measure providing economic relief during the coronavirus pandemic and blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for taking credit for the latest relief package. The senator spoke to Breitbart News Daily about her latest challenge, #MyCOVIDfive, encouraging Americans to check on at least five people and see if they need anything, given the chaotic state of the world caused by the coronavirus. “The government can only do so much for our citizens. It’s up to our individuals, our citizens, to reach out to each other and make sure they are being supported,” she said. Today I started #MyCOVIDfive by checking in with nearly a dozen folks to make sure they were doing okay.

And while the government can’t get out and get their groceries for them, a neighbor can. So what I’m asking, just check on five folks. Make sure you’re reaching out,” she continued, urging Americans to contact vulnerable people, particularly, and offer assistance — whether it be picking up groceries or running to the post office. “Whatever it might happen to be. Just ask them, ‘Can I help you?’” she said, stressing the importance of making sure others know that “people care.” “This is a hard time. I know of a lot of folks that are now out of work because they were working in the service restaurants, hotels, whatever,” she explained. “There’s a lot of anxiety right there, and until we get our package done here in Congress, I know they’re going to continue having anxiety, and then when does this end. So we’ll keep plugging through, but just through this entire event, this episode of coronavirus, we want to make sure that we are caring for each other.” “You know the government can do so much, individuals can do so much more,” Ernst added. That connection could help bridge the gap, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill work on a bill to provide economic relief to the American people. Lawmakers, Ernst said, originally had a “very, very strong” and bipartisan relief package, but Democrats shot it down after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) flew into town. “And then boom, [it] got hit by, you know, the House suggestions, which included all kinds of things from airplane emissions standards, you know, Green New Deal kind of stuff, to supporting various art centers. That was not the focus of the bill. The bill was to focus on the pandemic and the issue at hand,” she said, shredding Pelosi’s partisan demands. “Some of these other policy changes — same-day voter registration, federalizing the elections, you know stuff like that. We can have that debate another day. So we were absolutely horrified at what the Democrats were trying to do,” she said. Congress was able to strike a deal on a $2 trillion relief bill early Wednesday morning, but Ernst said it is essentially “the same bill that we had over the weekend.” “What is driving me crazy right now is the fact that Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is out there touting, ‘Oh well we put in unemployment, and we did this.’ I’m sorry Mr. Schumer, but all of that was in the original bill,” Ernst said. “So while he’s out there trying to take credit for what we have in front of us now, he did absolutely nothing but delay this product from getting onto the floor of the Senate and being voted on by our body,” she continued. Ernst said she wants the American people to understand that, at the end of the day, the bill that is presented today is virtually the same as the original bill, which Democrats blocked. “So when you hear him touting what a great deal the Democrats came up with, I want everybody to understand and realize that this is, large and part, the same package we had two days ago that they outright rejected — delay tactics by the Democratic Party at the expense of the American people,” she said.","Exclusive: Joni Ernst Urges Americans to Support Each Other During Crisis, Knocks Schumer over Relief Package",2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/exclusive-joni-ernst-urges-americans-to-support-each-other-during-crisis-knocks-schumer-over-relief-package/,Breitbart
"India’s outsourcing companies are pushing their Fortune 500 clients to relax non-disclosure and other privacy rules as the Indian government shuts down workplaces to curb the spread of China’s Wuhan virus. Bloomberg.com reported March 23: Infosys Ltd., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and other Indian firms that employ more than four million people in tech hubs such as Bengaluru, are also requesting that their clients relax non-disclosure and other privacy rules so that employees who must stay at home during the lockdown can still do their jobs. On Sunday, India’s government imposed the nationwide lockdown. “Companies in India are scrambling to ensure that the millions [of employees] who staff the back offices of Wall Street banks and take on work outsourced by firms from airlines to insurers can keep going,” says the report at Bloomberg.com. The Indian employees usually work hand-in-glove with the roughly 1 million Indians contract workers who are located in the United States. The 1 million U.S.-based Indian workers hold work permits via a plethora of white-collar visa programs, including the H-1B, Occupational Practical Training, L-1, B-1, H4EAD, and TN programs. U.S. investors and CEOs use Indian subcontracting companies to import the Indian workers to take over many Americans’ college jobs and to send the work back to teams of Indians in India — regardless of the laws barring national discrimination against American workers. DoJ/EEOC do nothing as US & Indian execs trade US jobs to Indian #H1B workers, cutting Americans out of careers, homes & families.This trade choked innovation in Silicon-V, slammed  insurance & banking. #SenMikeLee & #S386 will expand it to healthcare https://t.co/qoENwyO6X7 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 9, 2020  India’s government has quickly exempted its huge outsourcing industry from much of the epidemic shutdown. “The support that the government in India is extending to the IT industry, including granting exceptions from the lockdown, for key personnel delivering essential and mission-critical services to our clients, is going a long way in helping us be purposeful,” said a statement from U.B. Pravin Rao, a top executive at Infosys. The Wuhan disease is spreading rapidly through the poor and crowded country of 1.3 billion. India’s government has tried to curb the spread by barring workers from their commutes and jobs and is only allowing employees in essential services to commute into work. That policy means that millions of Indians cannot get to their offices to work as long-distance subcontractors for U.S. banking, insurance, travel, transport, and technology companies. In response, the U.S. and Indian companies have been using their shared trade association, Nasscom, to lobby the government to get their Indian-based subcontractors back to work. “Unfortunately, most of these mission critical services cannot be processed outside of the highly secure work premises. Hence, it is important to ensure governments enable the … sector to function as essential services and keep those critical services operational,” Nasscom said in a statement, according to Bloomberg. Despite the exemptions given to Nasscom companies, many of the outsourcing workers are stuck at home — both in Indian and in the United States. The task of getting the home-based Indian employees back into their contract jobs is difficult, said Nasscom officials. “Moving millions of desktops to employees’ homes, configuring software to allow for slower bandwidth and ensuring cybersecurity – it’s a mind-boggling physical and logistical exercise that our companies are in the midst of right now,” Keshav Murugesh, chairman of Nasscom, told Bloomberg. “India’s IT industry has moved nearly two thirds of its 4.36 million workforces to work from home,” according to India’s India Times newspaper. “The $150 billion industry that primarily services overseas clients is allowing these workers to build software and maintain them for clients from remote locations.” But the Indian contractors and the U.S. companies are required by U.S. law to protect Americans’ private data on secure networks. The protected information includes data about Americans’  personal finances and health problems, as well as company marketing data, Bloomberg noted: Privacy is also an issue, with the prospect of millions of workers processing sensitive data from home. Outsourced work from the world’s largest banks, insurers, airlines and retailers are governed by strict non-disclosure agreements. Many companies don’t allow employees to even carry their phones in the workplace for fear of compromising clients’ confidentiality clauses, and restrict access to certain areas to only those working on the project. Many of the privacy rules agreements are entangled in federal law, such as the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which strictly guards data about Americans’ health. In response, the Indian companies are lobbying Americans companies to relax enforcement of privacy rules, Bloomberg said. Infosys Ltd., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and other Indian firms that employ more than four million people in tech hubs such as Bengaluru, are also requesting that their clients relax non-disclosure and other privacy rules so that [Indian] employees who must stay at home during the lockdown can still do their jobs. Elsewhere, many Indians are objecting to Nasscom’s demand for its workers to be exempt from India’s shutdown, according to the India Times: But as Covid-19 continues to disrupt daily life forcing lockdowns across the globe, workers of Indian IT services firms took to social media platforms complaining of employers’ insistence that they come to office. These employees also posted internal emails to support their claim. On a ‘IT Confessions’ Facebook page, an employee from a technology company had anonymously said: “Management of our process has decided to split the staff 50% in general shift and 50% in night shift…My name is not under the list of staff Over the last two years, American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers.

Nasscom claims it has almost $100 billion in outsourcing work and earned roughly $150 billion in revenues during 2019. The companies claimed to employ 4.4 million Indians, including “884,0o0 digitally skilled” workers. Bloomberg provided a shortlist of the many companies that have moved white-collar and pink-collar jobs from American and Europeans into India. For example, 20,000 Indians work for Barclays bank, 10,000 work for Deutsche Bank, 30,000 work for JPMorgan, and 60,000 work for the Union Bank of Switzerland, better known as UBS. “We are working with over 1000 organizations across the world to keep them up and running.” said a March 24 statement from Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO at Tata Consultancy Services.

"Wednesday on MSNBC, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) declared that President Donald Trump was “not fully understanding the depth” of the coronavirus crisis. Anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked, “Yesterday Governor Cuomo said the problems New York is facing with the outbreak of corona is not unique and other cities and states should take it as a warning, it’s going to come to them soon. Juxtapose that against the president’s new position that he wants the whole country back up and running in just a couple of weeks.” Gillibrand said, “The president is being irresponsible and is not fully understanding the depth of this crisis. The coronavirus has been in the United States, some estimate, for two months. That means it’s been in every community around this country. People travel regularly. The reason why you don’t have a great deal of cases showing up in many states is just because the states don’t have testing up and running. There are a lot of people who are sick, have flus they don’t understand, and will have pneumonia they don’t understand. Once they start testing, they can identify those as COVID-19 cases, and then we can have more data to understand how effective social distancing is.” She continued, “This is a time we should be on war footing. This is a time everyone in the country has to sacrifice to do everything necessary to defeat COVID-19. This is the common response we can all make. And this money we’re sending to have help for health care and money in people’s pockets will help us fight the virus, will help fight this epidemic. President Trump is not being realistic, and he’s really, I think, being absurd. This will take a long time. All states will be affected. If we do it right, if we increase testing so everybody can get a drive-through test or test at their community health center, we’ll know what we’re up against, and we’ll have the right response to meet that need.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Gillibrand: ‘Absurd’ Trump ‘Is Not Fully Understanding the Depth’ of Coronavirus Crisis,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/25/gillibrand-absurd-trump-is-not-fully-understanding-the-depth-of-coronavirus-crisis/,Breitbart
"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department is getting involved in a federal civil rights lawsuit that seeks to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from competing as girls in interscholastic sports. Attorney General William Barr signed what is known as a statement of interest Tuesday, arguing against the policy of the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, the board that oversees the state’s high school athletic competitions. The conference allows athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify, arguing it is following a state law that requires high school students be treated according to their gender identity. It also argues the policy is in accordance with Title IX, the federal law that allows girls equal educational opportunities, including in athletics. The Justice Department, in its filing, disagrees. “Under CIAC’s interpretation of Title IX, however, schools may not account for the real physiological differences between men and women. Instead, schools must have certain biological males — namely, those who publicly identify as female — compete against biological females,” Barr and the other department officials write. “In so doing, CIAC deprives those women of the single-sex athletic competitions that are one of the marquee accomplishments of Title IX.” The lawsuit was filed in February by runners Selina Soule, a senior at Glastonbury High School; Chelsea Mitchell, a senior at Canton High School; and Alanna Smith, a sophomore at Danbury High School, against the conference and several local boards of education. They argue they have been deprived of wins, state titles and athletic opportunities by being forced to compete against transgender athletes. “Males will always have inherent physical advantages over comparably talented and trained girls — that’s the reason we have girls sports in the first place,” their attorney, Christiana Holcomb said Wednesday. “And a male’s belief about his gender doesn’t eliminate those advantages.” Messages seeking comment were left Wednesday with the attorneys representing the the athletic conference, other defendants and the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the two transgender girls who run track in Connecticut. The spring track season is on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but conference officials have put off a decision on whether to cancel it. Holcomb has said because the lawsuit also asks for changes to the state record book, the lawsuit will go forward even if it is not resolved before the seniors graduate.",US Justice Department: Don’t Treat Trans Athletes as Girls,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/03/25/us-justice-department-dont-treat-trans-athletes-as-girls/,Breitbart
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened Wednesday to shut down playgrounds if New Yorkers failed to properly distance themselves during the coronavirus crisis. “No close contact sports in a playground,” Cuomo said during a press conference.”No basketball, for example. You cannot do it.” He urged all New Yorkers to voluntarily adjust their behavior at playgrounds to keep the levels of social density at advisable levels. “If there is noncompliance with that, we will then make it mandatory and we will actually close the playgrounds,” he warned. Cuomo said the current social distancing practices were working and urged New Yorkers to continue self-isolating. “This is everything,” he said. “Slowing the hospitalization rates coming into the hospitals are everything so the hospitals can deal with the rate of people coming in.” He also warned the youth to take the crisis seriously. “You may think that you’re a superhero. You’re really not. You can catch it and you can transfer it, which makes it dangerous to the people you love,” he said. Cuomo said New York was looking at an increase of hospitalizations as a result of the virus for the next 21 days until the state reached the “apex.” Until then, Cuomo said the government would work to increase hospital capacity and increase beds, staff, and equipment. Currently, he said, New York had 53,000 hospital beds but predicted that it would soon need 140,000.",Andrew Cuomo Threatens to Shut Down Playgrounds: ‘No More Basketball’,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/andrew-cuomo-threatens-to-shut-down-playgrounds-no-more-basketball/,Breitbart
"Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has denied supporting notorious Chinese tech giant Huawei after his social media post appeared to praise the company in comparison to its American competitor, AT&T. In a statement to Breitbart News, Gingrich said “People have completely reversed the meaning of my tweet I am deeply opposed to Huawei and have spent the last year and a half trying to get an effective us policy on 5G and we still don’t have one.” “Huawei is an enormous threat to our national security, said the former Speaker. “We have to find a strategy to defeat them. I was tweeting about the gap in our big telecoms’ inability to compete.” In a tweet posted yesterday, Gingrich drew attention to Huawei’s distribution of medical equipment to help other countries fight the Wuhan coronavirus, a comment that drew criticism from other conservatives who accused him of praising the widely criticized Chinese telecoms giant. “The contrast between Huawei offering medical equipment to help countries while AT&T has its handout for billions from the taxpayer is very disturbing,” tweeted Gingrich. “Our once great telecommunications companies have lost the entrepreneurial drive that let them lead the world.” The contrast between Huawei offering medical equipment to help countries while AT&T has its handout for billions from the taxpayer is very disturbing.

"A survey released this week from LendEDU reveals that Americans were already on shaky financial ground even before the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The personal finance website recently surveyed 1,000 Americans ages 18 and and older and found that many have credit card and student loan debt and are not saving or investing for their future fiscal security. The survey asked if respondents were “currently investing or saving for retirement through something like a 401K, Roth IRA, or high-yield savings account.” Fifty-seven percent said “no,” while 38 percent said “yes.” Five percent answered, “I’d rather not say.” When asked if they have credit card accounts, 63 percent of respondents said “yes,” while 35 percent answered “no.” Those who answered yes about having an open credit card were asked whether they were worried about paying their credit debt; 54 percent said “yes,” while just 35 percent said “no.” Nearly a quarter of respondents said they have student loan debt, which means a large majority — 75 percent — do not, despite the high priority put on Americans in debt for college in the recent coronavirus relief bill negotiations. Some 63 percent of respondents who do have student loans said they were worried about making their upcoming payment. And more people still have their job compared with those who lost their job, according to the survey. Thirty-five percent answered, “I still have my job,” while six percent said, “I lost my job,” and 13 percent said, “My hours have been partially cut.” But a majority of respondents were worried about their job security — 57 percent of respondents answered “yes” and 36 percent of respondents said “no.” “We found that a substantial proportion of people are worried about their job security, retirement savings, mortgage or student loan payments, and taking on too much credit card debt,” LendEDU wrote about its survey. Respondents were almost evenly split on the question as to whether they were using savings to help them through the crisis — 44 percent said “yes,” while 47 percent said “no.” The survey also found that the average amount of money spent on food and supplies was $335.65.

Co-host Meghan McCain asked, “I know that you have teenage children, and we have all seen these videos of these spring breakers in Florida saying, ‘If I get coronavirus, I get coronavirus.’ Kids in Kentucky are having coronavirus parties. Why do you think this serious message for whatever reason isn’t translating to a lot of — I have been corrected— Generation Z kids, not Millennials?” Cuban said, “You know, kids think they’re, you know, nothing can go wrong, that they’re not vulnerable to anything. I mean, I had to have the conversation with my 16-year-old in particular. I mean, when this all first started happening, it was, like, I’m going to my friend’s house. No, you’re not. They can come over here. No, they can’t. You have to communicate to them and really make it clear. Literally, if one of my kids went out there and were partying in spring break, I would walk up to her and bend her over my knee – I’ve never spanked my kids. Ever!

"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator and White House Coronavirus Task Force team member Seema Verma told Breitbart News Daily how America can “overcome” the coronavirus and what the Donald Trump administration is doing to help Americans throughout the crisis. Verma first spoke to Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow about the CMS’s waiver to expand telehealth, which expands the ability for Americans to talk with their doctor remotely. The CMS administrator said that the telehealth expansion grants Americans greater access to health care and slows the spread of the coronavirus by preventing the spread of the disease to other Americans at the doctor’s office or hospital. Verma said, “It is rapidly expanding across the country under the president’s leadership. One of the things that we know right now is that it’s better for people to stay at home. Those are the recommendations the president and the vice president have put out, 15 days to slow the spread. We’ve said very clearly to individuals, especially those that are elderly with underlying health conditions, that you need to stay home. And so that’s why we’re using telehealth and promoting telehealth because we know that people still need health care. It may be completely unrelated to the coronavirus, you may have heart disease and diabetes, it allows people to communicate with their doctors from the safety of their own home, which is so important.”  She continued, “Also, for individuals that are experiencing flu-like symptoms, it’s better that they have a conversation with their doctor over the phone rather than coming into the office or traveling, they could be sitting in a waiting room and infecting other people. So, what we’re finding since these changes have been made, the president made this announcements a couple of weeks ago, it’s just rapidly expanding across the country. Many healthcare providers were doing some telehealth before, others were not, and that’s why when we put out this announcement, we also said, ‘Hey you don’t need any special equipment’; we’re going to relax some of the rules and regulations so that doctors can just use FaceTime, they can just use Skype to be able to communicate with their patients.”  Verma also urged Americans to help join the cause to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. She said that Americans should wash their hands frequently, stay at home to practice “social distancing,” and to contact their doctor if they believe they have coronavirus symptoms.  Marlow noted that Vice President Mike Pence said during a recent press conference that reportedly 90 percent of people who get tested for coronavirus end up not having coronavirus.  “We are also in flu season, so if you are sick, it may or may not be because of the COVID virus,” Verma noted.  “We’re learning that it’s a sticky virus. It stays on surfaces longer, and I think that we should keep that in mind in terms of the precautions that we’re taking,” she added. Marlow noted that the infection rate for parts of the country other than New York state remains relatively low. Verma attributed that success to the many communities that are following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) recommendation to lower the spread of the coronavirus as well as the Trump administration’s rapid expansion of coronavirus testing. Verma emphasized that the Trump administration has passed a new milestone: It has administered more tests in one week than South Korea has completed during this coronavirus outbreak. She said, “It could be for two reasons: A lot of communities are listening to the recommendations. If you’re taking aggressive mitigation strategies that could have an impact on the rate of spread in communities. The second thing is the testing. We’re still working through the backlog of tests that’s increased dramatically. Yesterday they announced that we have done as many tests as South Korea; we did as many tests last week as South Korea has done in total. That is rapidly increasing, and that’s going to give us a better sense of where the virus is. But I think up until this point, we haven’t had a lot of data and we’re catching up. So, I think it’s rapidly changing, and that’s why the mitigation strategies are so important. Fifteen days to slow the spread, all of the recommendations about staying at home, especially if you’re sick, washing your hands, that’s why all of those things are so important because we want to do better than what the models show us could potentially happen.” Verma’s interview on Breitbart News Daily follows as President Trump said during a Fox News town hall that he would like to start reopening the economy by Easter, which is roughly two weeks away. “I would love to have the country opened up and rearing to go by Easter,” the president said. Verma said that the Trump administration remains optimistic for a quick reopening of the economy; however, the president will only make the decision to do so after it remains safe for Americans to start returning normal life. She said, “I think we’re trying to remain optimistic, but at the end of the day, we’re going to use data to guide our decisions. I think the president has from the very beginning made strong decisions based on data. We had some of the world’s leading experts advising the president, and he’s done a great job of listening to them and making decisions, and he’ll continue to do that. I think Easter is a timeframe. But, at the end of the day, he is going to make decisions based on the data, and he’s going to do what’s best for the American people, making sure that they’re safe.” Verma added that the phase three congressional coronavirus response package “is an important part of our overall response. We have a strong public health response, but also having an economic response is the recognition that so many families across the country are being impacted, small businesses, workers that want to work but are being told to stay at home. So this is an important part of the overall strategy.” Reports have suggested that the anti-malaria drug chloroquine could serve as a potential treatment of the coronavirus. Trump has promoted the use of chloroquine. Verma said that there are many potential treatments of coronavirus; although, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should ensure that any possible treatments are safe and effective against the coronavirus. Verma concluded by urging Americans to take precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “I know it’s hard, but you got to listen to the recommendations, 15 days to slow the spread. It’s very important that we all do our part,” she said. “As Americans, we’re strong; we’re resilient, and this is just a war that we’re fighting that we will successfully overcome.” Breitbart News Daily airs SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

Host Dean Obeidallah asked Gallego how Trump can be believed after the president suggested some parts of the United States could be opened back up around Easter. Gallego said Trump cannot be trusted because he “just talks out of his ass” and hopes things work out like everything has for him in the past. “I mean, he can’t. He just talks out of his ass,” Gallego replied. “And he just hopes that things land in the right way like everything has happened to him in the past. You know, the biggest problem is what he wants to do is to manage the stock market; he doesn’t want to try to manage the health problem that we have right now, the medical problem we have right now.”
Gallego added that Trump does not share the same type of “profound trust” previous presidents had, which he said is “dangerous.” “I don’t believe anything that comes out of his mouth,” he continued. “I’d rather hear it from Fauci or some other governmental official.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sought to insert legislative measures into a coronavirus relief bill to “make it easier to cheat” in elections, explained Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Heritage Foundation’s Election Law Reform Initiative and a senior legal fellow of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Von Spakovsky said, “It’s an attempt to use the coronavirus and the medical crisis we face to force all these changes and election laws the left has been pushing for quite a while, in fact, they took all these provisions out of H.R.1 — which is the first bill the Democrats introduced in the House after they took over when they won the 2018 election, and these rules were all intended to basically make it easier to manipulate elections, and frankly, make it easier to cheat, and they have absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with helping the country deal with the coronavirus.” LISTEN:
 Pelosi proposed a mandate for all states to allow no-excuse absentee voting, including removal of associated voter identification requirements such as the attachment of notarization or witness signatures to absentee ballots. Von Spakovsky explained, “One of the things in this bill that Pelosi has dropped says that not only does every state have to provide no-excuse absentee ballots, but they can’t require notarization or witness signatures of the absentee ballot. They can’t require an ID. Those are all those are all procedures intended to make it easier to submit fraudulent ballots.” Pelosi also wanted states allowing for early voting to begin counting votes 14 days before election day, allowing for manipulation of public opinion via leaks of such information ahead of an election. Such a measure “makes no sense whatsoever, unless you want to be able to manipulate election results,” determined von Spakovsky. “This federal law would require every state to start processing and scanning ballots 14 days before election day,” stated von Spakovsky. “In other words, they would start tabulating the votes before everyone has even voted. Now, what do you think is going to happen if that information has been leaked out to candidates who, for example, the early early accounting shows are losing? They’re going to use that information to try to change what’s happening in the election or some voters who haven’t yet voted may decide, ‘Well, there’s no point in going to the polls. My candidate is losing.'” Von Spakovsky added, “There’s a good reason why states today say we’re not going to start counting all the ballots until the end of election day, and it’s to prevent information from getting out that could change the election results. … This is a way of trying to manipulate election results and why in the world put this in a bill having to do with the coronavirus?” Pelosi tried to initiate online voting, von Spakovsky noted. “There’s a reason we don’t have internet voting and other things like that, because the amount of fraud and hacking that occurs on the internet is huge, but [Nancy Pelosi] is basically saying we want to be able to allow that in the election process,” von Spakovsky remarked. Pelosi wanted California’s allowing of vote harvesting to become a national standard, von Spakovsky stated, which would allow political candidates, campaign workers, and others directly invested in electoral outcomes to collect and submit absentee and mail-in ballots. Von Spakovsky said, “This bill of Pelosi’s mandates that states allow vote harvesting. It mandates that they allow candidates and political consultants and others to be able to pick up absentee ballots, which is just foolish unless you want to put ballots in the hands of people who have a stake in the outcome, and then they’ll have an opportunity to alter ballots or toss out the ballots [from] people who they know are going to be voting for candidates they don’t want to have win.” “We’ve seen cases … from all over the country involving absentee ballot fraud and this makes it easier to commit that,” determined von Spakovsky. Pelosi intended to prohibit states from requiring the provision and verification of a person’s social security number during voter registration. “There’s a handful of states that require you, when you register to vote, to provide your full social security number,” noted von Spakovsky. “That makes it easier to identify voters and make sure they haven’t registered more than once or making other mistakes with them. This federal law bans states from doing, so why in the world would [Nancy Pelosi] do that unless they’re trying to make it easier for fraud to occur in the election process?” Requiring states to allow online voter registration is another method proposed by Pelosi that would make electoral fraud easier, noted von Spakovsky. “There are some states now that do allow online registration, but only if the state already has a record on you,” explained von Spakovsky, noting that such states require prior in-person verification of a person’s identity via the provision of a driver’s license or other form of identification. Von Spakovsky went on, “In those states — Georgia is one of them — you can then go online and register using that prior information the state has on you … but what [Nancy Pelosi] is saying here is states have to allow anybody to register online. Well, when you do that, how in the world is the state going to be able to authenticate that you’re a real person or that you really live where you claim to say you’re living? There’s no way to do that.” Mansour quipped, “So basically, registering to vote is about as simple as subscribing to the New York Times website. Just fill in your name and your email address and you’re fine!” Pelosi and Democrats seek to eliminate states’ abilities to verify the identity of voters, von Spakovsky said. “When it comes to voter registration and voting by absentee ballot, they’re getting rid of absolutely every ability states have to check the accuracy of the of the information they’re receiving, and to make sure you’re real person, you really exist, [and] you really live where where you say you live,” remarked von Spakovsky. “All these things that are needed to maintain the security and integrity of the election process, they’re trying to get rid of all of that.” Von Spakovsky concluded, “[Democrats] see this as the key to winning elections by any means possible, and that’s why they want this. If they can use this to cheat, to manipulate election results so that they win and they’re able to retain and gain power, well then all the other things they want, like the Green New Deal and everything else, they’ll be able to do it because they’re going to be in office.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

"Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) wants policymakers to look beyond solely focusing on coronavirus in making decisions that will lead to a decline in economic activity, which could hurt society in the long run. During an interview with Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Brooks said if it were up to him, he would give cautionary advice on the COVID-19 outbreak but have an “inclination” to trust people to act in their best interest. However, he said he was reluctant to call into question decisions made by governors and mayors restricting liberties given the severity and the unknowns related to the pandemic. “If I were the governor of a state, governor of New York or California or any state, or mayor — I’d give people as much cautionary advice as I could give,” Brooks said. “Wash your hands, work at home if your work will allow you to do so. But it is your choice, your freedom, your liberty. You make this decision because it involves you and your life. That would be my inclination is to trust the people to do what is in their best interest, which collectively is in society’s best interest.” “However, I really don’t feel comfortable saying that those governors and those mayors around the country who have been much more aggressive in restricting the ability of people to work, by way of example, that they are wrong because this is new,” he continued. “We haven’t had something like this since 1918 and 1920 with the Spanish flu. And although it is kind of like this, it is not the same as the coronavirus because we are so much more medically advanced now. Society has changed so much over the last hundred years. While we’ve seen something like this in the past, it’s not the same. It is new. So a lot of elected officials have to make some very very tough decisions.” Brooks mentioned some of the drawbacks to starving economic activity, particularly as it could impact some government services that are financed from tax revenue generated from that economic activity. “I would just caution them, and particularly I would caution the medical profession — look, guys, we know where you’re coming from,” he said. “We know the restraints you want to impose. But also understand that we have two bad choices. And it may be that what you’re asking us to do is going to cost more people’s lives than the coronavirus. That’s where we need more people that understand the dynamics of economics and the cascading effect of economic decisions and how our economy also impacts how many people live, how many people die, what kind of comforts we have while we’re alive, how long we’re going to live.” “The economy generates the wealth that allows us to have the health care system that is better than any other on the planet,” Brooks continued. “That allows us to have law enforcement, penitentiaries where we can put deadly criminals who we don’t want on the street threatening the lives of others. It allows us to have safer roads that we have fewer people die in automotive wrecks. It is our economy that allows us to have better food, better shelter, better clothing — all of which results in longer life and fewer deaths. I don’t think that we have enough mayors and governors, and I don’t think we have enough people in the medical profession who understand economic dynamics well enough to properly balance the two. They’re all focused on coronavirus almost to the exclusion of the adverse effects on the economy will have on lives in America.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","Mo Brooks Warns Governors, Mayor, Medical Professionals Against Focusing on Coronavirus ‘to the Exclusion’ of the Economy",2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/25/mo-brooks-warns-governors-mayor-medical-professionals-against-focusing-on-coronavirus-to-the-exclusion-of-the-economy/,Breitbart
"The Senate passed a substantial emergency relief bill on Wednesday night that would provide aid to small businesses, hospitals, and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The Senate passed H.R. 748, the CARES Act, with 96 votes in favor of the bill and no senators opposed to the legislation. The legislation featured unanimous support from Republicans and Democrats. The legislation required 60 votes to pass through the Senate. The Senate coronavirus package costs roughly $2 trillion and is approximately 880-pages long. The Senate shot down an amendment to the bill sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE), which would reverse the bill’s generous unemployment benefits. Sens. Sasse, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Rick Scott (R-FL) contended that the legislation would incentivize Americans not to work. The amendment required 60 votes to pass through the chamber. Sasse’s amendment was shot down with 48 votes in favor and 48 against the measure. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rebuffed the Republican senators’ concerns over the bill, contending this will help those who involuntarily lost their jobs. “I don’t think it will create incentives. Most Americans, what they want, they want to keep their jobs,” Mnuchin said. “We need to get this money into the American economy and American workers, that’s the importance of this,” he added. The Senate Cares Act would provide most Americans $1,200 per individual, $500 for most children, and establish a several hundred billion dollar lending aid program for businesses, cities and states, as well as aid for small businesses. The bill also omits many Democrat requests such as mandatory early voting, ballot harvesting, requirements that federal agencies analyze their use of “minority banks,” and provisions to curb airline emissions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor before the vote that the chamber “will stay nimble” to combat the coronavirus. He added that there would be no more votes in the Senate until April 20. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) said in a statement after the bill passed through the Senate: As this COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, I’ve continued to listen to Iowans from all sectors of our economy, and there has been one resounding message: we need relief, and we need it now. After heeding these calls, I pushed my colleagues to take swift, bold action to deliver immediate aid to folks in Iowa, and across the country. And thankfully, we’ve done that. From Phase 1, where we bolstered our state and local response efforts; to Phase 2 where we provided paid sick leave and free testing; and now, to Phase 3 where we’ve come to the aid of America’s workforce and those in our health care industry on the front lines of this pandemic. “Now, the House must do their job, pass this bipartisan bill quickly, and get it to President Trump’s desk. We don’t have time for delay; Iowans need this aid right now,” she added. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said after CARES Act passed: Communities across Florida and our nation are reeling from this unprecedented crisis, and today the Senate acted on an unprecedented response to provide relief to Americans, small businesses, and our economy. Our bipartisan small business package, which was included, will provide emergency relief so that millions of American workers can keep their jobs and millions of small businesses can stay open. As our nation works to contain the spread of the coronavirus, I remain in close contact with the Trump Administration and Governor DeSantis to ensure that Florida has the resources it needs during this public health crisis. “The Coronavirus epidemic has damaged our physical and our economic health. This bill supports the economic health of individuals, families ,and employers. It also advances the fight to make us safe from the disease,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA). The Senate appeared poised over the weekend to pass the legislation; however, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) left the negotiating table at the last minute to craft her own legislation. After many days of negotiation with Senate Republicans and the White House, Pelosi agreed to support the Senate proposal. Now that the bill has passed through the Senate, the House will take up the bill on Friday. McConnell delivered an impassioned speech before the vote on the Senate floor on Wednesday about how the nation will defeat the coronavirus. “Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast, and they did.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"The Pentagon announced Wednesday its first case of coronavirus found in the building, involving a U.S. Marine. “A U.S. Marine stationed at the Pentagon tested positive for COVID-19 on March 24,” the Pentagon announced in a statement Wednesday evening. “The Marine is in isolation at his home and will undergo further assessment by health professionals. His last day in the Pentagon was March 13,” it said. The Pentagon statement said the Marine followed U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and Department of Defense directives by isolating himself when an immediate family member began to show symptoms. It said once the Marine became ill, he contacted his assigned medical facility. “His workspace has been cleaned by a Pentagon response team and a thorough contact investigation is underway to mitigate risk and preserve the health of the workforce at the Pentagon,” it said. It is not clear yet where the Marine works inside the building. The Pentagon is one of the largest office buildings in the world and houses thousands of offices that keep the enormous defense enterprise running. The building has its own post office, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office, a CVS Pharmacy, several retail stores, and multiple food courts. Defense Secretary Mark Esper raised the building’s health protection condition (HPCON) to “high” on Wednesday morning, which initiated enhanced screening measures. As of Wednesday at 5 a.m. EDT, there were 227 cases of coronavirus found among active-duty members of the military.

"Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, indicated on Wednesday that novel coronavirus infection rate predictions suggesting the deadly and highly contagious disease will infect about half the U.S. population are overblown and needlessly frightening the American people. She indicated that the U.S. response, including the actions of the federal government and the public, would prevent the infection rate from reaching those levels. The only way the coronavirus would infect about half of the population is if people do nothing, and “every American is doing something,” she said. Her comments came during the daily coronavirus press briefing at the White House. She said: [T]hose projections … that implied that 60 percent or 50 percent of the population would get infected, I want to be very clear. The only way that happens is this virus remains continuously moving through populations in this cycle, and the fall cycle, and another cycle. So, that’s the three cycles with nothing being done. … You can get to those numbers if you have zero controls and you do nothing. And we know that every American is doing something. “I think the [infection rate] numbers that have been put out there are actually very frightening to people,” Dr. Birx declared.

"Bringing pharmaceutical production back to the United States would create more than 800,000 American jobs, economists say. A study by the Coalition for a Prosperous America’s Steven Byers and Jeff Ferry reveals that the U.S. could add hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs for American citizens and reduce its dependence on foreign countries like China if it reshored all pharmaceutical production. “The US is dependent on China for over one-third of all the antibiotics we import, and in the case of many generic drugs, we are completely dependent on China,” the economists wrote. “We found that an ambitious but realistic reshoring program could create 804,000 US jobs and add $200 billion to annual GDP in the first year,” they continued. “The benefits in terms of security of supply are separate, and in times like the present, critically important.” Currently, according to the study, about 80 percent of pharmaceuticals imported to the U.S. arrive from ten foreign countries — including Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, India, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, United Kingdom, and Japan. (Coalition for a Prosperous America) (Coalition for a Prosperous America) This pharmaceutical import data, though, does not include the ingredients of necessary drugs that are imported — specifically from China. Overall, about 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients imported to the U.S. arrive from China and India. Similarly, about 95 percent of ibuprofen and 70 percent of acetaminophen imported to the U.S. arrive from China. In response to the coronavirus crisis, President Donald Trump has called for an American independence agenda across the board to prevent the U.S. from ever again being reliant on foreign countries for necessary imports and supplies. “We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival.

"A majority of Republican Senator Richard Burr’s constituents in North Carolina believe he should resign for selling upwards of $1.72 million in stock ahead of the coronavirus pandemic. A new survey released by Public Policy Polling on Tuesday revealed that 50 percent of North Carolina voters think Burr should resign, while only 24 percent believe he should remain in public office. The sentiment in favor of resignation transcended ideological lines with 63 percent and 53 percent of independents in favor. Even members of the senator’s own political party seemed divided on the issue, with 31 percent of Republicans saying the senator should resign, while 38 percent believed he should not. The poll is the first to come out since it emerged that Burr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, unloaded thousands of dollars worth of stock less than a week before the stock market sharply dropped because of the coronavirus pandemic. The senator’s timely sell-off, which occurred as the Intelligence Committee was receiving nearly daily briefings on the virus, netted between $628,000 and $1.72 million. Most of the shares were in hospitality companies, like Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Hilton, that took an especially hard hit as coronavirus travel restrictions went into place. Many are now worth a fraction of the price of when Burr opted to sell. When news of the sell-off broke, speculation began to mount that the senator had acted on inside information to protect his assets, given that he was privy to confidential briefings on the pandemic. If true, Burr could potentially be found in violation of the STOCK Act, which prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit by lawmakers. Burr, for his part, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. In a statement issued last week, the senator admitted that, while the selloff was motivated by the coronavirus, he did not act on information available only to members of congress. “I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13,” Burr said, urging the Senate Ethics Committee to launch an investigation into the sale. Voters, though, seem not to be convinced of Burr’s innocence. When informed by the Public Policy Polling survey about the timing of Burr’s stock sale, 69 percent said they had “very serious” concerns. Similarly, support for Burr’s resignation increased by 60 percent among North Carolina voters when informed of the matter.",North Carolina Poll: Majority of Voters Say Burr Should Resign for Coronavirus Stock Selloff,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/north-carolina-poll-majority-of-voters-say-burr-should-resign-for-coronavirus-stock-selloff/,Breitbart

"A coalition of 14 Republican and Democrat Senators is pleading with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide an early release to elderly felons in federal prison in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

Conditions of confinement do not afford individuals the opportunity to take proactive steps to protect themselves, and prisons often create the ideal environment for the transmission of contagious disease. [Emphasis added] For these reasons, it is important that consistent with the law and taking into account public safety and health concerns, that the most vulnerable inmates are released or transferred to home confinement, if possible. [Emphasis added] The letter requests the DOJ to “quickly transfer non-violent offenders who are at high risk for suffering complications from COVID-19 to home confinement” and asks that the compassion release program be more broadly defined so that thousands of more inmates can be given early release. “According to a report recently filed by BOP, in 2019, 1,735 requests for release were initiated by or on behalf of inmates, of which 1,501 were denied by wardens and 226 were forwarded to the BOP Director,” the letter states. “Of these 226, BOP approved only 55 requests and denied 171 requests.

"America First—Finally  Much good can come out of World War V (“V” for “Virus,” in the coinage of Silicon Valley techie Balaji Srinivasan).  Yes, we will mourn the loss of life, yes, we will regret the personal and social disruption, and yes, we will have to work hard to restore our economic vitality. And we’ll have to work even harder to restore a proper sense of justice in this country, where the heroes of World War V—the “thin white line,” as well as others who fought to save us—receive a larger share of the rewards and benefits than they have heretofore.    We can do all these things, and more, if we follow the right vision and the right leadership. Indeed, history shows that we can come back stronger than ever—but only if we make the right moves.    For instance, we can start by moving to reclaim our health supply chains from their current dependence—that is, their end points in the People’s Republic of China. It was foolish, in the extreme, for past White Houses and Congresses to let American health companies outsource their production to China. And yet that’s exactly what happened, while Washington, DC, was focused on various Middle Eastern follies.  As a result, today, the U.S. makes pitifully little of what it truly needs—and that’s why we are confronted with humiliating headlines such as this, seen in the March 13 New York Times: “The World Needs Masks.  China Makes Them—But Has Been Hoarding Them.” As the article detailed: China made half the world’s masks before the coronavirus emerged there, and it has expanded production nearly 12-fold since then.  But it has claimed mask factory output for itself.  Purchases and donations also brought China a big chunk of the world’s supply from elsewhere. The Times is too polite to come out and say so, but it seems obvious that the Chinese are trying to corner the market on protective face masks—leaving us to wonder why.   Yet now finally, after 30 years of globalist sleepwalking under both Democrats and Republicans, America is starting to wake up. And two of the leading Wide Awakes are Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, and Rep. Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin; they have jointly put forth a bill in Congress: The Protecting our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain from China Act.  On March 25, Cotton and Gallagher published an op-ed in which they declared, “Our bill would require federal entities like the Department of Defense, VA hospitals, Medicare and Medicaid to cut off purchases of drugs with Chinese ingredients no later than 2025”—with the idea being that if those huge purchasers of medicines phased out their China purchases, the rest of the U.S. market would follow. In other words, American would independent of China, the country whose propaganda ministry recently crowed that we would “sink into the hell of the novel coronavirus.” In other words, Red China is exactly the sort of country we should not be relying on—for anything.  Still, the Cotton-Gallagher legislation is so upsetting to the globalist order that we should expect half the lobbyists in D.C. to oppose the bill. And yet the problem of our dependence on Big Panda is so severe that it’s likely that the goals of Cotton and Gallagher will be realized, one way or another, soon enough.  To be sure, from the point of view of a well-fed incumbent politician, it’s certainly nice to be funded and lunched by lobbyists and PACs working for globalist clients—and yet for the individual pol, it’s actually nicer to get re-elected.  And that suggests movement in the direction pointed to by Cotton and Gallagher.  That is, in light of the gathering crises over both corona and China, few politicians will wish to be seen as in the pocket of either the corporate outsourcers or of the Chinese.  According to Cotton and Gallagher, the problem is this:  Today, most active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used for drugs in the United States are made in China, including 95% of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, 70% of acetaminophen, and 40-45% of penicillin. Of this litany of outsourced health necessities, the most poignant is penicillin. It was, after all, penicillin that helped us win World War Two. So if we see the Good War as the still-abiding moral heart of the modern-day worker-soldier-first-responder coalition—and we rightly should—then we must study our successes in World War Two, seeking to emulate them whenever possible.   Penicillin  Many people know that penicillin notatum was discovered accidentally, back in 1928, by a British doctor and bacteriologist, Alexander Fleming. It seems that Fleming had absent-mindedly left a piece of bread out in the open, where it grew moldy and thereby contaminated one of his laboratory’s petri dishes. And yet fortunately, Fleming was alert enough to notice that the bread-mold was killing the bacteria around it. As Fleming later wrote: When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer.  But I guess that was exactly what I did. Yet the story of penicillin is far more complicated than just a single serendipity of science. Fleming published his findings in 1929, and spent the next half-decade trying to produce penicillin on a larger scale. Yet he was disappointed to realize such production was arduously slow. And so, by 1935, unable to find research help, he had mostly given up on his effort to ramp up production.  British bacteriologist and Nobel laureate Sir Alexander Fleming in his laboratory at the Wright-Fleming Institute, St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington in 1951. (Baron/Getty Images) In this photo taken on Thursday, February 16, 2017, a capsule of original penicillin mold from which Alexander Fleming made the drug known as penicillin on view at Bonham’s auction house in London. (Alastair Grant/AP Photo) In the meantime, Germany, Britain’s once and future enemy, was the world’s leader in life-saving medicines. Going back deep into the 19th century, Germans had been at the vanguard of chemistry and industrial chemicals. And out of that abundance of chemical knowledge, beginning in the early 1930s, they created a whole category of synthetic antibiotics, containing the molecule sulfanilamide. These “sulfa drugs” worked well—and saved many lives. In fact, had Hitler not been so crazy and warmongering, it’s entirely possible that German synthetics would have continued to be the world’s standard for anti-bacterial medicine.   Yet in 1939, when Hitler started World War Two, the British realized that since they would no longer have access to German medicines, they would need to create them on their own. After all, they knew from past battlefield experience that infections associated with war wounds often killed more soldiers than the wounds themselves.    So now British government officials took a closer look at what Fleming had been trying to accomplish with his natural antibiotic, penicillin. And soon enough, they concluded that the efficacy of the natural antibiotic was, in fact, superior to that of any synthetic antibiotic. (This is not an environmental argument, incidentally, but rather, an empirical argument; the practical scientist has to figure out what kind of medicine works best in any given situation.)  In other words, having been thrown into a sink-or-swim situation by the onset of the war, the British eyed an opportunity to do more than swim—they could build a better boat.  Yet the British also knew that they lacked the industrial capacity to crank out penicillin in the needed quantities—only the Americans had that capacity. Thus in 1940–41, the Brits began collaborating closely with the Yanks, working to develop a joint plan for mass penicillin production. The British were already fighting Nazi Germany, and the Americans figured that soon enough, they, too, would be in the war.    In the words of author Lauren Belfer: The United States government took over the production, and penicillin was made under the supervision of the same group that was supervising the Manhattan Project for the atomic bomb. The comrades-in-medicine ended up working together at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, where they experimented on ways of accelerating penicillin production.  For instance, a USDA official, Dr. Andrew Moyer, figured out that lactose was superior to glucose as a production feedstock. And superior production was what they got. American penicillin output was essentially zero in 1941, and yet in the first half of 1942, 400 million units had been manufactured. And by 1944, it was abundant enough that all GI’s were issued penicillin in their kits. Indeed, by 1945, Uncle Sam was producing 650 billion units a month.  Using 180,000 units of anti-toxin penicillin and sulpha diazine, members of the U.S. Army Medical Corps treat a German prisoner at an evacuation hospital in Brittany, France, on September 26, 1944 for gas gangrene, which has set in a rifle bullet wound which shattered the patient’s thigh bone above the knee. (George Greb/AP Photo) Yet to be precise, the government wasn’t producing penicillin at all—it was merely buying it in vast quantities. The actual leaders in production were Merck, E. R. Squibb & Sons, Charles Pfizer & Co., and Lederle Laboratories; these were later joined by Eli Lilly, Abbott Laboratories, Upjohn, and Parke, Davis. In other words, American capitalism was all-in.   So we can see that in a way, it was actually a good thing that the Anglo-Americans no longer had access to German sulfa drugs. Forced to rely on ourselves, we produced a better product—in this case, natural was better than synthetic.   History is like that sometimes: When you have to figure it out for yourself, as opposed to simply relying on the work of others, you often end up doing a better job.   Thanks to penicillin, America’s war-wounded were more likely to survive than Germany’s war-wounded. And that’s one reason why we defeated Hitler in just three-and-a-half years.   Indeed, during the war, we found that different companies were actually working with slightly different strains of penicillin; the cells had simply mutated, spontaneously, in the labs and production sites. This diversity of strains helped give rise to the thousands of different antibiotics that we can use to heal today.   Lessons for Today In the summarizing words of the University of Utah’s Dr. Roswell Quinn, writing in the March 2013 issue of The American Journal of Public Health, “The U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s involvement in antibiotics originated in a government-sponsored project during World War II.”   Quinn emphasized that “wartime requirements induced scientific collaboration, dramatic acceleration of scientific innovation, and technical standardization.” As he then detailed, the Pentagon’s Office of Scientific Research and Development coordinated a total of 57 research contracts for preliminary studies of penicillin, as well as clinical trials and other kinds of research.  And in the meantime, a second defense agency, the War Production Board—run by William S. Knudsen, cited here at Breitbart News just the other day—worked with 21 companies, five academic groups, and several government agencies to mass-produce penicillin.   All this technical and industrial effort, of course, created a large cadre of trained researchers and skilled production workers—and so even during the war, it was possible to see positive implications for the post-war economy.   In Quinn’s words, the long-term economic benefits were, indeed, profound:   This environment of exchange was profitable and conferred an array of noneconomic assets on industrial participants. Such scientific and technological assets propelled the U.S. pharmaceutical industry beyond previous inefficiencies and transformed it into one of the country’s most successful sectors. It’s this successful history from the 20th century that Cotton and Gallagher are summoning in the 21st century. As we have seen, once American ingenuity is unleashed, there’s no telling where it will end up.    So it’s little wonder that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already noisily upset at the prospect of America reclaiming its health-production sovereignty, tweeting on March 17, “Trying to move medical supply chains back to the US from China is unrealistic and unhelpful. A wrong remedy for #COVID19 pandemic.” Yes, of course, the Chinese want to keep us weak and dependent on them. Yet with far-seeing leaders such as Cotton and Gallagher on the mission, we won’t let that miserable status quo long continue.  Yes, we have been hit hard by the coronavirus, and yet we all recall that we were hit hard, too, on Pearl Harbor—and we came back for the win in World War Two. And so just as celebrated V.E. (Victory in Europe) Day in 1945, someday we’ll celebrate V.C. Day. ",Pinkerton: Tom Cotton’s Idea to Insource U.S. Pharmaceuticals Echoes One of Our Great Successes in World War Two,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/25/pinkerton-tom-cottons-idea-to-insource-u-s-pharmaceuticals-echoes-one-of-our-great-successes-in-world-war-two/,Breitbart

Forty-four of these 2,499 patients died. None of those who died were under the age of 20, nine were adults aged 20 to 64, 20 were adults aged 65 to 84, and 15 were adults aged 85 and older. (Note: 87 Americans died of coronavirus by March 16,  Worldometers reported, meaning only slightly more than half of those deaths were included in this CDC study.) Here is how that broke down as a mortality rate by specific age group when the total number of deaths in the age group is the numerator and the total number of cases in the age group is the denominator: The CDC study referred to these mortality rates as a lower bound, because they used the total number of cases in each age group as the denominator. It also included data on what it considered an “upper bound” for mortality rates when the denominator referred only to “cases with known information on each outcome.” Using these “upper bound” denominators, the mortality rates increased in each age group, ranging from 0.2 percent in the 20 to 44 age group all the way up to 27.3 percent in the 85 and older age group. The report added: [Between  February 12 and March 16], 4,226 COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States; 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged ≥85 years. These findings are similar to data from China, which indicated >80% of deaths occurred among persons aged ≥60 years (3). These preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with COVID-19. In contrast, persons aged ≤19 years appear to have milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported to date in the United States in this age group. Given the spread of COVID-19 in many U.S. communities, CDC continues to update current recommendations and develop new resources and guidance, including for adults aged ≥65 years as well as those involved in their care In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar highlighted the significance of mortality rates in the president’s plans to re-open the country for business: The data that the president and his team of doctors and scientists will consider as they make their decision on reopening America, Azar said, is most importantly mortality rates of the disease—but also infection rates and other data. “Dr. Birx said yesterday at the press conference the most important data point you look at that is essentially irrefutable is mortality data,” Azar said. “How many people are dying from Covid-19? That will be your firmest bit of data in assessing the situation. You will also look at infection rates and new cases, but the problem there is you never can test everybody. So the testing gives you an indicator and gives you a trend, but it is certainly less secure information than mortality data that you would look at.” Trump, later on Tuesday after Azar’s interview with Breitbart News, said during a Fox News town hall that he hopes to reopen much of the United States by Easter Sunday, April 12. Trump, with Dr. Birx standing alongside him on Monday evening in the White House briefing room, began signaling the reopening of the country. He seems to have an ally in New York’s Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has also voiced support for reopening the country. The notion that public policy and government actions should be influenced by the differing mortality rates by age groups has been advanced recently by several doctors and scientists, including Dr. David L. Katz, president of True Health Initiative and the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, who set forth this argument in an op-ed published in the New York Times last week: The clustering of complications and death from Covid-19 among the elderly and chronically ill, but not children (there have been only very rare deaths in children), suggests that we could achieve the crucial goals of social distancing — saving lives and not overwhelming our medical system — by preferentially protecting the medically frail and those over age 60, and in particular those over 70 and 80, from exposure. Why does this matter? I am deeply concerned that the social, economic and public health consequences of this near total meltdown of normal life — schools and businesses closed, gatherings banned — will be long lasting and calamitous, possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself. The stock market will bounce back in time, but many businesses never will. The unemployment, impoverishment and despair likely to result will be public health scourges of the first order. As President Trump develops his plans to re-launch the economy in the near future as the coronavirus pandemic continues, mortality rates by age group will likely be key facts under consideration by both public health experts and economists.",CDC Report: Coronavirus Mortality Rates in US Increase Dramatically by Age Group,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/cdc-report-coronavirus-mortality-rates-in-us-increase-dramatically-by-age-group/,Breitbart
"The Army is reaching out to its retired community for volunteers in the fight against coronavirus — particularly those with medical experience, according to an email sent to retirees and obtained by Breitbart News. The Army has begun deploying medical units and field hospitals to New York and Washington, and will likely send more that will require more staff. While military leaders say they have enough medical staff and resources to take care of their own force, they have indicated that medical staffing is a limiting factor when providing additional resources to support the civilian population. The email reads: The U.S. Army is reaching out to gauge the interest of our retired officers, noncommissioned officers and Soldiers who would be willing to assist with the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic response effort should their skills and expertise be required.

"Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s efforts to close all gun stores in the county have been suspended pending Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) reconsideration of what constitutes an “essential business.” On March 24, 2020, Fox 11 reported Villanueva’s order to close gun stores. The sheriff attempted to justify the store closures by intimating that all the first-time gun buyers emerging amid the coronavirus crisis create a perilous situation: “I’m a supporter of the 2nd amendment, I’m a gun owner myself, but now you have the mixture of people that are not formerly gun owners and you have a lot more people at home and anytime you introduce a firearm in a home, from what I understand from CDC studies, it increases fourfold the chance that someone is gonna get shot.” On March 25, 2020, the Los Angles Times reported that Villanueva’s effort to close gun stores was halted by news that Newsom would be rethinking whether such stores fell under the “essential business” protections.

"The Senate released the text for the $2 trillion coronavirus package Wednesday evening that would provide immediate economic relief to small businesses and Americans. The Senate will likely vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus package on Wednesday night after the chamber votes on an amendment offered by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE). The amendment would bar Americans from getting more from unemployment than they would while they are employed. The measure is supported by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Rick Scott (R-FL) and will require 60 votes to attach the amendment to the bill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rebuffed the Republican senators’ concerns over the bill, contending this will help those who involuntarily lost their jobs. “I don’t think it will create incentives, most Americans, what they want, they want to keep their jobs,” Mnuchin said. “We need to get this money into the American economy and American workers, that’s the importance of this,” he added. It will likely fail to pass. After the Senate votes on the amendment, the Senate will consider the coronavirus legislation, which will only require a simple majority, or 51 votes, to pass through the chamber. After the Senate presumably passes the legislation, the House will move to pass the bill on Thursday quickly. The Senate’s advancement of the legislation follows as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have spent five days negotiating over the historically large emergency package. The coronavirus package contains direct cash payments to most Americans, a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, aid to state and local governments, and support for hospitals strained by the coronavirus. McConnell delivered an impassioned speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday about how the country will defeat the coronavirus. “Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast, and they did.” Read the $2 trillion Senate coronavirus package here.

"Dr. Anthony Fauci apologized after snapping at a reporter on Wednesday who questioned him about the credibility of the World Health Organization. Real Clear Politics reporter Philip Wegmann questioned Fauci whether the World Health Organization led by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was too deferential to China. “Tedros, outstanding person,” Fauci said, noting that he had known him for a long time. Fauci said that for many years, the WHO had experienced problems, but that the current General Secretary was doing a good job. “Obviously over the years, anyone who says that the WHO has not had problems has not been watching the WHO,” Fauci said. “But I think that under his leadership, they’ve done very well. He has been all over this.” But when Wegmann repeated his question about the WHO praising China for its transparency, Fauci grew irritated. “I can’t comment on that because I don’t have a viewpoint into it, I don’t even know what your question is,” he snapped, and walked away from the briefing podium. “Welcome to the club,” President Donald Trump grinned. Later Fauci returned to the podium to address his conversation with the WHO and apologized to the reporter. “I want to apologize for my curt response to you when you asked about the China deal,” Fauci said. “I shouldn’t have done that, that’s not my style.”",Dr. Anthony Fauci Apologizes for Snapping at Reporter for WHO Question,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/dr-anthony-fauci-apologizes-for-snapping-at-reporter-for-who-question/,Breitbart
"If, as the evidence suggests, the Chinese virus is enormously dangerous to people with certain medical conditions and those over 70 years old, but a much smaller danger to those under 70, then shutting down the entire country indefinitely is probably a bad idea. But even when the time is right — by Easter, June or the fall — there will be no one to stop the quarantine because the media will continue to hype every coronavirus death, as if these are the only deaths that count and the only deaths that were preventable.What mayor, governor or president will be willing to take the blame for causing a coronavirus death?We’ll get no BREAKING NEWS alerts for the regular flu deaths (so far this season, more than 23,000, compared to 533 from the coronavirus).Nor for the more than 3,000 people who die every day of heart disease or cancer. No alerts for the hundreds who die each day from car accidents, illegal aliens and suicide.Only coronavirus deaths are considered newsworthy.We’re told by the “Quarantine Everybody” crowd: Listen to the scientists! Unfortunately, most of the “scientists” they present to us are lawyers. (How did Robert Reich, Donna Shalala and Ron Klain become medical professionals?)Also, the scientists disagree.Just as, I assume, they did in 1976, when epidemiologists warned of another 1918 Spanish flu pandemic after a few young Army recruits died of swine flu at Fort Dix in New Jersey. Eight months later, the federal government launched a mandatory swine flu vaccination program.About a quarter of the country was vaccinated before the program was abruptly shut down. No pandemic had materialized. The virus infected a few people, then vanished. But directly as a result of receiving the vaccine, dozens of Americans died and several hundred acquired Guillain-Barre syndrome.The scientists also disagreed in the 1980s, when the media and government went into overdrive to scare us all about AIDS.

"Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Americans Wednesday to prepare for the second round of coronavirus, even though they would succeed against the virus. Fauci said that in the Southern Hemisphere, officials were starting to see the virus appearing as they started back into their winter season. “If in fact they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we’ll get a cycle around the second time,” he warned during a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday. Fauci said that the United States needed to continue working on a vaccine so that they would be prepared to fight the virus if it came back seasonally. “I know we will be successful in putting this down now, but we really need to be prepared for the next cycle,” Fauci said. He said his Chinese colleagues on the World Health Organization call told him that they were concerned about the virus coming back, even after they beat it back. “They have very very few cases, but what they’re starting to see, as they’re relaxing the constraints on travel, that they’re getting imported cases,” Fauci said. He also said that Chinese officials warned America to be aware of the virus coming back. “I think we’re going to have to remember we don’t want to import cases in,” Fauci said. He also cautioned that even though the curve of the outbreak finally peaked, it did not mean that the fight was over. “That doesn’t mean you declare victory when it does that, but at least you’re on the way that you want to go,” he said.",Dr. Anthony Fauci: Get Ready for Second Round of Coronavirus,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/25/https-www-breitbart-com-politics-2020-03-25-dr-anthony-fauci-apologizes-for-snapping-at-reporter-for-who-question/,Breitbart
"Wednesday on MSNBC, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) accused President Donald Trump of putting people’s lives at risk by “denying the severity” of the coronavirus outbreak. Anchor Ari Melber said, “Let’s begin with what many viewers have just seen, which was a presentation by the president making all kinds of arguments including continuing to hype or float the idea of getting back to normal soon and his own experts at that very podium, the ones you’ve been hearing from in Congress as well, who seem to be trying to condition all of us for a long and careful road ahead. Your view, your reaction.” Booker said, “Well, again, you said it, we need to be looking at science and data and not looking at wishful thinking. We need leaders that can speak in a sober manner and a candid way to folks. We know, looking at other countries, there has not been another country that has suddenly just come out of this in a matter of weeks. Even Wuhan still has many people in China under some sense of lockdown or some sense of sheltering in place or social distancing. So we have to be candid with folks and deal with what’s coming.” He continued, “Now, the challenge for me as a senator from New Jersey, a state that has the second most cases, the state that is in the New York metropolitan area, is that we do not have the resources right now. There’s a lot of heroic actions going on from our governor to hospital officials to expand capacity, but we need more help and support from the federal government.” He added, “And to have a president who is standing in the most powerful position in the land, whose not only not using his power like the Defense Production Act, but is actually denying the severity of what we’re facing, it’s unacceptable, and it’s putting people’s lives at risk. We must get more ventilators, more protective equipment, and do more to support our hospitals. I’m very grateful about the bill that I hope we’ll be voting on very soon in the United States Senate.

"A top adviser to Joe Biden repeatedly described the Coronavirus as “Wuhan virus” earlier this year, around the same time the former vice president was castigating political opponents for doing likewise. Ronald Klain, who led the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and is now an adviser to Biden’s presidenital campaign, took to social media in January to give his thoughts on the burgeoning pandemic. In a series of posts, Klain openly referred to the contagion as the “Wuhan virus,” a term many, including his boss, would later claim has racial and xenophobic overtones. “The level of concern over the ‘Wuhan virus’ is escalating quickly here in the US and globally,” Klain wrote on Jan. 20th. “Is the Trump admin equipped to manage this? Lots of great career people in the agencies — but something like this requires leadership at the top.” In another tweet sent the following day, Klain again referred to the virus by the city in China from which it originated, when warning that a public health crisis lay ahead. “We don’t yet know how large a the ‘Wuhan’ Coronavirus poses,” Klain wrote in one tweet. “But sooner or later, a pandemic is coming our way, and the world is not ready.” We don't yet know how large a the ""Wuhan"" Coronavirus poses.

In fact, in the days following the tweets, Klain played a role in helping the former vice president’s campaign author an op-ed accusing Trump and his administration of not being prepared to deal with the looming threat. Three days after the op-ed was published, Trump opted to suspend travel between the U.S. and China. Although the travel ban was implemented to stem the risk of the contagion spreading, Biden and his team began alleging any mention of China when describing the virus was xenophobic and potentially even a “racial slur.” “The coronavirus doesn’t have a political affiliation. It will not discriminate on national origin, race, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power, as well as the most vulnerable in society,” the former vice president said recently in response to Trump referring to the pandemic as a “Chinese virus.” “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia-hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering to lead the way instead of science,” Biden added. The tough rhetoric, though, did not seem to apply to Klain. Not only does he continue as an adviser, but Klain has also taken a more public role in leading the campaign’s Coronavirus response.

"U.S. President Donald Trump’s timeline for lifting the novel coronavirus-linked restrictions in the United States by Easter Sunday should be “flexible, Dr. Anthony Fauci declared. The restrictions have shut down a substantial portion of the U.S. economy. Health officials need to assess how widespread the disease is in areas of the U.S. that have not experienced significant numbers of cases, said Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force. Asked about the president’s Easter Sunday goal for reopening the U.S. economy, Fauci told reporters on Tuesday, “You can look at a date, but you’ve got to be very flexible and on a literally day-by-day and week-by-week basis. You need to evaluate the feasibility of what you’re trying to do.” The doctor conceded that lifting restrictions in places like New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., does not make sense. Fauci proclaimed: You may not want to essentially treat it as just one force for the entire country, but look at flexibility in different areas. So I think people might get the misinterpretation you’re just going to lift everything up. … That’s not going to happen. It’s going to be looking at the data. And what we don’t have right now that we really do need, is we need to know what’s going on in those areas of the country where there isn’t an obvious outbreak.” Areas with a low number of cases may be able to ease rules urging people to avoid social gatherings of more than ten people and stay away from bars and restaurants in the coronavirus hotspots, Fauci said He warned, however, that the U.S. does not have enough data to pinpoint where those regions are. Fauci called for aggressive testing and isolation of individuals who are carrying the virus to help prevent the disease from spilling over to parts of the country that have not seen an outbreak. Both Fauci and Trump have pushed back against the mainstream media efforts to create tensions between the two.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the coronavirus relief bill on Wednesday for including broad boosts in unemployment benefits. Sens.

"The immigration lawyers who import H-1B visa workers for U.S. companies are urging President Donald Trump’s deputies to extend the expiring work permits for hundreds of thousands of foreign contract workers during the nation’s unprecedented economic meltdown. The pleas come after the GOP-majority Senate shut down a push by the Democrat-run House to extend the deadline for many types of expiring visas and work permits. The permits are used by employers to replace Americans in U.S. jobs with hundreds of thousands of foreign contract workers, including H-1B graduates. If Trump’s administration agrees to extend the deadlines, it would prevent Americans from filling the visa workers’ jobs during the economic recovery. If the administration does not change the deadline, it would implement Trump’s Inauguration Day promise to enforce a “Hire American” policy and would steer hundreds of thousands of American graduates and blue-collar workers into jobs just before the 2020 election. The “U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has the power to extend those deadlines with a simple website notice, a stroke of the digital pen,” said a March 24 op-ed by Leon Rodriguez, who was the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency under former President Barack Obama. In his Washington Post op-ed, Rodriguez portrayed the huge giveaway to business groups as a modest, life-saving measure that would “save thousands of lives, potentially, and reduce the risk of people falling ill from the novel coronavirus.” He continued: USCIS has the power with just a quickly drafted notice to save people simply by extending for the duration of the pandemic any deadlines that will affect foreign nationals currently in the United States. This would include granting automatic extensions for those whose status will expire during the national emergency, and for a reasonable period thereafter; excusing the late filing of change-of-status requests; and granting “deferred action” status for those whose status will be expiring but who otherwise have no legal avenue for extension. All of these measures have already been requested by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Society for Human Resource Management and other groups. Commendably, USCIS has relaxed certain “wet” signature requirements ordinarily applicable; beyond that, however, it has been silent as to its intentions. The Washington Post’s article did not mention that Rodriguez founded the immigration business at Seyfarth Shaw, a boutique law and advocacy firm in Washington, D.C. Rodriguez’s March 24 plea came as House and Senate leaders negotiated an economic rescue package. The final package, announced March 25, apparently excluded House language that would have extended the visa deadlines. The House language was backed by the business groups who have hired the visa workers in place of Americans. But the visa worker programs are deeply unpopular among at least two vital voting blocs — Trump’s voters and swing-vote college graduates. The second draft of the House Democrats' coronavirus bill keeps a hidden bailout for big biz: Longer visas for their imported workforces.That would cut costs for Fortune 500. IOW, as good as cash in a suitcase.Too bad for unorganized US graduates. #H1Bhttps://t.co/zYRewDpJ8g — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 25, 2020  College-trained reporters at the WashingtonPost rarely mention the huge visa worker economy, which includes roughly 900,000 H-1B workers. The newspaper is owned by Jeff Bezons, whose Amazon companies import many college-trained foreign workers via the H-1B and Occupational Practical Training programs. But the U.S.-India outsourcing economy has lowered American white-collar salaries nationwide and muffled American high-tech innovation by replacing at least 1.5 million American graduates with imported blocs of compliant, legally powerless,Indian and Chinese workers. Rodriguez’s op-ed notes the immigration lawyers’ demand for a deadline extension. “The need to suspend and extend deadlines is urgent,” says a March 23 AILA letter to Ken Cuccinelli, the current director of the USCIS agency. USCIS’ inaction on the suspension and extension of statutory and regulatory deadlines poses a serious and immediate threat to foreign nationals, U.S. employers and the attorneys attempting to adequately represent them … …. unless USCIS adopts the measures outlined in AILA’s March 16 and March 23 letters by this Friday, March 27, 2020, AILA will have no choice but to view USCIS’s inaction as a deliberate attempt to use the current crisis to paralyze the immigration bar and jeopardize the lawful status of hundreds of thousands of law-abiding foreign nationals.. Failure to implement these measures will only further aggravate a dire situation and we will have no choice but to explore alternative measures to compel such action, including, but not limited to, litigation against the agency. The agency has not responded to the letter, an AILA official told Breitbart News March 25. The AILA letter was partly intended to help immigration lawyers who find themselves unable to professionally help their clients because of the nationwide curbs on meetings and travel, the AILA official said. It is also designed to help visa workers and legal immigrants who may miss critical deadlines, he said. “What we’re asking the agency to do has been done in almost every G7 country … if you’re here, [you get] automatic extension of status, somewhere between 90 and 102 days,'” until the routine process can restart, he said. The letter was sent to Cuccinelli at USCIS, not to Chad Wolf, who is the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security agency. However, AILA’s request is unlikely to considered by Wolf. He is a former lobbyist for NASSCOM, which is the trade association created by U.S. and Indian investors to champion the U.S.-India outsourcing economy. NASSCOM has additional lobbyists, according to federal records in Washington, D.C. They have included John Engler, the former GOP governor of Michigan, and Spencer Abraham, a former GOP senator from Michigan. Abraham lost his Senate seat in 2000 after opposing a pro-American immigration reform. Since then, the state’s immigrant population has helped elect Democrats to Abraham’s former seat. American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers, and White Collar Workers of America. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption. In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher. Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.

"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) on Tuesday, called on the Sunni kingdom to “reassure global energy and financial markets” amid the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Pompeo’s comments came amid the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has fueled the global economic downturn. The Chinese coronavirus pandemic has reportedly exacerbated the impact of the oil war on the economy, and vice versa. Pompeo “stressed that as a leader of the G20 and an important energy leader, Saudi Arabia has a real opportunity to rise to the occasion and reassure global energy and financial markets when the world faces serious economic uncertainty,” a State Department readout of the secretary’s conversation with MBS revealed. The secretary and the Sunni kingdom’s crown prince “expressed their deep concern over COVID-19 [coronavirus illness] and the need for all countries to work together to contain the pandemic,” the readout added. Their conversation primarily focused on maintaining stability in energy markets across the world amid the global response. CNBC noted: Oil prices have more than halved since climbing to a peak in January, with analysts warning crude futures could soon plunge into the teens over the coming weeks. It comes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to crush oil demand worldwide and with no end in sight to the ongoing price war between Riyadh and Moscow. The oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia already crashed the U.S. stock market and upended global financial markets. Combined with the impact of the coronavirus, the oil war can have a devastating effect on the U.S. and global economy. Various countries, including the top two economies of the world, the United States and China, almost completely shut down their financial activities in a bid to slow down the spread of the fatal and highly contagious coronavirus. In recent days, China has indicated that it is ready to open its economy back up, despite widespread reports that coronavirus infections continue, unaccounted for, in central Hubei province, where the outbreak originated. U.S. President Donald Trump, on Tuesday, said he wants to open up America’s economy by Easter. Other countries have completely closed down their borders, a move that will have a devastating impact on the global economy.",Pompeo Urges MBS to ‘Reassure Markets’ After Saudi Arabia Launches Oil Price War,2020-03-25,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/25/pompeo-urges-mbs-to-reassure-markets-after-saudi-arabia-launches-oil-price-war/,Breitbart
"The same federal agency that enforces the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) meant to fiercely guard individuals’ medical records is implementing protocol to allow first responders to have access to patient information to protect them for becoming infected with the coronavirus. This would allow law enforcement personnel and paramedics to see records if a person has been infected or exposed to the coronavirus, HHS announced on Tuesday. Law360 reported on the announcement: According to guidance from the department’s Office for Civil Rights, health care providers can also share coronavirus patient information when first responders may be at risk of infection or when the information is necessary to “prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat.” They can also share the information to notify a public health authority to control or stop the spread of disease, the department said. HHS shared the guidelines, which clarify when and how the protected information can be shared without an individual’s authorization under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, to protect first responders in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the department said in a statement Tuesday. Protected information can include a patient’s name and other identifying information, per the guidance. Roger Severino, director of HHS’s Office for Civil Rights, said in a statement that first responders are more vital during this health emergency “like never before.” “[W]e must do all we can to assure their safety while they assure the safety of others,” Severino said. “This guidance helps ensure first responders will have greater access to real-time infection information to help keep them and the public safe.” HHS did includ language that those under HIPAA must make “reasonable efforts” to limit the personal information disclosed and that it should be the “minimum necessary.” “The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects the privacy of patients’ health information (protected health information) but is balanced to ensure that appropriate uses and disclosures of the information still may be made when necessary to treat a patient, to protect the nation’s public health and for other critical purposes,” HHS said last month, according to Law360.

"A report from the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHCHS) in a late 2019 ranked the United States at the best-prepared country to handle a pandemic. This news surfaces as Democrats and never Trumpers are criticizing the Trump administration for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The report, the Global Health Security Index, was “developed with guidance from an international panel of experts from 13 countries, with research by the Economist Intelligence Unit” from 2018 to 2019, the Washington Post reported. “More than 100 researchers spent a year collecting and validating publicly available data,” the Post reported. The report also noted the flaws in U.S. preparedness, including factors like social unrest, terrorism, and low public trust in the federal government. Fox News reported how this analysis clashes with Trump’s critics view of the government’s response to the coronavirus: President Trump’s campaign has argued in recent days that misinformation may be one of the leading causes of that lack of confidence. For example, Trump’s team has pointed to claims by presidential contender Joe Biden that “no one on the National Security Council staff was put in charge” of pandemic preparedness, based on a report that in May 2018, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton eliminated the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in a reorganization effort. Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer reportedly was ousted as senior director, and no replacement was named. But, FactCheck.org has determined that the matter amounted to a reorganization, and that “some team members [of the NSC pandemic office] were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of [the top official’s] duties.” The White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. A senior administration official said earlier this month that the NSC’s global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of coordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump’s coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC. Some of that misinformation comes from former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign, including Biden’s claim that Trump once called the virus a “hoax,” which was debunked by numerous fact-checkers, Fox News reported, “which found that Trump was clearly referring to Democrats’ efforts to blame him for the pandemic, not the virus itself.” Democrats and Biden have also claimed that the Trump administration cut funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but the Associated Press “has noted that those claims ‘distort’ the facts.” “The CDC’s response has been excellent, as it has been in the past,” John Auerbach, president of the nonpartisan Trust for America’s Health, which works with the federal government to improve response to public health threats, said in the Fox News report. “Democrats have charged that Trump decimated the nation’s public health leadership, but Auerbach said CDC’s top scientific ranks have remained stable during the past three years,” Fox News reported.

"Tehran (AFP) — Iran said on Thursday it had “no knowledge” of the whereabouts of a former FBI agent missing since 2007, after his family said he had died in Iranian custody. U.S. President Donald Trump did not confirm Bob Levinson’s death, saying that Iran had not communicated any news on the former agent, who would have turned 72 this month. “Iran has always maintained that its officials have no knowledge of Mr. Levinson’s whereabouts, and that he is not in Iranian custody,” said Alireza Miryousefi, chief press officer at Iran’s mission to the United Nations. “Those facts have not changed.” Levinson’s family said that it had learnt that he was dead, although it gave no information on how or when. “We recently received information from U.S. officials that has led both them and us to conclude that our wonderful husband and father died while in Iranian custody,” said a statement from the family. The family said Levinson died before the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit Iran hard and led authorities to release thousands of prisoners temporarily. Levinson is one of a number of Americans who have disappeared in arch-enemy Iran, but his case has been among the most perplexing, with his family until now insisting he was alive. The father of seven vanished in March 2007 in Kish, an island that has more lenient visa rules than the rest of Iran, and was said to have been investigating cigarette counterfeiting. But the Washington Post reported in 2013 that Levinson, who had retired from the FBI, was working for the CIA and had gone on a rogue mission aimed at gathering intelligence on Iran. Iranian officials have repeatedly said they had no information about him.

"(UPI) — Greece celebrated its independence day Wednesday as Turkish fighter planes violated Greek airspace and hundreds of Syrian refugees spent a 27th day waiting to enter at the border. While the occasion was marked with parades and flag-hoistings, including a prominent military ceremony at the town of Kastanies on the Greece-Turkey border, Greek and Turkish officials exchanged accusations of escalating tensions that have been rising for weeks. Turkish F-16 planes violated Greek airspace at least 10 times on Wednesday, defense officials in Athens said, flying over the eastern Aegean Islands and Greece’s mainland. Syrian refugees, who fled fighting in their homeland and crossed Turkey to reach the Greek border, have been stopped from entering by security forces firing tear gas, water cannons and stun grenades. Although Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan approved the asylum seekers’ transfer to Greece on March 1, none have been permitted to enter. Greece is a EU member and Turkey is not, but Ankara has been providing humanitarian aid to the bloc. The governor’s office of Edirne province listed 977,000 items on Wednesday, distributed to asylum seekers on the border, including diapers, hygiene materials, blankets, clothing and food. Ali Cengiz Kalkan, the provincial health director, accused Greek forces of brutality to keep refugees from entering Greece, saying more than 230 people were recently hospitalized after an attack by Greek forces. “Immigrants cannot find their children after the Greek security forces attack them with gas,” Kalkan said. “Health staff who find those children intervene and provide them with oxygen. It is a very touching scene when these children get to reunite with their parents.” At least three people have been killed by Greek security operations, the Edirne Health Directorate reported. Hundreds of migrants, mostly from Syria, were repelled at the border Wednesday. The number of those awaiting transfer has varied, but Turkey currently houses about 3.7 million refugees.

"The government is trialling coronavirus testing kits which, if they work, will be rolled out to National Health Service (NHS) staff, and may eventually be available for public use. Speaking at Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s daily coronavirus briefing, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said: “Testing in intensive cares and in hospitals is being scaled up. The thing we would like to do next is being able to test NHS and other critical workers who are self-isolating.” Pointing to antibody testing which confirms whether a person has had the virus and is immune, the adviser continued: “Our next priority is to get workers back to work. Once we have more testing, then we want to go out to test people with mild symptoms, we obviously want to go wider. “There are other tests we will want to have, that have not been evaluated, but will be able to tell if someone has had the virus. That will allow us to tell people, ‘You have had the infection, it is likely you will be protected by this.'” The medical adviser clarified, however, that the tests would not get as far as NHS frontline staff unless they passed strict standards, saying: “The one thing worse than no test is a bad test.” On the point of public ability, he said: “I do not think, and I want to be clear, that this is something we’ll be ordering from the Internet in a matter of weeks.” He added: “We need to go through the evaluation, then the first critical uses, and then spread it out from that point of view. We need to do that in a systematic way.” The UK Government Asked for 250,000 Coronavirus Volunteers, and 405,000 Came Forward in 24 Hours https://t.co/Tv8ypO7qdp — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 25, 2020  Whitty made the remarks after the director of Public Health England’s National Infection Service appeared to tell MPs at the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee that chemists and Amazon will be stocking and selling 3.5 million tests within days, and that checking they actually worked was only a “small matter”. Professor Sharon Peacock said in comments reported by The Guardian: “Several million tests have been purchased for use. These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do.” She added: “Once we are assured that they do work, they will be rolled out into the community. Testing the test is a small matter, and I anticipate that it will be done by the end of this week. “In the near future people will be able to order a test that they can test themselves, or go to Boots, or somewhere similar to have their finger prick test done.” Asked whether they would be available in days, rather than weeks or months, she affirmed: “Yes, absolutely.” As of March 24th, 90,436 Britons have been tested, with 82,359 being found negative and  8,077 confirmed positive. 422 patients have died of coronavirus. The government aims to increase the number of tests to 25,000 a day within the next four weeks as the country heads towards the expected peak of the pandemic.

"China endangered the world by spreading “malign misinformation” about the deadly coronavirus outbreak and allowing it to spread outside the Communist state’s borders, the U.S. ambassador to London said Thursday. “First it tried to suppress the news,” Ambassador Woody Johnson wrote in an opinion piece for the Times newspaper, after re-stating that the COVID-19 virus emanated solely from the southern Chinese city of Wuhan. He added the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party (CCP) then selectively shared critical information while keeping international health authorities in the dark about the deadly consequences of coronavirus. “Had China done the right things at the right time, more of its own population, and the rest of the world, might have been spared the most serious impact of this disease,” the ambassador wrote. “When the crisis finally abates we should take stock of the outcome and evaluate the costs of this breakdown in international collaboration,” he said. Johnson’s attack comes just 24-hours after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China wilfully denied the world vital information it needs to stem the pandemic, as Breitbart News reported.

Pompeo also accused Iran and Russia of waging their own distinct disinformation campaigns. “The disinformation campaign from Russia and Iran as well as China continues,” he said. “They’re talking about it coming from the U.S. Army and they’re saying maybe it began in Italy, all things to deflect responsibility.”",U.S. Diplomat: China Endangering the World with Coronavirus,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/26/u-s-diplomat-china-endangering-the-world-with-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Now is the time for world leaders to create one world government to tackle the twin medical and economic crises caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged on Thursday. The left-wing former Labour leader said there was a need for a taskforce involving world leaders, health experts and the heads of international organisations that would have supreme and unfettered executive powers to coordinate the response. He gave no indication of who would appoint the “leaders,” how long they would serve for or just what their powers would involve, the Guardian reports. Brown simply wants a new layer of global supra-government to force a solution to a crisis that began in Wuhan, China. “This is not something that can be dealt with in one country,” he said. “There has to be a coordinated global response.” Brown said the current crisis was different to the one he was involved in 2008 during the global financial crash. “That was an economic problem that had economic causes and had an economic solution. “This is first and foremost a medical emergency and there has to be joint action to deal with that. But the more you intervene to deal with the medical emergency, the more you put economies at risk.” Brown said his proposed global taskforce would fight the crisis on two fronts. There would need to be a coordinated effort to find a vaccine, and to organise production, purchasing and prevent profiteering. “We need some sort of working executive,” Brown said. “If I were doing it again, I would make the G20 a broader organisation because in the current circumstances you need to listen to the countries that are most affected, the countries that are making a difference and countries where there is the potential for a massive number of people to be affected – such as those in Africa.” The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund needed an increase in their financial firepower to cope with the impact of the crisis on low- and middle-income countries, he said.",Former UK PM Gordon Brown: Time for ‘Global Government’ to Tackle Coronavirus,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/former-uk-pm-gordon-brown-time-for-global-government-to-tackle-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Two professors of medicine at Stanford University have proposed that current assumptions about the mortality rate of the Chinese coronavirus are deeply flawed due to miscalculations of the infected population. Writing in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Tuesday, Eran Bendavid, an infectious diseases physician, and Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine, assert that “projections of the death toll could plausibly be orders of magnitude too high” because they are based on gross underestimations of the actual infection rate of the coronavirus. “The true fatality rate is the portion of those infected who die, not the deaths from identified positive cases,” the authors insist. As of March 3, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated a mortality rate for COVID-19 of 3.4 percent, whereas assessment of the mortality rates for the virus in China ranged from 5.8 percent in Wuhan province to 0.7 percent elsewhere. The UK’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, on the other hand, has estimated that it will prove to be 1 percent or lower. In their article, Drs. Bendavid and Bhattacharya suggest that all of these estimations may be significantly higher than the actual mortality rate, once we know how many cases of infection there really are. Using data from the few places where we have a precise idea of how widespread infections are in a given population, we can extrapolate a more accurate mortality rate. In the northeastern Italian town of Vò, for example, the entire population of 3,300 people was tested, revealing a prevalence of 2.7 percent. If this prevalence is applied to the whole province, there would have been 26,000 infections, or more than 130 times the number of reported cases. If this were true, Italy’s real fatality rate could be closer to 0.06 percent than the 8 percent rate based on reported cases, the authors note. Using a similar analysis, the actual number of infections in Wuhan, China, could be in the neighborhood of 180,000 infections, “about 30-fold more than the number of reported cases,” they propose. “The fatality rate, then, would be at least 10-fold lower than estimates based on reported cases.” Two key factors help account for these gross discrepancies, Drs. Bendavid and Bhattacharya suggest. The test used to identify cases does not identify people who were infected and afterward recovered and for a long time, testing was reserved for the severely ill. Epidemiological models still do not reflect these factors. Given the virus’ high contagion rate, Bendavid and Bhattacharya estimate as many as six million Americans have been infected with the disease, which could indicate a mortality rate of 0.01 percent. “This is one-tenth of the flu mortality rate of 0.1%,” they note. The authors hasten to insist that this “does not make Covid-19 a nonissue” and measures must be taken to prevent contagion wherever possible. But it does suggest that the direst predictions of deaths may be wildly overblown. “If we’re right about the limited scale of the epidemic, then measures focused on older populations and hospitals are sensible,” they propose, and “policy makers will need to focus on reducing risks for older adults and people with underlying medical conditions.” In this case, a “universal quarantine may not be worth the costs it imposes on the economy, community and individual mental and physical health,” they conclude.

"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti painted a bleak picture of the fight against coronavirus on Wednesday, saying that people should not have “premature optimism” or “false hope,” and that the city would be shut down for two months. In an interview with Business Insider, the second-term mayor sounded a fatalistic note: In an interview with Insider, Garcetti pushed back against “premature optimism” in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying leaders who suggest we are on the verge of business as usual are putting lives at risk. “I can’t say that strongly enough,” the mayor said. Optimism, he said, has to be grounded in data. And right now the data is [sic] not good. “Giving people false hope will crush their spirits and will kill more people,” Garcetti said, adding it would change their actions by instilling a sense of normality at the most abnormal time in a generation. “This will not kill most of us,” he said. “It will kill a lot more people than we’re used to dying around us.” Read the full interview here. Garcetti is currently facing criticism for moving homeless people out of encampments and into recreation centers in residential areas, against the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which warn against doing so in the middle of “community spread” of coronavirus. He has also threatened to shut water and power off to businesses that fail to comply with orders to stay closed during the pandemic. Joel B.

"French National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen has claimed that the European Union was the first victim of coronavirus, citing a lack of solidarity in combatting the outbreak. Ms Le Pen said that the political bloc even failed when it gave announcements on the virus — a likely reference to statements made by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calling for member-states’ borders to remain open earlier this month. “This is extremely serious because the first thing that we do when we are confronted with a human, plant, or animal epidemic is obviously to immediately control the borders to prevent the spread of the epidemic,” Le Pen said. She went on to add, Le Point reports, that “the EU has said the opposite because it is an ideologist. Free Movement is a religion. Even death does not succeed in convincing its leaders that it is obviously necessary, for a given period, to close the borders to prevent people from regions affected by the virus from coming and spreading it. This is exactly what has happened in Europe.” Marine Le Pen: Brexit is a ‘Terrifying Failure’ For the European Union https://t.co/JhfeY0aT53 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 3, 2020  Commenting on the aftermath of the outbreak, Le Pen said the EU would “learn nothing from it” but that the member-states themselves will take away the need to be more strategic and not put as much faith in globalism during a crisis. “It is the end of the new world that Emmanuel Macron touted, even before he could have started it,” she predicted. The comments come just days after Le Pen’s niece, former MP Marion Maréchal, also criticised the EU, saying: “China came to the aid of Italy before France and meanwhile, government spokesman Sibeth Ndiaye was giving lessons to the Italians.” “Angela Merkel no longer even pretends to play collectively and has not once uttered the word ‘Europe’ in the speech addressed to her fellow citizens,” Ms Maréchal also said. Le Pen has been a noted critic of the European Union for years, once advocating that France should hold a referendum on its membership of the bloc in 2015. A year later she stated that every EU member should hold an EU referendum. While she and the RN have since backed down on holding such a referendum, Le Pen has championed Brexit, and stated earlier this year that the United Kingdom leaving the EU had been a “terrifying failure for the EU”.

"Finland’s former President Martti Ahtisaari has been diagnosed with the Chinese coronavirus just days after his wife had been confirmed to be infected. Finland’s Office of the President of the Republic confirmed that the 82-year-old had tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday afternoon, stating that Ahtisaari was feeling well at the current time. The case comes after the office reported that Eeva Ahtisaari, who is also in her eighties, had been diagnosed with the disease, according to Yle. Both former President Ahtisaari and his wife had previously attended a Helsinki Music Centre Women’s Day celebration concert on March 8th, at which a person with a confirmed case of the disease had also been present. All performers, staff, and audience members may have been exposed to coronavirus and authorities have told those who attended to be mindful of their own health and watch for symptoms. According to an Imperial College London estimate, those over the age of 80 face the highest mortality risk from the virus. Merkel Quarantined After Contact with Doctor Infected by #Coronavirus https://t.co/sdt2m7sBgs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 22, 2020  The infection of the former Finnish head of state comes as several other prominent politicians have either been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus or have self-isolated due to coming into contact with a person with a confirmed case. Nicola Zingaretti of Italy’s Democratic Party (PD) was diagnosed with the disease earlier this month and was the first major politician in Italy, which has become the epicentre of the outbreak, to contract the disease. His case was followed by several other prominent politicians, including French culture minister Franck Riester and Spanish populist politician and leader of VOX Santiago Abascal. Last week, Abascal announced he had overcome the virus and subsequently tested negative for it after a week in isolation. The most senior politician to be affected by the virus has been German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who placed herself into self-isolation over the weekend after coming into contact with a doctor who tested positive for the virus.

"The government is preparing to turn ten more sites into coronavirus field hospitals, akin to that being constructed in the ExCeL centre in London. One Whitehall source has told Sky News that military logisticians are already looking at five sites across the country and, whilst not naming their locations, they are likely to include other large cities like Birmingham, Manchester, and Newcastle. Birmingham is in the West Midlands, the worst-hit contagion area outside of London. A second source told the news broadcaster that the government is looking at between eight and ten sites, while a third said it was around ten to 13. None of the reported proposed facilities would be as large as the one currently being built at the ExCeL convention centre in the Docklands area of London; however, a fourth said that the military was scoping out ten “ExCeL-type” facilities around the country. The east London field hospital, designated NHS Hospital Nightingale, will hold 4,000 beds on two wards and will be staffed by both NHS staff and military medics. It has previously hosted a G20 summit, the 2012 Olympics, and one of the world’s largest armaments fairs. Health secretary Matt Hancock announced on Tuesday that it would be open as early as next week, with an initial capacity for 500 patients.  Its construction, and that of any other future field hospitals, is being done with the support of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. The military’s COVID-19 Support Force has 20,000 personnel on standby from all branches of the military and has already been deployed to deliver masks to medics at St Thomas’ Hospital in London. A video reported by The Guardian and shot by a worker inside of NHS Nightingale shows the scale of the efforts to prepare for the worst of the outbreak, which is expected to hit the United Kingdom in the coming weeks. Alex Woodside posted the video to Facebook and showed the vast scale of one of the wards, reporting also that as well as two wards they are constructing two morgues. Clearly taken aback by the scale of measures, Mr Woodside told viewers: “Just here making the new makeshift hospital. Currently making up cables for it. I didn’t take this virus very seriously until I saw this, this morning. Until I came in and saw the size of the hall.” The worker had a message for those watching: “If you’re not taking it seriously, like I wasn’t, I think we really need to start because they’re preparing for an absolute high death toll here.” “ExCeL, London. Welcome to NHS Nightingale,” he concluded. LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 25: Military personnel walk inside the Excel Centre in East London on March 25, 2020 in London, England. The field hospital will initially contain 500 beds with ventilators and oxygen and will have the capacity to eventually hold up to 4,000 COVID-19 patients.

"President Donald Trump’s return to daily White House press briefings during the coronavirus crisis has generated massive ratings. The New York Times reports nearly 12.2 million people watched Trump’s briefing on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, according to Nielsen — plus millions more on streaming sites, and local news networks. That puts him in the same ratings territory as Monday Night Football, typically the most popular program for a Monday. Millions of Americans have made the president’s daily briefings must-watch television since the coronavirus hit, especially since many of them are in quarantine. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has followed a similar strategy, turning his grim but compassionate daily updates on the fight against the virus into an event for people on the East Coast. President Trump continues to spread optimism about beating the virus from the briefing room podium and returning life to normal, despite cautionary talk from government doctors like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. Vice President Mike Pence offers comfort and reassurance from the podium, reminding Americans to follow the government recommendations to help stop the spread of the virus. The left has turned Fauci into a resistance hero, despite repeated assertions from the doctor that they are on the same team although they serve different roles. Supporters of the president cheer him on as he battles through skeptical journalists who routinely pit themselves against the president. On Wednesday, the president scolded a CBS journalist for suggesting he was only promoting Easter as a date allowing Americans go back to church so he could win re-election. He replied: I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls. And I don’t know if that’s so, but I do think it’s so that a lot of — that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen. He added: I think it’s very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news. You do. She does. There are people in your profession that write fake news. They would love to see me, for whatever reason — because we’ve done one hell of a job. Nobody has done the job that we’ve done. And it’s lucky that you have this group here, right now, for this problem, or you wouldn’t even have a country left. “Social distancing” restrictions have reduced the number of White House reporters allowed in the room, giving establishment reporters unprecedented access to the president, shutting out lesser-known and conservative outlets. Cable news networks, who repeatedly criticized Trump’s decision to end the daily briefings, now find themselves torn whether to air the president’s daily exchange with the press live. On Wednesday, CNN cut away from the president’s briefing only to swiftly return when Dr. Anthony Fauci began speaking. The president has demonstrated interest in keeping the briefings going. When journalists asked him last week if he would commit to continuing the daily briefing he replied, “Well, I’ve gotten to like this room.” “This has been a very convenient room for all of us,” he continued. “You people are set up. So I never even thought of closing it. So you’re asking me a question that I never thought in terms of closing it.” He acknowledged that he was not always a fan of the establishment media’s questions, but that it was good to “get it out of your system.” “[W]e take a lot of questions from you,” he continued. “Unfortunately, some of them are repetitive and some of them are fantastic questions. Some of these questions are great. Some of the questions lead to us solving a problem.  You bring up problems that people didn’t know existed.  But I just want to let you know, so we’re doing this so that we can be transparent, so that we can get everything out.”",Huge Ratings: Millions of Americans Watching Donald Trump’s Daily White House Briefings,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/huge-ratings-millions-of-americans-watching-donald-trumps-daily-white-house-briefings/,Breitbart
"Now is the time for global leaders to create one world government to tackle the twin medical and economic crises caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged on Thursday. The left-wing former Labour leader said there was a need for a taskforce involving world leaders, health experts and the heads of international organisations that would have supreme and unfettered executive powers to coordinate the response. He gave no indication of who would appoint the “leaders,” how long they would serve for or just what their powers would involve, the Guardian reports. Brown simply wants a new layer of global supra-government to force a solution to a crisis that began in Wuhan, China. “This is not something that can be dealt with in one country,” he said. “There has to be a coordinated global response.” Brown said the current crisis was different to the one he was involved in 2008 during the global financial crash. “That was an economic problem that had economic causes and had an economic solution. “This is first and foremost a medical emergency and there has to be joint action to deal with that. But the more you intervene to deal with the medical emergency, the more you put economies at risk.” Brown said his proposed global taskforce would fight the crisis on two fronts. There would need to be a coordinated effort to find a vaccine, and to organise production, purchasing and prevent profiteering. “We need some sort of working executive,” Brown said. “If I were doing it again, I would make the G20 a broader organisation because in the current circumstances you need to listen to the countries that are most affected, the countries that are making a difference and countries where there is the potential for a massive number of people to be affected – such as those in Africa.” The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund needed an increase in their financial firepower to cope with the impact of the crisis on low- and middle-income countries, he said.",Former UK PM Gordon Brown: Time for ‘Global Government’ to Tackle Coronavirus,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/former-uk-pm-gordon-brown-time-for-global-government-to-tackle-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"President Trump’s job approval numbers are surging to the best figures of his 3.5 year-old  presidency. According to the RealClearPoltiics poll of polls, Trump’s approval rating sits at a very healthy 47 percent, beating his previous record of 46 percent by a full point. What’s more, Trump’s disapproval rating dipped to 49.5 percent, his best showing since February of 2017, the month after he assumed the presidency. In fact, this is the first time his disapproval rating has been below 50 percent since February of 2017. Here’s some context… Ten days ago, Trump’s average approval rating was three points lower at 44 percent, while his disapproval rating was 3.5 points higher at 53 percent. In just a little over a week, Trump’s numbers have improved by a net 6.5 points. This, of course, is due to the president’s handling of the medical and financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On that specific front, the most recent polling shows that either a plurality or an outright majority approve of the job he’s doing handling this crisis. A recent Gallup poll showed a 60 percent approval rating. There are six obvious reasons for this… Bottom line: The president is doing a good job and the people see it.

"Joe Biden told a small group of young people at a “Happy Hour” YouTube event on Wednesday that he believes Obamacare is “maybe the most important human right that anyone should have.” “One of the proudest days of my career in the United States vice presidency was the day we passed Obamacare,” Biden said. “You know, there’s over 100 million people with preexisting conditions,” he said, claiming, “They weren’t able to get insurance before; now they cannot be denied insurance.” “Also, there’s 20 million people who never had health insurance before that have it now,” Biden said. “You’re able to stay on your parents’ policies now until you’re 26 years old, which is vitally important to a generation,” he added. “And so to me, it is, maybe, the most important human right that anyone should have and that is to be able to take care of your own,” Biden said. The candidate said his healthcare plan is to “restore the cuts” to Obamacare and “further subsidize it.” He said he will “significantly drive down drug prices, significantly drive down costs,” though he did not provide specifics.

"When all this is over we’re going to look back and see who has had a good war and who has had a bad war; who called it right, who covered themselves in glory, who showed themselves to be an hysterical bedwetter, who placed too much trust in the wrong “experts”, and so on. Piers Morgan, I think we can all agree, has not had a good war. Definitely on the list of those who have had a good war is the excellent Sherelle Jacobs. Her Telegraph piece today — ‘This virus is the West’s Berlin Wall moment’ — is bang on the nail. She writes: “To put lockdown in the most cynical terms, the Government has decided to crash the economy rather than expose itself to political criticism.” Yes. One of the lessons we’re going to learn in the aftermath of this crisis is that too many governments — including Britain’s — set far too much store by the dubious prognostications and dodgy models of their house scientific “experts”; and paid far too little attention to the economic and socio-political implications of what these overcautious, skin-saving, hidebound, model-dependent “experts” were advising us to do on the basis of their shaky scientific hypotheses. We have all become victims of a giant junk-science experiment which threatens to cause far, far more harm than anything the coronavirus might ever have managed. The sooner we realise this and start rowing back, the sooner we can go about retrieving what’s left of the global economy. At least Donald Trump gets this. This, I believe, is the single most important thing any world statesman has said — or ever will say — about the coronavirus pandemic: WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020  And thank heavens he does get it. As America leads so the rest of the world follows. If Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama — or indeed Joe Biden — were U.S. president right now it would be a very different story. This tweet from Biden tells you all you need to know: Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 25, 2020  OK, so on one level it’s just a shameless, cynical attempt to position himself as the anti-Trump, so that he can hoover up any spare votes in the event of Trump’s response being found wanting, or in the event of lots of people dying. But on another, it characterises everything that is wrong with the left’s thinking generally — but also with the thinking of all those people in the middle or on the right who have recently been championing leftist thinking in the belief that desperate times call for extraordinary measures. I’d like to focus particularly on that weasel phrase “one more point to the Dow.” Biden is inviting us to believe that the Dow — i.e. the performance of the markets — is dispensable; he is playing on the notion, so prevalent among the deluded left, that the financial sector is purely the preserve of overprivileged one percenters with top hats and cigars. This couldn’t be more wrong. When the Dow sneezes we all catch a cold — one which, in dark times like these, will have far greater impact and cause more damage than Covid-19. The markets, after all, are merely an expression of the health of the global economy. And the health of the global economy means EVERYTHING. I got quite cross about this on my recent podcast with Sven Hughes, who put it to me that there was something heartless, uncaring and not helpful to conservatism when I argued that we are overvaluing the lives of the mostly elderly or health-compromised people dying as a result of coronavirus and undervaluing the broader economy.

"TEL AVIV – Israel’s health system is woefully unprepared to deal with the effects of an epidemic, a report written before the coronavirus outbreak and released Monday by the state comptroller said. Based on a scenario involving an influenza outbreak, the report found the government failed to formulate sufficient plans to combat such an outbreak and had a severe lack of both medicine and medical equipment, including ventilators. Some 25 percent –  about 2,250,000 Israelis – would be impacted by the epidemic and death rates would be on the rise over a period of eight weeks. Around 150,000 Israelis would be hospitalized, with about 25,000 in ICUs. The report noted general overcrowding in all Israeli hospitals and a lack of ICU beds. The National Preparedness Program noted anti-viral medication should be stockpiled to accommodate 25 percent of the population, nine percent more than is currently available. Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was health minister during part of the period covered in the report, said that while “there is room for improvement,” the report is not relevant to coronavirus. “There is no country in the world that could forecast or prepare for the spread of the virus,” he said in a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. “No health system in the world, even the best one, was prepared to deal with the epidemic.” “Thanks to the steps taken by the Prime Minister, which preempted the world, Israel’s situation is better than many developed countries. Even before the Coronavirus spread to Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu held comprehensive discussions in which – inter alia – the directive was given to establish a system of vaccines that would assist in dealing with epidemics,” the statement said. It went on to note Netanyahu had ordered thousands of ventilators and 1,000 hospital beds to be ICU-ready. The health system will have hundreds of job openings, including 200 positions for doctors, 605 for nurses, around 300 janitorial positions, and around 6,000 students to render assistance as well hundreds of positions for interns, the statement said. The health ministry responded that the state comptroller’s report was being studied. “Israel was one of the first countries to understand the severity of the pandemic and led by the NSC and the Health Ministry, drastic measures were taken to close the borders of the country that were subsequently implemented in almost all countries of the world,” a statement from the ministry said. “The purpose of the health ministry’s policy in dealing with the coronavirus is to try to flatten the curve of the sick so there be less morbidity and a dramatic increase in the number of the ill and hospitalized patients. The medical staff in hospitals and the community are at the forefront of coronavirus care, a front that is likely to continue for at least a few more months,” the statement said. According to a report by Israel’s Channel 13, the health ministry is pushing Netanyahu to impose a complete lockdown on the country for seven days.",Ombudsman: Israel’s Health System Majorly Unprepared for Epidemic,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/26/ombudsman-israels-health-system-majorly-unprepared-for-outbreak/,Breitbart
"In a Thursday rant on his MSNBC show “Morning Joe,” Joe Scarborough sounded off on the rising number of deaths in the United States as a result of the coronavirus. After repeating his belief more Americans would die from coronavirus than have died in every war combined, Scarborough said more Americans would die from coronavirus than died in 9/11. He added Republicans are “ready to euthanize” senior citizens because they do not want to see Boeing’s corporate earnings dip too low. “It seems that Republicans now are making the argument let the World War II vets die, let the Korean War vets die, let the Vietnam vets die, let everybody in that generation die because we’re worried about Boeing,” Scarborough declared. “They want Boeing, who gets, by the way, a $17 billion bailout by this package after killing people because of their selfishness, because of their greediness. I mean, all these other companies with stock buybacks, the same thing happened there. We have Republicans — we have people like Lindsey Graham and Rick Scott more concerned about Boeing than unemployed people in their own state.” He added, “As you know, I’m not a Democrat. There are a lot of things that Democrats do that drive me crazy. I watched the first Democratic debate, and I just looked at wonderment at how far left Twitter had pulled the party, but there is no doubt if you’re talking about the party of life right now, as the American conservative wrote, right now these conservatives are making Democrats who are pro-choice actually look more pro-life because they’re only worried about the unborn. It is the born, it is the weakest among us, it is senior citizens who they’re ready to euthanize because they want Boeing’s corporate earnings to not dip too low.

"The Club for Growth Foundation will on Thursday release its 2019 congressional scorecard, which details how lawmakers voted on economic legislation, Breitbart News learned exclusively. The Club for Growth Foundation revealed in its scorecard that 40 House lawmakers and six U.S. senators will receive the conservative organization’s Defender of Economic Freedom Award for 2019. In 2018, 20 House representatives and five senators received the award. Starting in 2011, the Club for Growth Foundation required that lawmakers not only score 90 percent or better on votes cast annually but also maintain a lifetime rating of at least 90 percent to receive the award. “The Club for Growth Foundation’s annual Congressional Scorecard is the leading tool for activists, investors, and the media to measure how Members of Congress vote on economic policy,” said David Mcintosh, the president of Club for Growth. “Every year, we have disappointments and surprises, and this year is no different. While it’s good to see more Members earn the title of Defenders of Economic Freedom, there are always a few who stray from supporting economic liberty.” Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mike Braun (R-IN) received a perfect score in 2019, and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Pat Toomey (R-PA) also received the award.

"New York City will close several streets in an effort to combat the spread of the Chinese coronavirus as the number of cases in the city continue to lead the country. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Wednesday that vehicular traffic will be banned from the following streets between Friday, March 27 to Monday, March 30: Manhattan’s Park Ave, between 28th and 34th, Brooklyn’s Bushwick Ave, Johnson to Flushing, Queens’ 34th Ave, 73rd St to 80th St, and the Bronx’s Grand Concourse, between E. Burnside and 184th. The governor said NYPD officers will patrol the areas to ensure pedestrians are following social distancing measures. The city could shut down additional streets in the coming days. Gov. Cuomo also said that the state could close parks and playgrounds. “The plan is going to pilot closing streets in New York City because we have much less traffic in New York City. We have many fewer vehicles in New York City,” the governor told reporters said at a press briefing in Albany. “People want to walk. They want to go out and get some air. You want a less dense area, so pilot closing streets to cars, opening streets to pedestrians.” On Tuesday, the White House coronavirus task force called on individuals leaving New York City to self-quarantine for 14 days. President Donald Trump said the city has become the country’s “hot spot” for the deadly illness. “We remain deeply concerned about New York City and the New York metro area,” Dr. Deborah Birx, the task force’s response coordinator, said. Birx noted that roughly 56% of all U.S. cases and 31% of all death are in the city. 30,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in New York and 17,856 in New York City. 285 have died from the virus.",New York City Closing Several Streets to Fight Coronavirus Spread,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/new-york-city-closing-several-streets-to-fight-coronavirus-spread/,Breitbart
"The Pentagon announced Wednesday its first case of coronavirus found in the building, involving a U.S. Marine. “A U.S. Marine stationed at the Pentagon tested positive for COVID-19 on March 24,” the Pentagon announced in a statement Wednesday evening. “The Marine is in isolation at his home and will undergo further assessment by health professionals. His last day in the Pentagon was March 13,” it said. The Pentagon statement said the Marine followed U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and Department of Defense directives by isolating himself when an immediate family member began to show symptoms. It said once the Marine became ill, he contacted his assigned medical facility. “His workspace has been cleaned by a Pentagon response team and a thorough contact investigation is underway to mitigate risk and preserve the health of the workforce at the Pentagon,” it said. The Pentagon is one of the largest office buildings in the world and houses thousands of offices that keep the enormous defense enterprise running. The building has its own post office, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office, a CVS Pharmacy, several retail stores, and multiple food courts. Defense Secretary Mark Esper raised the building’s health protection condition (HPCON) to “high” on Wednesday morning, which initiated enhanced screening measures.

"(AFP) — The lockdown in the Chinese outbreak city of Wuhan brought the Covid-19 epidemic crashing to a halt, giving health systems crucial breathing room to deal with serious cases, new research showed Thursday. Chinese authorities ordered schools, universities and businesses shut following a cluster of Covid-19 cases in the transport hub in January, confining millions of people to their homes in a bid to contain the outbreak. The measures sent the numbers of new cases tumbling, and parts of Hubei province, where Wuhan is situated, have slowly started returning to normal. With roughly three billion people currently advised to stay at home amid the pandemic, a study published in The Lancet Public Health examined what the rest of the world can learn from Wuhan. Researchers developed a model to estimate the impact that school and business closures had on COVID-19 transmission rates, using data on how often people interact and where. The Wuhan outbreak came at the worst possible time — on the eve of Lunar New Year, when tens of millions of Chinese travel to celebrate with their families. The study compared three separate scenarios: no intervention and no holiday travel; no physical distancing and normal holiday travel; and school closures with only key workers at work. They found that intervention in form of school and business closures had a significant impact in reducing new cases, buying vital time for health systems to process the spike in cases. The team also predicted the impact of lifting control measures. Their models suggested that waiting until April to lift social distancing would reduce total infections by a quarter. It would also delay a second peak of the virus from August to October, again buying health workers vital time. “The unprecedented measures the city of Wuhan has put in place to reduce social contacts in school and the workplace have helped to control the outbreak,” said lead author Kiesha Prem from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “However, the city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases. But if they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.” Commenting on the research, James Gill, honourary clinical lecturer at Warwick Medical School, said it had “profound” implications for countries seeking to learn lessons from the Chinese Covid-19 response. He said the study showed the “sought-after ‘flattening of the curve’, along with the reduction of total cumulative infections, whilst also demonstrating a delay in the peak of the outbreak by two months.” Coronavirus: Thugs Mugging Nurses for Their IDs to Get Free Food and Drink https://t.co/N5zjiaKTDB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 26, 2020  ‘Avoid new waves’  A study from Britain’s Imperial College this month showed that Covid-19 case numbers could be brought under control via extreme social distancing measures but were liable to rebound once such restrictions were relaxed. Yang Liu from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Lancet study co-author said that the Wuhan example was unlikely to be replicated exactly elsewhere. “But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection when workers and school children return to their normal routine,” she said. “If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems”. Tim Colbourn from University College London said the research was “crucial for policymakers everywhere. “Given many countries with mounting epidemics now potentially face the first phase of lockdown, safe ways out of the situation must be identified,” said Colborn, who was not involved in the study.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden released an economic plan Thursday morning in the aftermath of Senate passage of a $2 trillion emergency relief bill to help the economy in the coronavirus pandemic. In a video accompanying the plan, Biden said that the key to the stimulus would be “execution.” The first step in Biden’s plan is to use the Defense Production Act to expand testing capacity and build new ventilators and other needed supplies. President Donald Trump has already invoked that act, but has not enforced it, saying that the private sector is stepping up to produce what the country needs without “nationalization.” Biden’s second step is to “launch a task force” that would report to “directly” to him “to make sure every dollar going out the door gets to the people who need it — fast.” As Biden’s press statement noted, Biden chaired a similar effort when President Barack Obama signed the $862 billion stimulus into law in 2009. However, that effort was largely viewed as a failure. Three-quarters of the jobs protected or created by the stimulus were in government. Billions of dollars went to pet projects and special interests. Biden took a particular interest in solar panel manufacturer Solyndra — which failed. The Recovery.gov website was often unusable, with projects marked for congressional districts that did not exist. And unemployment soared into double-digits, after the administration suggested it would not exceed eight percent. Biden’s third step is to “build the next deal” in Congress to add even more stimulus, such as “additional checks” to families. In a new video outlining the plan, Biden says the next congressional bill should include: – Student debt forgiveness– Increase social security payments– Full paid sick leave– More cash relief if necessaryhttps://t.co/MWCFil6HuL — Johnny Verhovek (@JTHVerhovek) March 26, 2020  The next round could also include the “Green New Deal,” as he suggested in a virtual press conference on Wednesday.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) could remain in the presidential race until June as the coronavirus pandemic continues to overshadow the Democrat presidential primary. Despite suffering a load of key losses in the March primaries and nixing campaign ads following the disappointing showings, Sanders is not committing to dropping out of the race — at least, not yet. While it is true that his campaign indicated this month that it was reassessing — an admission almost always followed by imminent departure — Sanders has yet to formally close the door on his presidential aspirations. Rather than keenly addressing his presidential future, Sanders has devoted the bulk of his time and energy to the coronavirus response, holding virtual roundtable discussions featuring special guests multiple times a week. It has become clear Sanders is angling to use the negative situation to his political advantage, demonstrating his ability to handle a national crisis — a characteristic many look for in a presidential candidate. Notably, he has used his roundtable discussions and addresses on the coronavirus to push one of his hallmark proposals, Medicare for All, on several occasions. “Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,” Sanders said in an address this month: While we work to pass a Medicare for All single-payer system, the United States government today must make it clear that in the midst of this emergency, everyone in our country — regardless of income or where they live — must be able to get all of the health care they need without cost. “This is really about life and death,” Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner said. “The senator is the only candidate in this race that has that capacity that he’s not just a candidate running for president, but he is a sitting United States senator who has an ability to weigh in on policy,” she added. Meanwhile, the presidential hopeful has demonstrated irritability to questions regarding the future of his presidential campaign, bluntly telling CNN congressional correspondent Manu Raju last week, “I’m dealing with a fucking global crisis.” Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir shared that general sentiment, stating that the Vermont senator is “focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.” Even so, Sanders’ campaign signaled, again, that the presidential hopeful has no immediate intention of dropping out of the race. That became abundantly evident after the campaign confirmed that he would participate in an April debate if the Democratic National Committee (DNC) proceeded in scheduling one. “Senator Sanders is still running for president,” Sanders campaign official Mike Casca said, according to the New York Times. “If there is a debate in April, he plans to be there.” While Sanders devotes his energy to the economic and health crisis, his campaign is gearing up for primaries that could be postponed to June, including Ohio, Delaware, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Sanders campaign announced this month its intention to beef up its presence in Pennsylvania, although it made the announcement prior to the state’s decision to move its April 28 primary. According to Politico,  “his campaign is also touting that it is ramping up staff in New York, which a senior aide said is ‘a sign that he is still in.'” “Bernie has every reason to stay in,” DNC member James Zogby said, according to Politico. “He has a role to play in policies of course, but also continuing to be the glue that holds the progressive movement together.” Biden, who holds what many consider an unconquerable delegate lead, holds a different view. “I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this,” Biden told reporters via Zoom on Wednesday. While organizers are going over contingency plans due to the coronavirus, the DNC said the July convention is still slated to proceed as planned in July, but only time will tell if Sanders will soldier on until the very end.",Bernie Sanders Could Remain in the Presidential Race Until June,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/bernie-sanders-could-remain-in-the-presidential-race-until-june/,Breitbart

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly struck a deal with opposition Blue and White leader Benny Gantz to form an emergency national unity government that will keep Netanyahu in charge for 18 months. The news caused shockwaves in Israeli politics on Thursday, and immediately caused the Blue and White party to collapse, as fellow leader Yair Lapid withdrew. The party’s sole unifying principle had been to oppose Netanyahu. Netanyahu’s party, the Likud, won the elections earlier this month — Israel’s third successive attempt — with 36 seats. It was Netanyahu’s best result, but his coalition of right-wing parties fell short of a 61-seat majority. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin gave Gantz the first opportunity to form a government. But because his left-wing coalition could not form a majority without 15 seats won by Arab parties, some of whom oppose the existence of the State of Israel, he found it politically impossible to find a governing formula. Netanyahu appealed to Gantz to form an emergency unity government to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Gantz appears to have accepted. Under the reported terms of the proposed deal, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for another 18 months, and Gantz — who would begin as foreign minister — would take over in 2021. Both Netanyahu and Gantz visited the White House earlier this year for the rollout of President Donald Trump’s peace plan for the region. Netanyahu faces trial in May on corruption charges that supporters say are baseless and politically motivated. The Blue and White coalition had run on the idea that the country could not have an indicted prime minister. But Netanyahu has earned praise for his early, if harsh, response to the coronavirus pandemic now ravaging the world. Joel B.

"TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Wednesday if there was no improvement in the amount of confirmed coronavirus cases then he would have no choice but to begin a total lockdown.  His announcement came just hours after a new wave of restrictions came into effect, which included limiting walks to 100 meters from people’s homes. He said: The steps that we have taken here in Israel are being taken all over the world; however, they are not enough because the number of patients is doubling itself every three days. In two weeks we are liable to find ourselves with thousands of patients many of whom will be in danger of death. Therefore, I am already telling you that if we do not see an immediate improvement in the trend, there will be no alternative but to impose a complete lockdown, except for essential needs such as food and medicines. This is a matter of a few days. We are making all of the requisite preparations – logistical and legal. “So, I am already telling you now you,” he continued, “unless we see an immediate improvement in the trend, there will be no escape from implementing a complete lockdown, except for essential necessities such as food and medicine. “Stay in your homes and stay alive. Because the danger lies with everyone. It does not differentiate.” So far 2,369 have been confirmed to have contracted the virus. Five Israelis have died. As of 5pm Wednesday, only essential businesses, including supermarkets and pharmacies, were permitted to remain open. Netanyahu warned officials on Monday during a seven-hour emergency phone meeting that as many as a million Israelis could become infected with the virus. “We could reach a million infected within a month,” Netanyahu told ministers according to a report on Israel’s Channel 12. “There could also be 10,000 dead Israelis.” He also said he would increase restrictions in an effort to flatten the virus’ curve. Health Ministry Director-General Moshe Bar-Siman-Tov warned during the meeting Israel could find itself in the same “nightmare scenario” Italy is in unless extreme measures are put in place. Within a week, the number of patients diagnosed with the virus who would need ventilators are likely to reach in the hundreds and possibly thousands, he said. He added all unessential services must be shut down immediately and military rations should be handed out to Israelis. It “may sound extreme, I think we even need to close some of the grocery stores and maybe hand out prepared meals to some parts of the public,” he said in an interview with Ynet news site.

"As President Donald Trump’s approval ratings hit all-time highs, Trump’s critics are now arguing that the nightly news broadcasts are inadvertently upping his ratings by inadvertently making Trump seem “coherent,” “competent,” and “presidential” by truncating his rambling responses during the Coronavirus crisis. Press Watch’s Dan Froomkin argued on Wednesday “that the broadcast networks shouldn’t break into regular programming to show the briefings live anymore. Watching them, unfiltered, makes their viewers dumber and less safe.” Do you have a child? Even if you don’t, you are certainly familiar with the concept of positive and negative consequences. Right now, when Trump lies, the only consequences are positive – his base gets just that much more fired up. https://t.co/EU2wFDtMRf — Dan Froomkin/PressWatchers.org (@froomkin) March 26, 2020  “More often than not, mainstream reporting on even the most incoherent and contradictory Trump briefing consists of cherry-picking quotes that make him sound coherent, and in no way whatsoever indicate the true nature of the lunacy,” Froomkin continued. “To some degree, we’re getting the worse of both worlds right now. When Trump says something outrageous, the media unthinkingly broadcasts it live – then ignores it.” New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie said that the evening news broadcasts could also be making Trump seem more competent because they have a limited amount of time to air Trump’s words. Bouie flagged a tweet about evening news broadcasts last week seeing a 42 percent increase in viewership (32 million viewers) from last year and said “this may help explain” the president’s approval ratings because “evening news broadcasts are featuring a truncated Trump who appears more competent than he is as a result of editing.” this may help explain trump’s approval ratings. evening news broadcasts are featuring a truncated Trump who appears more competent than he is as a result of editing. https://t.co/msNSjDKik2 — b-boy bouiebaisse (@jbouie) March 25, 2020  As Froomkin pointed out, the “nation’s most eminent media critics are virtually unanimous that television networks should stop the live broadcasting of the White House’s daily coronavirus briefings” because “Trump has turned into a torrent of dangerous lies, misinformation and self-aggrandizement.” But cable news producers and hosts are struggling to figure out how to prevent Trump from “hijacking” the briefings and turning them into “virtual campaign rallies.” MSNBC’s Chris Hayes simply did not play any sound on Tuesday while airing Trump’s clips and corrected Trump’s “lies.” According to the Daily Beast, “privately, several staffers at CNN and MSNBC have acknowledged that airing Trump’s pressers live and in full likely amplifies the spread of misinform.” An NBC News “insider” even reportedly told the outlet that Trump needs to be “quarantined” like the Coronavirus: “I think the best way to handle the president in the briefing is that you handle the president like you handle the virus.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) offered tough talk on China, including its role in spreading a virus that has killed thousands around the world and holding the United States hostage by controlling the global drug supply, in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow opened the interview with a portion of Blackburn’s hard-hitting speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, where she called for stopping Chinese thuggery: This may seem like something that is too large or too risky an undertaking, but we have already paid dearly for our reliance on Chinese drug manufacturers, and it’s not going to stop because that vulnerability is leverage in the hands of madmen in Beijing who seek nothing but power and will go to any lengths to acquire that power. They don’t care who they hurt. It’s clear with this global pandemic. They don’t care if it is innocent people that are sick or maybe even that lose their life. And they defy us, they defy us when we try to stop them. It’s time that we rise to the challenge and that we return this supply chain. Blackburn told Breitbart News Daily that China’s control of the global drug supply and it using it against its enemies, including the United States, has been put in the spotlight after the coronavirus took root in Central China before spreading around the world.    “China caused this,” Blackburn said. “They withheld the information. They erroneously blamed it on the United States Army.” “We should hold them to account for what they have caused — that created a global pandemic and destabilized the health and the financial systems and the food supply of people all over the globe,” Blackburn said. The United States should also, Blackburn said, put a halt to its dependence on China by bringing the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals back to this country. “The best way for us to do that is to make America manufacture again,” Blackburn said, referring to the Securing America’s Medicine Cabinet Act, which she and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) are proposing. Blackburn has dubbed the bill MAMA — Make America Manufacture Again. The bill also calls for building up the nation’s pharmaceutical stockpile and developing an emerging threats and technology division at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It also would establish Centers of Excellence at universities to partner with U.S. pharmaceutical companies to strengthen the nation’s drug infrastructure. The interview also included a discussion about China’s efforts to dominate global technology and the need for the U.S. to thwart that effort. Both Marlow and Blackburn said they see a silver lining in this current crisis, with Marlow saying it has “awakened a sleeping giant” and Blackburn saying we must move forward based on lessons learned. “Let’s never let China have control of the global economy again,” Blackburn said.

"Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Thursday revealed that Americans should expect to have their coronavirus stimulus checks direct deposited or in the mail “within three weeks.” Mnuchin praised the Senate for its “swift action” to get the American public the relief funds, saying he and President Donald Trump “couldn’t be more pleased” with the bipartisan support the bill received.

"The U.S. Education Department announced Thursday its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is holding Penn State accountable for failing to protect students from sexual abuse as was discovered during the scandal involving assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. “As I’ve said before, ‘justice delayed is justice denied,’ and for too long the students of Penn State have been denied justice,” said Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in a statement. The secretary added: I committed to clearing out the backlog of cases we inherited from the previous administration, and we are doing just that. I hope resolution of this Title IX investigation and the changes we are requiring will help to bring continued healing to the Penn State community. In a letter of finding sent to Eric J. Barron, Ph.D., Penn State president, OCR wrote: This compliance review was launched in light of the revelations of former University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky’s sexual abuse of minors at the University, and the wholly inadequate response thereto by former highranking University officials. As a result, it is critical that the University have policies and practices in place to prevent the recurrence of such abuse. Accordingly, the compliance review examined the University’s handling of complaints of sexual misconduct, with particular emphasis on complaints of sexual assault, to determine if the University has responded appropriately. DeVos and the OCR are requiring major changes at Penn State in the wake of the Obama administration’s failure to resolve the investigation that launched in early 2014. According to a press statement from the department: With the conclusion of this investigation, OCR is holding Penn State accountable for its failures to have systems in place that protect students, including when sexual misconduct involves athletic staff.  The University must now provide for individual remedies for survivors whose complaints OCR determined that Penn State failed to handle promptly and equitably, revise its recordkeeping practices to ensure proper documentation of sexual harassment complaints, and report to OCR on the handling of all Title IX complaints for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic years. After a review that included policies and procedures on eight campuses of Penn State, OCR discovered the school was still violating Title IX, the federal civil rights law that was passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972, across several years, including: During the 2016-2017 academic year for student complaints and the 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 academic years for complaints first reported to the Athletic Department, Penn State failed to appropriately respond to complaints of sexual harassment. During the 2016-17 academic year, the University failed to maintain records necessary for OCR to determine whether the University complied with Title IX. During the 2017-2018 through the 2019-2020 academic years, the University continued to fail to implement adequate record-keeping practices. During the 2019-20 academic year, the University’s Title IX policies and procedures failed to provide adequate notice to students and employees of the procedures; to ensure fair and appropriate investigation of complaints; to provide procedures for complaints alleging discrimination based on sex carried out by employees and third parties; to provide designated and reasonably prompt timeframes for the major stages of the complaint process; and to provide notice to parties of the outcome of investigations of complaints. In addition to these violations, OCR also found that the school had recently failed to allow for due process by imposing “interim suspensions prior to providing the accused an opportunity to respond to allegations.” According to the department, OCR and Penn State have entered into a “Resolution Agreement” that requires the school to provide for individual solutions for its failure to file the complaints of students promptly and report to OCR on its procedures in the current and coming academic years. Penn State must also revise its current Title IX policies and documentation practices to ensure they respond to sexual harassment complaints appropriately and with accurate record-keeping. In addition, the school must ensure all university and athletic staff receive Title IX training. Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus said in a statement: Given all of the attention that Penn State has faced in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, it is disappointing that so many serious problems have remained at that university system. As OCR has demonstrated, schools will be held responsible for how they respond to complaints of sexual harassment. We are pleased that Penn State has now agreed, in a spirit of cooperation, to fix the problems that we have identified. OCR will closely monitor the University to make sure that it fulfills the requirements of the Resolution Agreement. In November, Sandusky was effectively given a life term in prison when a judge resentenced him during a hearing ordered by an appeals court to the same 30-to-60-year term that was imposed in 2012 for sexual abuse of children. In the wake of Sandusky’s 2011 arrest, Penn State Hall of Fame head coach Joe Paterno was fired and the university paid out more than $100 million to individuals who claimed Sandusky had abused them. As the Associated Press reported, Sandusky, 75, was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012, but continued to assert his innocence.",Education Department Holds Penn State Accountable for Sexual Misconduct in Jerry Sandusky Scandal,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/03/26/education-department-holds-penn-state-accountable-for-sexual-misconduct-in-jerry-sandusky-scandal/,Breitbart
"The U.S. Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort will arrive alongside New York City as early as next week, Navy officials said Thursday. “We’ve accelerated the plan for Comfort. We had originally been looking at April 3, but in all likelihood, she’s going to be getting underway this weekend, so hopefully she’ll be there in New York by the early part of next week,” Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly confirmed. The Comfort will bring 1,000 additional hospital beds to New York, which is the hardest hit state so far by the coronavirus epidemic within the U.S. with more than 32,000 cases reported. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said his state has only about 53,000 beds but predicted he could need as many as 110,000 beds. He has previously said that the peak of the virus was expected mid-April, but said it could now come earlier. The Comfort is not expected to treat coronavirus patients, but help alleviate the strain on civilian hospitals in New York, as they deal with an influx of patients with coronavirus. The Comfort will have more than 1,100 active-duty Navy medical crew, and about 60 Navy reserve medical staff. It is deploying from its homeport in Norfolk, Virginia. The Navy’s other hospital ship, the USNS Mercy, which is home-ported in San Diego, is expected to arrive in Los Angeles this week to help alleviate a potential strain on civilian hospital systems there.

"Thursday on ABC’s “The View,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich acknowledged the Trump administration “didn’t mobilize the first couple of weeks,” of the coronavirus pandemic. Co-host Meghan McCain asked, “There was an article out in The New York Times this morning that talks about how all the doctors in the country this morning are writing their wills and having to change it because the people they’re close to are either too old or fellow doctors and may die. Some people have resorted to wearing garbage bags because they don’t have the right supplies or gear. I’m furious. Most Americans are furious. This seems like a referendum on many things, but especially the preparedness we have for a crisis like this. what went wrong, and what can average Americans watching in horror do to help?” Speaking from his quarantine in Italy, Gingrich said, “I think until you’ve experienced a pandemic like this, you always discount it. Without getting into politics in the last administration when we had the H1N1 virus, we used an amazing number of masks, and they were told, you need to go out and buy a bunch of masks. They didn’t do it, so the stockpile wasn’t rebuilt.” On the Trump administration, Gingrich said, “In this administration, I think they didn’t really they didn’t mobilize the first couple of weeks. I do a podcast every Sunday, and we had Dr. Fauci on in early February. He knew things were not going right. He knew there was this thing coming out of China, and it was dangerous.

"American Conservative Union (ACU) chairman Matt Schlapp said on Thursday that the Kennedy Center, which will receive a $25 million bailout as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package unanimously passed by the Senate, should either return the money or “redirect it to a DC charity helping victims” of the coronavirus. The Senate unanimously passed the historic emergency relief bill late Wednesday night after days of partisan turmoil. Both sides came to an agreement on Wednesday on a bill that, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) have indicated, differs very little from the original measure Democrats rejected on Sunday. While the bill contains immediate relief for the American people, including cash payments, the expansion of unemployment coverage, and loans for small businesses, it also contains $25 million for the Kennedy Center for the Arts in Washington, DC. Schlapp is calling on Kennedy Center chair David Rubenstein to take action and either “return the $25 million in the soon-to-pass Cares Act or redirect it to a DC charity helping victims.” “Show us You care,” he added: To show respect for the many Americans suffering economically or fighting for their health due to the Corona virus I call on Kennedy Ctr Chair David Rubenstein to return the $25 million in the soon to pass Cares Act or redirect it to a DC charity helping victims. Show us You care — Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) March 26, 2020  President Trump has admitted that the Kennedy Center’s $25 million bailout is a “lousy soundbite” but channeled the sentiment of others who note that Democrats failed to pack the final bill with the host of liberal pet projects demanded by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). “I said, ‘That’s a lousy soundbite; that’s not a good soundbite,’ but that’s the way life works,” Trump said, noting that Democrats originally requested $35 million. He commented: I approved that, and I knew — it was $35 million, and we actually took off 10, but I’m a fan of that, although I haven’t spent time there, because I’m far too busy. I’d love to go there evenings, but I’m too busy doing things because that’s more important for me than going there, but the Kennedy Center has suffered greatly because nobody can go there. It’s essentially closed, and they do need some funding. However, Trump reiterated that the money for the Kennedy Center was not his request. “I said, look, that was a Democrat request. That was not my request, but you’ve got to give them something. It’s something that they wanted. You know, it works that way — Democrats have treated us fairly,” he said. “I really believe that we’ve had a very good back and forth, and I say that with respect to Chuck Schumer.

"U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Woody Johnson has placed blame on China for the coronavirus pandemic devastation that is sweeping the world, saying the country “tried to suppress the news.” Johnson’s comments came in an op-ed for the British newspaper the Times on Thursday. Johnson claimed China “tried to suppress the news” of the coronavirus as it appeared in a Wuhan city wet market. He went on to claim that Beijing only shared select information with international officials as the virus spread. Johnson wrote: Had China done the right things at the right time, more of its own population, and the rest of the world, might have been spared the most serious impact of this disease. When the crisis finally abates we should take stock of the outcome and evaluate the costs of this breakdown in international collaboration. Multiple Chinese officials have claimed that the coronavirus originated in the United States, a conspiracy theory that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Yang Jiechi, director of Beijing’s Office of Foreign Affairs, not to promote. “It is bad enough when conspiracy-theory cranks spread dangerous misinformation around the world. It is far worse, and more dangerous, when malign misinformation is spread by a government’s officials,” Johnson wrote in the op-ed. “That is exactly what the People’s Republic of China has been doing, spreading false accusations about the origin and spread of the coronavirus,” Johnson added. A  Harris poll released earlier this week found a majority of the American people believe the Chinese government is to blame for unleashing the Wuhan coronavirus upon the world. The poll concluded 55 percent believe China is to blame for the virus versus 45 percent who did not agree. Fifty-two percent agreed with Trump’s use of the term “China Virus,” while 42 percent did not.

"(AFP) — The lockdown in the Chinese outbreak city of Wuhan brought the Covid-19 epidemic crashing to a halt, giving health systems crucial breathing room to deal with serious cases, new research showed Thursday. Chinese authorities ordered schools, universities and businesses shut following a cluster of Covid-19 cases in the transport hub in January, confining millions of people to their homes in a bid to contain the outbreak. The measures sent the numbers of new cases tumbling, and parts of Hubei province, where Wuhan is situated, have slowly started returning to normal. With roughly three billion people currently advised to stay at home amid the pandemic, a study published in The Lancet Public Health examined what the rest of the world can learn from Wuhan. Researchers developed a model to estimate the impact that school and business closures had on COVID-19 transmission rates, using data on how often people interact and where. The Wuhan outbreak came at the worst possible time — on the eve of Lunar New Year, when tens of millions of Chinese travel to celebrate with their families. The study compared three separate scenarios: no intervention and no holiday travel; no physical distancing and normal holiday travel; and school closures with only key workers at work. They found that intervention in form of school and business closures had a significant impact in reducing new cases, buying vital time for health systems to process the spike in cases. The team also predicted the impact of lifting control measures. Their models suggested that waiting until April to lift social distancing would reduce total infections by a quarter. It would also delay a second peak of the virus from August to October, again buying health workers vital time. “The unprecedented measures the city of Wuhan has put in place to reduce social contacts in school and the workplace have helped to control the outbreak,” said lead author Kiesha Prem from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “However, the city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases. But if they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.” Commenting on the research, James Gill, honourary clinical lecturer at Warwick Medical School, said it had “profound” implications for countries seeking to learn lessons from the Chinese Covid-19 response. He said the study showed the “sought-after ‘flattening of the curve’, along with the reduction of total cumulative infections, whilst also demonstrating a delay in the peak of the outbreak by two months.” Coronavirus: Thugs Mugging Nurses for Their IDs to Get Free Food and Drink https://t.co/N5zjiaKTDB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 26, 2020  ‘Avoid new waves’  A study from Britain’s Imperial College this month showed that Covid-19 case numbers could be brought under control via extreme social distancing measures but were liable to rebound once such restrictions were relaxed. Yang Liu from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Lancet study co-author said that the Wuhan example was unlikely to be replicated exactly elsewhere. “But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection when workers and school children return to their normal routine,” she said. “If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems”. Tim Colbourn from University College London said the research was “crucial for policymakers everywhere. “Given many countries with mounting epidemics now potentially face the first phase of lockdown, safe ways out of the situation must be identified,” said Colborn, who was not involved in the study.

"As Rahm Emmanuel famously instructed the Democratic Party 2008:  “Never allow a crisis to go to waste.”  He repeated the phrase Sunday, in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. They are heeding his words, now more than ever. Many Democrats are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to launch a full-bore push for socialism—making the socialist rhetoric of the early Democratic presidential debates look tepid by comparison. Not surprisingly, Bernie Sanders has been among the most vocal, lamenting the lack of centralized control in the American healthcare system. As he said in the most recent Democratic presidential debate: “We’ve got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people in a good year, without the epidemic.” For Sanders and the Democratic Left, the coronavirus demands a centralized, national health care system. No more private insurance, private clinics, or private hospitals. Never mind that the communist country that unleashed this plague upon the world was the epitome of centralized control. And of course, this is on top of Sanders calling for the nationalization of the energy industry last August. He claimed that was the only way to combat climate change. His supporters are equally committed to the socialist cause. As speaker Kshama Sawant declared at a Sanders rally in Washington State: “[W]e need to elect Bernie and we need a new party of, by and for working people. We need a powerful socialist movement to end all capitalist oppression and exploitation.” And it’s not just Sanders. New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio has demanded “a nationalization of crucial factories and industries that could produce the medical supplies to prepare this country for what we need.” Other Democrats across the country are also embracing their inner socialist. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has created a state-controlled hand sanitizer factory, and he has threatened to use the power of the state to control prices. It may be a small industry, but it’s textbook socialism.  Another common facet of socialist systems is the imposition of price controls. Here too, Democrats are using the coronavirus to justify this measure. House Democrats Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), and 46 other Democrat members signed a letter calling for price controls on drugs related to treating coronavirus patients. Many on the Left are also calling for massive expansions of the welfare state that have little or nothing to do with the coronavirus. This is what the socialist Left has been demanding for decades. Their demands aren’t about bringing the coronavirus crisis to a swift close; they are about enlarging the dependency class. They are exploiting the coronavirus for all it’s worth. These steps to socialism are being sold as urgent reforms to address the coronavirus. To be sure, many thousands of Americans are now furloughed or out of work; and businesses are struggling to stay afloat. The federal government under President Trump’s leadership has done a great deal to effectively respond to the crisis and support struggling Americans and their businesses. But that does not mean that private sector industries should be nationalized or that the power of the federal government should be increased. On the contrary, private companies are stepping up to meet the demands of the crisis. For example, General Motors and Tesla have begun producing ventilators. Their ability to launch massive production far exceeds what any government agency might accomplish. And only a robust private sector free from government regulation will be able to pull the American economy out of the impending recession when this crisis is over.

"President Donald Trump announced Thursday plans to release criteria for the coronavirus threat by county. The president explained his plan in a letter to America’s governors, a copy of which was shared with reporters. “This is what we envision: Our expanded testing capabilities will quickly enable us to publish criteria, developed in close coordination with the Nation’s public health officials and scientists to help classify counties with respect to continued risks posed by the virus,” Trump wrote. Each county would get a federal category of “high-risk,” “medium risk” and “low risk,” Trump wrote, using data-driven criteria that would be used to develop further government guidelines. The new plan suggests that the president is eager to loosen the restrictions on certain areas of the country to allow some Americans to return to normal life. The president thanked Americans for responding to the initial strict guidelines released on March 16, 2020, to fight the spread of the coronavirus. “I want to thank each of you, along with your frontline responders and essential workers, for stepping up to help America confront this unprecedented global pandemic,” Trump wrote. New guidelines, he explained, would be released by his administration to inform state and local governments about the risks and guidelines they should expect especially after collecting weeks of data about the virus. “This new information will drive the next phase in our war against this invisible enemy,” he wrote.",Donald Trump Prepares Criteria for United States Coronavirus Threat by County,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/donald-trump-prepares-criteria-for-united-states-coronavirus-threat-by-county/,Breitbart
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) expressed outrage on Thursday that the cash payment portion of the economic relief package, which the Senate unanimously passed Wednesday night, does not extend to noncitizens. The Senate unanimously approved of the historic coronavirus emergency relief measure on Wednesday evening after days of partisan battles. As many Republican leaders have stated, the passed bill remains virtually the same as the original bill Democrats rejected on Sunday. It provides aid for small businesses, creates a lending aid program, and delivers cash assistance directly into the pockets of American citizens. The bill will provide most American adults with $1,200, $500 of which is for most children. Ocasio-Cortez, however, is taking issue with the stipulations — specifically, the requirement of a Social Security number. “To clarify, $1200 checks are ONLY going to some w/social sec numbers, NOT immigrants w/ tax IDs (ITINs),” she wrote following the Senate’s unanimous 96-0 approval of the bill,” adding, “Thanks to GOP, these checks will be cut off the backs of *taxpaying immigrants,* who get nothing.”: To clarify, $1200 checks are ONLY going to some w/social sec numbers, NOT immigrants w/ tax IDs (ITINs). Thanks to GOP, these checks will be cut off the backs of *taxpaying immigrants,* who get nothing. Many are essential workers who pay more taxes than Amazon. Wall St gets $4T — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 26, 2020  Ocasio-Cortez’s complaint extends to those who are residing in the country illegally, as illegal immigrants can also obtain an ITIN. The Tax Policy Center found that the vast majority of American households, roughly 90 percent, will benefit from the checks. The New York lawmaker also proclaimed the GOP is refusing to fund hospitals or unemployment, despite the fact that the bipartisan bill provides $100 billion for hospitals and the vast expansion of unemployment benefits: What Trump + Senate GOP have done is hold hospitals, working people, and the vulnerable hostage so they could get in $500 billion (that will be leveraged into $4T) in corporate welfare. Without the Wall St giveaway, GOP refuses to fund hospitals & unemployment. It’s inhumane. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 26, 2020  The House is expected to vote on the bill on Friday. “On Friday, the House will take up the legislation with strong bipartisan support,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said, crediting Democrats for revamping the bill — a claim House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) called an “outright lie“: “She added $24 million more dollars to the Kennedy Center. I happen to sit on the board. I support the Kennedy Center, but this is not the place and time to hold a bill up for the health care of America to provide money for the Kennedy Center,” he said during a press conference on Thursday. “That was wrong, but that’s what her win was. It didn’t extend any of the unemployment insurance. That was already decided on Sunday,” he added.",Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Upset Cash Relief Does Not Extend to Noncitizens,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-upset-cash-relief-does-not-extend-to-noncitizens/,Breitbart
"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that quarantining everyone together in New York City is probably not the best pubic health strategy in the fight against the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. “What we did was we closed everything down. That was our public health strategy. Just close everything,” Cuomo recalled. He admitted during his daily press conference that he might have done things differently. “If you rethought that, or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don’t know that you would say, ‘quarantine everyone,'” he said. “I don’t even know that was the best public health policy.” He suggested that younger people quarantined with the elderly might have spread the virus more quickly. “Young people then quarantined with old people was probably not the best public health strategy,’ he said. “Because the younger people could have been exposing the older people with an infection.” Currently, there have been 385 deaths from coronavirus in New York City. Cuomo said that going forward, he would work on a “smarter” strategy, possibly allowing younger people and people who have recovered from the virus to go back to work. He noted that both the state of New York and the federal government were both trying to decide how to get people back to work in a way that did not threaten lives or risk outbreaks in the rest of the country. “We have to do both,” he said.",Gov.

"The coronavirus pandemic is turning sections of the populace into tinpot fascists. I call them #CovidNazis. Today I’ve been running a Twitter competition to see who can find the most egregious example. #CovidNazis This is a competition to see who can find a recent tweet that best exemplifies the intolerance/ Stasi-like snitching/bureaucracy gone insane/vindictive hysteria/poundshop authoritarianism that have emerged as a result of the #Coronavirus crisis. Ready…Go! — James Delingpole QC (@JamesDelingpole) March 26, 2020  The competition has been stiff. Many times over the years, I’ve debated that perennial question with friends: “If Britain had been overrun by the Nazis, what percentage of the population would have been collaborators and how many would have been resistants?” Now we know. Lots and lots of people would have eagerly snitched on their neighbours, sucked up to the authorities, and generally welcomed the firm hand of the new tyranny. Elements of the police — as we’re about to see shortly — would have worked with an excess of zeal to prop up the new regime. Obviously I’m not comparing Boris Johnson with Hitler, nor Britain’s quarantine with the kind of strictures enforced in Nazi Germany. What I am saying, definitely, is that I’ve seen an aspect of my countrymen and women that I hoped I’d never have to see: an ugly, pettifogging, nitpicking, curtain-twitching, intolerant, judgemental, shrill, mean-spirited, vindictive authoritarianism of which they all ought to be ashamed. The lockdown which has been loosely enforced since Monday this week has, inevitably, caused widespread inconvenience and irritation, especially to those who live in the city. It’s hard, particularly if you haven’t got a garden, to get exercise and fresh air in urban environments. No wonder people are starting to feel cribbed, cabined, and confined. Yet astonishingly, instead of trying to make it as easy as reasonably possible for people to get their daily, officially permitted piece of exercise, the authorities in many cases are clamping down and actually making green spaces unavailable to them. Many if not most London parks have now been closed. So too, outrageously, have whole swathes of the British countryside. There are reports even of the car parks to remote Scottish beaches being shut so that no outsiders can drive there for a quiet stroll. In Wales — which has an abundance of open countryside — that Mickey Mouse institution calling itself the Welsh government has decided to close footpaths lest walkers get too close to one another. Here are the details from the National Trust website: In accordance with these Regulations relevant authorities, including the National Trust, are required to close certain public footpaths during the emergency where it considers that: • (a) such public footpaths will be liable to large numbers of people congregating or being in close proximity to each other, or • (b) the use of such public footpaths poses a high risk to the incidence or spread of infection with the coronavirus. These Regulations expire at the end of the period of six months beginning with the day on which they come into force, however, the Welsh Ministers must review the need for restrictions imposed by the Regulations every 28 days. The public footpaths will be kept closed until it is considered that closure is no longer necessary to prevent, protect against, control or provide a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection with the coronavirus. Can you imagine the ugly, bureaucratic mindset of the third-rate gimps responsible for this nonsense? How likely is that even a single person, in the open air, is going to infect someone else with coronavirus while brushing past them on a country walk? But the prize for the most egregious, small-minded, mean-spirited behaviour during this lockdown just has to go to the police. For years, Britain’s police forces have proved themselves incapable of many things — catching burglars, stopping knife crime, stopping gangs of Muslims raping girls — but when it comes to stopping people popping out for an illicit country stroll, boy, are they on top of the situation.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden hosted a “Happy Hour with Young Americans” livestream Wednesday night and only 2,800 people tuned in, according to a CBS news reporter. .@JoeBiden wrapping up his first virtual happy hour w/young Americans. There were about 2800 simultaneous viewers throughout the chat. #lit — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) March 25, 2020  Meanwhile, millions and millions and millions of Americans, some 12 million on TV alone, and millions more online, are watching President Trump’s daily press briefings about the coronavirus. The far-left New York Times, which is obviously worried about how these briefings have improved the president’s job approval rating, is now openly suggesting the briefings not be broadcast live, so that the fake news media can filter out what they don’t want the public to see. Anyway, once Biden’s pathetic hour-long Happy Hour was over, the total viewers tallied 141,000, but that number counts the number of people who watched anywhere from 30 seconds and up. In other words, if someone tunes in for 31 seconds, gets bored and shuts it off, they count in that 141,000 number. What we do know for a fact is that only 2,800 on average watched the full hour, which is simply pathetic. Biden, who broadcasts these livestreams from his basement, is so personally inept and has hired such an inept team, they not only cannot draw any viewers, they only figured out how to livestream this week! Biden is almost certainly going to be the 2020 Democrat nominee, and he still disappeared for two weeks because he couldn’t figure out this whole InterWebNetsDotThing. It’s simply unbelievable. This disastrous Happy Hour also streamed on YouTube, where it received a pathetic 23,693 additional views (as of this writing) — which again counts viewers who only watch for 30 seconds. Better still, the up and down votes are absolutely brutal: only 696 up votes for Biden’s Happy Hour, and 1,700 down votes. What’s more, Joe Biden has his own YouTube channel, and that YouTube channel has only 19,000 subscribers. For comparison, President Trump’s YouTube channel has 310,000 subscribers. Viewership for Biden’s other livestreams has been just as pathetic. On Wednesday, Biden delivered 35 minutes worth of remarks “on the impact of the Coronavirus on Young Americans.” It barely reached over 10,000 YouTube views and received as many down votes as up votes — 326 to 332. Three days ago, Biden earned only 134,000 views on YouTube and 211,000 views on Twitter for his “remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic,” which received 974 up votes and 4,300(!) down votes. But again, if 2,800 average viewers adds up to 141,000 total viewers for that Happy Hour video, what does 343,000 viewers equal? Maybe 7,000 average viewers? However you want to slice this, this is a massive failure of leadership on Biden’s part. While running for president in 2016, Trump didn’t need a fancy livestream to be heard while competing against 16 other Republicans for the nomination. And he didn’t sit around watching Matlock reruns waiting for a studio to be built in his basement. Trump jumped on the phone; he called into every show that would have him to get his message out. He hustled and improvised and took every question, no matter how hostile… Meanwhile, Biden sits around at home giving dull speeches and making dull statements, and pretending to be president while he basically plagiarizes the ideas Trump has already put into action. I’ve never seen anything like this. Biden is shrinking before our very eyes, and is doing so because he’s too old, has no good ideas, and is afraid to participate in the freewheeling interviews that will capture the public’s attention and juice their excitement. If he wanted, Biden could be all over the media, but he’s afraid to take questions and it’s fairly obvious that at the advanced age of 77, he tires easily. So what we have here is the presumptive Democrat nominee, who’s basically a crazy old man jumping online in-between naps so he can pretend to be the president in front of an audience of, LOL, thousands. Biden’s abysmal ratings, and the lack of excitement and energy around his livestreams, tells us something else… That there is no leadership vacuum in this country. People do not feel the need to turn to Biden or anyone else during this crisis. Trump is doing just fine, thank you very much… In fact, the world is ignoring Biden almost entirely. He’s a non-entity. Meanwhile, the actual president not only leads us through this terrible time, he spends hours every day taking countless questions from a hostile media. That’s leadership.

"Thursday on CNN, the Trump administration’s trade and manufacturing policy director Peter Navarro sparred with anchor Brianna Keilar over a lack of protective equipment available for healthcare professionals as a result of heightened demand during the coronavirus outbreak. Keilar asked, “In fairness, the government was clearly ill-prepared for this. This is not something that, you know, these viruses happen and how awful they are. Your government knew in the summer when they did a drill, if this happens, this would be a problem, and there was a lack of preparation, which was why we have you onto talk about the sly supply chain. It looks like it is going to be about 200,000 ventilators and what experts are saying there could be a million needed. Are you going to be able to meet that demand? Navarro responded, “Let me bring you up on the history here of what we inherited. In ’09 when the Obama administration —”
Keilar interrupted, “Peter, why are you wasting your time on this and not solving the problem that we have?” Navarro shot back, “I am trying to respond, and you keep on interrupting me… Let’s have this conversation. You keep on talking in my ears, and you won’t let me talk. May I speak, please?” Keilar said, “Will you answer the question? Can you get to a million ventilators?” Navarro said, “You started by saying this administration was ill-prepared. Let me explain to the American people this whole stockpile, which was engineered for a basically 100-year flood, and we got here with the coronavirus to 500 years flood. That’s the problem. We have woken up to the fact that we did not have adequate material in our stockpiles, and more importantly, all of our supply chains is spread out in the world at a time 10 out of top countries providing us with pharmaceuticals are imposing export restrictions. We are running as fast as we can to get the people of America what they need and searching for incredible amounts of materials in places like New York as we speak. We are having the most rapid industrial mobilization since World War II. We are doing the best we can. Don’t tell me we were ill-prepared for this because he inherited the system of testing and inherited of stockpiles that was inadequate for this, and there was plenty of people to the last two administrations who had a wake-up call, and they went back to sleep. That’s not what we are doing. We’ll fight this.” Keilar said, “You’re wasting everyone’s time with this. It’s 2020. The president was elected in 2016. can you get to a million ventilators?” After heated crosstalk, Navarro said, “Why do you keep shouting in my ear? I don’t understand. I’m trying to —” Keilar said, “You’re not answering.” Navarro said, “Watch me answer the question. We got 43,000 ventilators, at least that are coming from Phillips. We work with GM and Vent Tech, and they may be able to produce as many as 80,000 by the end of the year. Ford and GE are partnering together and eight other companies on our spreadsheets where we’re looking to get them to take up production, whatever inventory they’ve got. We’re working really hard on this and surging capacity at the places they need it. I think what’s important for CNN here is to report this in a sober way, without frightening America, and just having reasonable conversations when somebody from the White House comes on instead of just shouting in our ear.” Keilar said, “Peter, I will tell you that one way that I think a lot of people are calming down is when they have information, and even if it’s bad news, they know the size of the problem and the government has a plan for it. That’s what we’re trying to get with you. You’re in charge of the supply chain. That’s the most pressing issue right now. I don’t know that I actually have too much of a clearer picture having spoken to you today.” Navarro said, “If I may, when you lead with, your administration was woefully unprepared, do not expect me to accept that as fact. It’s not a fact, okay, but you should at least let me respond to it. Your administration is woefully unprepared, now, how many ventilators do you have? I mean, that’s a two-parter, right? So I’ll come on CNN any time. All I ask is civil dialogue where I have the time to speak and that we deal with the facts and just keep asking CNN, it’s like, this is the crisis of our lives. You will never experience anything like this again in your lifetime, and we need, as a people, to band together and work with this in a unified way, above party, above partisan politics, above ideology, and just solve this problem together. If we get on TV and get sensationalized and stir people up, it just leads to bad things. That’s my point. We are working as hard as we possibly can with the full force of government and the full force of private enterprise, and that’s the best we can do right now. We all, as a country, have got dealt a bad hand by China.” Keilar shot back, “Peter, that is just a waste of time to say that. I’m going to leave it there, Peter Navarro. We’re just trying to get our hands around it. Peter Navarro, that’s it, we’re out of time.” Navarro said, “No, hang on.

"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said on Thursday that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told an “outright lie” when she proclaimed that Democrats performed jiu-jitsu to change the economic relief package unanimously passed by the Senate late Wednesday. “A few minutes ago, the speaker stood at this podium and claimed that House Democrats did what she called a jiu-jitsu to change the bill,” McCarthy said during a press conference on Wednesday. “That is an outright lie.” The fundamental portions of the bill, McCarthy stressed, were not different than the original measure Democrats rejected on Sunday: “Four months for unemployment was already decided on Sunday. The grant to keep employees hired by small businesses was already decided on Sunday. The only few additions were funding of things that had nothing to do with the coronavirus.” “Was that worth holding it up and more people being laid off? More people losing sleep? More people wondering if they can continue? Those are the type of games that have to stop in Washington,” he continued, blasting Pelosi for “thanking her members on wins” and noting that Americans suffering are not interested in hearing those “superficial and fabricated claims.” He continued: What Democrats did was a total disgrace. History will not be kind to the days that added to the millions who are unemployed simply because they wanted to change the election law, put a Green New Deal, and thought it was a tremendous opportunity to change the direction and vision of this country based upon their philosophical beliefs. Pelosi only has a claim to one victory, McCarthy said: $24 million more dollars to the Kennedy Center. While the minority leader said he supports the center, sitting on the board, he reiterated that it was not appropriate to hold up aid to the American people over funds for that: “That was wrong, but that’s what her win was. It didn’t extend any of the unemployment insurance. That was already decided on Sunday,” he said. “She added union provision, and she added money for the Kennedy Center,” he added. He continued: I believed at the end of the day this should just focus on the health, safety, and security of Americans when it came to the coronavirus. Let’s make sure that those hospitals got the resources. Let’s make sure those who are laid off, they got money to pay their rent so we don’t have a real estate challenge. Or those who were laid off, let’s incentivize the small business owner to actually bring them back on. How do you do that? Government is providing the resources as a grant to rehire them or the incentive to keep you working as we get through this virus so we’re stronger on the other side. “We just watched 3.28 million Americans get a question and answer they did not want to hear when they went to work while we watched Democrats stall a bill that could have solved that problem,” McCarthy added.",Kevin McCarthy: Pelosi’s Claims of Doing ‘Jiu-Jitsu’ to Change Relief Bill Are ‘Outright Lie’,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/kevin-mccarthy-pelosis-claims-doing-jiu-jitsu-change-relief-bill-outright-lie/,Breitbart
"Actor Michael Rapaport shared another angry rant on social media Wednesday evening, demanding President Donald Trump encourage his children, including 14-year-old son Barron, to leave their houses and potentially expose themselves to the Chinese coronavirus.

"Thursday on MSNBC, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said it was an “abject failure of leadership” given that President Donald Trump resisted calls to enact the Defense Production Act to get the federal government involved in the production of medical supplies for the heightened demand during the coronavirus outbreak. Host Stephanie Ruhle asked, “What is the rationale behind the president not enacting this which would force production?” Harris said, “I’ve been asking the same question, and I don’t understand it, and when confronted with it, he tells Schumer, our Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on the telephone, hey, activate it, and then the next day he’s saying, I’m not Venezuela. I’m not going to take over as a socialist government. I don’t think he gets it. I don’t think he gets it.

"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is defending his decision to refrain from issuing a statewide stay-at-home order in the Sunshine State, stressing the importance of taking a more “surgical approach.” His defense comes as local officials in Orange County, Florida, issue a stay-at-home order, as confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus continue to rise in the state. “It’s not clear to me that doing a massive shutdown of an entire state would even work,” DeSantis said this week, contending that a sweeping order could negatively impact areas of the state not heavily affected by the virus. “There’s certain parts of the state where you have more sporadic cases,” he said during a press conference at Florida’s Logistics Response Center in Orlando on Wednesday. “To order someone not to be able to earn a paycheck when them going to work is not going to have any effect on what we’re doing with the virus, that is something that I think is inappropriate,” he continued, stressing the importance of a “surgical approach.” “We obviously have an outbreak in southeast Florida, so they’ve gone to a stay-at-home. I worked with them on that,” he added. DeSantis’s strategy has been to leave more aggressive measures up to localities, and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings seized on that this week, formally issuing a stay-at-home order taking effect Thursday at 11 p.m. ET. The order will span two weeks, expiring April 9 at 11 p.m. ET. Essential businesses will remain open. Like other stay-at-home orders across the country, those include grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, gas stations, and healthcare providers. The Florida governor has, however, taken a series of steps to slow the spread of the virus in his state, including ordering a 14-day quarantine for those traveling from the New York Tri-State area. He also implemented a 30-day closure of nightclubs and bars and suspended restaurant dine-in services and elective medical procedures. “We have a special obligation to protect the groups of people who are elderly or those with a serious medical condition,” he said.

"Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is asking residents to tattle on their neighbors if they believe they are violating the governor’s stay-at-home order. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) issued the order March 24, which bans travel and work, except for “essential” reasons, in an attempt to stifle the spread of coronavirus. It lasts through April 13. Now, Nessel is urging Michiganders to contact local law enforcement if they believe their neighbors are breaking the order. “These are unprecedented times and my office is working with Gov. Whitmer’s office, local law enforcement agencies and other parties to ensure these executive orders are being followed,” Nessel said in a statement. She continued: The orders are in place to protect the public health and welfare of Michigan’s residents, and consequences will result to those found to be in willful violation. By working together through this public health emergency and staying home, we can help slow the spread of COVID-19 across the state. Nessel asked residents to contact her office to file reports of “price-gouging and scams” but any other violations should be registered with police. “For other violations of the Governor’s executive orders, please contact the law enforcement agency where you reside,” the statement read. “We’re all in this together and we are counting on every resident to do everything they can to stay safe, stay healthy and stay home,” Nessel said. Meanwhile, calls to 911 in other parts of the country are already on the rise. WCBS reported: FDNY commissioner Daniel Nigro says calls to 911 have spiked about 50 percent amid the coronavirus pandemic. The excess calls are putting a strain on 911. “Our members are keeping up, but barely,” Nigro said. “I ask for the public’s help to please don’t over use 911. Use it for when you have to.” Authorities in Louisiana are asking residents to call 911 only in emergency situations. Via WAFB: Officials with East Baton Rouge Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are asking the public to stop calling 911 for non-emergency situations. Brad Harris, a spokesperson for EMS, says you should only call 911 for life-threatening situations, such as cardiac arrest, unconsciousness, stroke, heart attacks, seizures, and other critical conditions. “If a caller is found to have non-life threatening symptoms potentially related to COVID-19, the medics will assess the patient and contact a healthcare provider for instruction,” Harris told the news station. Violators of Whitmer’s stay-at-home order could pay a $500 fine or be jailed for 90 days. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) repeatedly criticized President Trump’s response to the coronavirus and the White House’s broader political strategy in the months prior to praising the president’s approach to the outbreak. On March 7, Cuomo told MSNBC that Trump is sending “mixed messages” regarding the coronavirus pandemic. “Forget what you’re hearing from the federal government,” he said, advising the public to ignore federal authorities. He simultaneously stated a desire to mitigate public panic rooted in fears of governmental incompetence: There are no mixed messages, only political weaponization by people like you and your brother, Fredo! https://t.co/NqH4pHfuwt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020  During a March 16 press conference, Cuomo denounced what he described as a lack of “national leadership,” further accusing the Trump administration of inadequately centralizing the country’s efforts. “It makes no sense” for different states and cities to have varying responses to the threat, assessed Cuomo, calling for a one-size-fits-all standard without accounting for varying conditions between states. Without mentioning Trump’s name, Cuomo called for the president to provide national guidelines to governors and mayors. “Let the federal government say these are the guidelines,” Cuomo stated. “Here are the guidelines on schools. Here are the guidelines on businesses. Here are the guidelines on travel. Rather than having a scramble of every local government, state government, trying to figure it out on its own. It makes no sense.” Cuomo took to Twitter to repeat his call for Trump to deploy national standards to all states and cities: I have to do more?   No — YOU have to do something!  You’re supposed to be the President. https://t.co/tYeDt1lcOZ — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) March 16, 2020  Via Twitter, Trump responded to Cuomo’s call for a nationwide implementation of standards: Cuomo wants “all states to be treated the same.” But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big “hotspot”, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2020  On Wednesday, Cuomo framed Trump as responsible for an anticipated shortage of ventilators across New York. Politico wrote: “The president says it’s a war,” Cuomo fumed, his voice rising at a press conference at the Javits Center, the massive Manhattan convention hall now being turned into an emergency hospital. “Well then act like it’s a war!” Faced with New York’s need for 30,000 ventilators to keep virus patients alive when the spread of the virus peaks – which could happen in as soon as two weeks – the federal government had sent 400 from its stockpile. “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,” an angry Cuomo demanded. In 2015, Cuomo opted against the purchase of 16,000 additional ventilators, explained Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York. She wrote: After learning that the state’s stockpile of medical equipment had 16,000 fewer ventilators than New Yorkers would need in a severe pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo came to a fork in the road in 2015. He could have chosen to buy more ventilators. Instead, he asked his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, to assemble a task force and draft rules for rationing the ventilators they already had. New York is now rationing ventilators by having two coronavirus-stricken patients share a single machine to address the shortage of units. After Trump changed his primary residence to Florida from New York in late 2019, Cuomo disparaged the president while claiming the real estate developer did not pay New York state taxes: Good riddance. It’s not like @realDonaldTrump paid taxes here anyway…  He’s all yours, Florida. https://t.co/9AX0q1aBkQ — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 1, 2019  Trump’s politics are “repugnant” to New Yorkers, alleged Cuomo in November 2019, dismissing the president as not being a “real New Yorker” and framing him as a racist. “[America] was never that great,” claimed Cuomo in an August 2019 speech, mocking Trump’s “Make America Great Again” 2016 presidential campaign slogan. Of all states, New York has the highest number of coronavirus infections. Asked why the Empire State has such a volume of infections relative to others, Cuomo said, “Because we welcome people from across the globe. We have people coming here…we have people who came here from China, who came here from Italy, who came here from all across the globe.” News media outlets such as the Associated Press, CNN, New Yorker, New York Times, and Washington Post have praised Cuomo’s response to the coronavirus outbreak while critiquing Trump’s. Cuomo became “the politician of the moment” and “has emerged as an authoritative voice in the crisis,” asserted the New York Times. “Everyone needs to see Andrew Cuomo’s inspiring words on the fight against coronavirus,” urged CNN. According to CNBC, 385 people have died from the coronavirus infection in New York, with nearly 40,000 confirmed cases across the state.

"The coronavirus pandemic has many wondering what lies ahead with regards to the United States’ relationship with China. Former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama, argues it will be China suffering in the long-term. During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN on Thursday, Tuberville offered his assessment of where things are headed with regards to Mainland China, noting the communist giant was going to take a hit. “It’s a different world we live in, and we better start recognizing that,” he said. “Our politicians are giving our country away through NAFTA — just pushing things to other countries and not make anything here. I think this is going to help us in the long run. I think we’ll move manufacturing back here. I think it is really going to hurt China. I think China really showed its spots. People have known it for years. But now it has really came out in the open that they lied about this. And it’s going to cost them probably trillions of dollars in terms of manufacturing moving out. You can’t trust these folks.” The football coach-turned-politician argued China had wielded too much influence over Washington, D.C. in the past. “Why in the world would we ever trust a country — number one, they’re communists,” Tuberville continued. “They kill their own people. We’ve seen it on television through Tiananmen Square and Hong Kong. They had those things going on, but we still trust them. It all goes back to the little bubble, the little piece of land we call Washington, D.C., and they live on their own up there. They don’t look out for anybody other than themselves. There’s no telling how much money has been funneled from China back to that little piece of dirt up there in Washington, D.C., and people that work there. There is no telling over the years. But I tell you one boy that’s getting ready to stop it, and he already started three years ago: His name is Donald J. Trump.” Tuberville said he credits President Donald Trump with what could be China’s ultimate demise. “He recognized it because he is a businessman,” he added. “He has seen it over the years and said this has got to stop. And so, I think you’ve seen China brought to their knees to the point where they might not recover in our lifetime because they have really shown what they’re really about. And we can do without them. I’m looking forward to the day when we don’t rely on anything coming from China.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","Tuberville: Trump, Coronavirus Have Brought China to Its Knees — ‘They Might Not Recover in Our Lifetime’",2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/26/tuberville-trump-coronavirus-have-brought-china-to-its-knees-they-might-not-recover-in-our-lifetime/,Breitbart

"TEL AVIV – In a dramatic day for Israeli politics, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his erstwhile rival Benny Gantz made an alliance deal as Gantz was voted in as Knesset speaker, prompting his Blue and White party to split up in protest. Gantz was voted in as Knesset speaker with the full support of the right-wing bloc plus some Blue and White Knesset members with a full 74 MKs. Eighteen voted against.  Yesh Atid, Labor and Yisrael Beytenu MKs boycotted. Gantz will likely resign from his post after a unity government is formed with Netanyahu’s Likud party, and he is expected to be given a senior portfolio. Israeli media reported that Gantz will be offered the post of foreign minister before taking up the premiership in a rotation deal with Netanyahu in September 2021. A Likud MK will reportedly then takeover as Knesset speaker. Blue and White, comprised of Gantz’s Israel Resilience party, Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid and Moshe Ya’alon’s Telem party, splintered off in three directions. Israel Resilience joined the government, Lapid will lead the opposition and Telem has disintegrated with Ya’alon out and renegade MKs, Tzvi Hauser and Yoaz Hendel, reportedly in. Lapid wished his former fellow partt members good luck and left that party’s WhatsApp group. His Yesh Atid party and Telem requested to keep the Blue and White name as per the Knesset filing since they have more MKs than Gantz’s splintered Resilience party. “Gantz decided to crawl into Netanyahu’s government,” Lapid complained. Meretz MK Tamar Zandberg slammed Gantz for uniting with Netanyahu. “You’ll end up a rug under the feet of an alleged crook, an inciter and racist,” the far-left politician said. “We’re standing here in shock trying to internalize the depth of the deception… the disaster you’re inflicting on millions of voters [who backed] the left-democratic bloc… who sought an alternative [to Netanyahu]. “What have you done, Benny Gantz? How can you do this to the millions of voters who supported you?” she said, adding that her party “will have no part in this.” Labor MK Merav Michaeli similarly blasted Gantz. “You wanted to be Yitzhak Rabin but you ended up like another former IDF chief of staff Shaul Mofaz, a nice man but a caricature of a politician who gave into Netanyahu and whose career ended shortly afterward,” she said. Channel 12’s pundit Amit Segal said on Thursday evening that the new coalition would also include the Labor party which would split from its alliance with Meretz. Chili Tropper of the Resilience Party will be handed the justice portfolio and Gabi Ashkenazi will become defense minister, according to Segal’s report.  ",Holy Land Drama: Blue and White Splits after Gantz Joins Netanyahu Government,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/26/holy-land-drama-blue-and-white-splits-after-gantz-joins-netanyahu-government/,Breitbart
"The Service Employees International Union said it has located 39 million N95 masks and will be facilitating the sale of them to healthcare providers. Via SEIU: The union launched an exhaustive search for masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) five days ago in response to pleas from frontline healthcare workers that they need more protection and feel unsafe on the job as they treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients. SEIU-UHW has 97,000 members who work in hospitals across California. Within 48 hours of painstakingly calling leads and potential suppliers, the union discovered a distributor who had the 39 million masks, and has since found another supplier who says his company can produce 20 million more masks a week. The union also has found a supplier who can deliver millions of face shields. The union said it will be selling the masks to states, counties and hospitals for $5 apiece and claims it “has no financial interest in the transactions.” Similar N95 masks are available on the Home Depot website for $23.97 for a box of 20, or about $1.20 apiece. The unidentified supplier said it has already sold some of the masks to the state of California, the Greater New York Hospital Association, Dignity Health, Kaiser Permanente, Stanford Health Care, Sutter Health, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Clara counties, according to KNTV. amNewYork reported NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital “is burning through 40,000 N95 masks per day.” The chief of surgery expects that number to grow to 70,000 per day.

"More than six million tablets of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by the Israeli drug company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. have arrived in the U.S. and are currently being shipped to national wholesalers to be distributed to American hospitals, a spokesperson for Teva confirmed to Breitbart News. Ten million tablets in total are slated to arrive in the U.S. within a month as part of Teva’s donation. The antimalaria drug has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for Chinese coronavirus and experts say there is a theoretical basis that it could have a treatment role.  Some doctors who say they have used hydroxychloroquine sulfate in conjunction with other medications have seen positive developments in Chinese coronavirus patients. Scientists say more trials are needed before determining the possible effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in Chinese coronavirus treatment. Still, some doctors are already prescribing the drug on and off-label since they argue the side effects are usually not that strong and there is no time to wait for long-term data. Hospitals are reportedly seeking to stockpile the drug in anticipation of a flood of coronavirus patients and many pharmacies say they are experiencing a massive number of prescription requests for hydroxychloroquine sulfate. New York State began clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine on Tuesday along with zithromax and chloroquine. Teva is one of the world’s largest makers of hydroxychloroquine. A spokesperson confirmed earlier reports that the company would ship six million tablets to wholesalers for distribution to U.S. hospitals by March 31, and more than 10 million within a month. The spokesperson said six million tablets have already arrived in the U.S. and are being distributed to hospitals by three national wholesalers – ABC, Cardinal and McKesson. “We are committed to helping to supply as many tablets as possible as demand for this treatment accelerates at no cost,” said Brendan O’Grady, Teva Executive Vice President, North America Commercial. “Immediately upon learning of the potential benefit of hyroxychloroquine, Teva began to assess supply and to urgently acquire additional ingredients to make more product while arranging for all of what we had to be distributed immediately.” Trump has repeatedly touted the use of hydroxychloroquine treatment combined with the antibiotic azithromycin, hailing the combination at press conferences and in a series of tweets. Some doctors promote the combination of that cocktail with zinc and an antibacterial. ….be put in use IMMEDIATELY. PEOPLE ARE DYING, MOVE FAST, and GOD BLESS EVERYONE! @US_FDA @SteveFDA @CDCgov @DHSgov — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2020  “What do we have to lose?” Trump said at a press conference Saturday when speaking about the drug’s possible use in the current pandemic. “We’re going to find out very shortly whether or not it is going to work. I feel very confident.” “At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of chloroquine,” Trump said during a press conference earlier this week. “We think tomorrow, pretty early, the hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak I think is a combination is looking very, very good and it’s going to be distributed.” The publicity has led to a surge in demand for hdyroxychloroquine, which is FDA approved as a treatment for malaria. The drug has the apparent ability to block some cellular processes involved in the replication of viruses, including coronaviruses as a broad group although its exact effectiveness in Chinese coronavirus is still being studied. In addition to combining it with the azithromycin antibiotic, some doctors are using hydroxychloroquine sulfate in combination with zinc sulfate. The hydroxychloroquine sulfate is thought to serve as a bridge to force open cells, including those susceptible to coronavirus, allowing the zinc to penetrate and help line the cell walls in protection against coronavirus. The treatment combination is not believed to kill coronavirus. Instead it could protect cellular lining from further penetration.  This could mean that if it does work, the drug cocktail would likely have more success in patients who are in the initial stages of infection and could be less effective in those who are already in critical condition. According to Drugs.com, common side effects of hydroxychloroquine include: Patients are urged to call their doctor if they develop: In advocating for hydroxychloroquine sulfate, many have pointed to a limited French study that had positive results. The AP reported: The French study has attracted the most attention. Doctors gave hydroxychloroquine to 26 people with confirmed coronavirus infections, including some with no symptoms. Six also were given the antibiotic azithromycin. Some of the 26 were not counted in the final results because they didn’t complete the study — what’s known as “lost to followup” — but that included three who worsened and were sent to intensive care, one who died a day after later testing negative for the virus, and one who stopped treatment because of nausea. After six days, no patients given hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin had virus detected in swabs from the back of the nose, versus 57% of those given the malaria drug alone and 12.5% of some other patients who received neither drug. The journal Nature Medicine reported on lab tests that demonstrated the drug blocked coronavirus’ ability to enter cells but that doesn’t mean the same would be repeated in human trials. And a report from China claimed chloroquine helped more than 100 patients. An “expert consensus” document from China stated: “Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome.” Some doctors who have used hydroxychloroquine in the U.S. to treat Chinese coronavirus have been cited in news media reports as documenting successes. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office announced the state obtained 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine in the last few days for trial use. “We hope for optimistic results,” Cuomo said during a press conference Tuesday about the tests. “The president and the FDA accelerated that drug coming to New York so the hospitals will start using that drug today.” “I’ve spoken with a number of health officials and there is a good basis to believe that they could work,” Cuomo said. “Some health officials point to Africa, which has a very low infection rate and there’s a theory that because they’re taking these anti-malaria drugs in Africa, it may actually be one of the reasons why the infection rate is low in Africa. We don’t know, but let’s find out and let’s find out quickly.” Some scientists, however, have had mixed opinions about the drug’s effectiveness for the current pandemic. “It is a very weak study … leaving us in suspension of whether the combination strategy has any merit,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. He was talked about the French study. “It could very well be that the drug is reducing viral shedding but having no impact on the clinical course of those patients,” said former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. David Goldman, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore, told Bloomberg News that although the French study “isn’t optimal and doesn’t constitute enough data to validate the new indication for that drug,” it does combine many years of the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat outbreaks of SARS and MERS. “Nobody really knows what will work, so let’s try everything: multiple different approaches, multiple different agents, based on the limited data that we have,” Goldberg said.

"An unidentified citizen called out New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) for availing himself of armed protection even as he issued a coronavirus lockdown order that resulted in the suspension of gun sales in the state. The citizen said, “Your executive actions closed down gun stores, saying they’re ‘non-essential.’ The poorest minorities living in the most dangerous cities with the highest crime rates now have absolutely no way of buying a firearm. I’ve lived in Newark, so I understand this first hand.” He asked, “If less guns reduce crime, will you give up your personal bodyguards?” The governor replied by intimating that he and the citizen had a philosophical difference in the role guns play, with the governor believing “a safer society has fewer guns, not more guns. And the guns that do exist are in the hands of the right people — particularly trained members of law enforcement.” The governor then giggled, referenced an armed law enforcement member next to him, and said, “It is what it is.”     A gun owner asked NJ @GovMurphy about his order to stop firearm transfers.

"The U.S. Navy is fighting to contain a coronavirus outbreak at sea in the Pacific Ocean, aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. Navy officials have confirmed at least eight positive cases discovered aboard the ship of more than 5,000 sailors, according to the Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday. “We are taking this threat very seriously and are working quickly to identify and isolate positive cases while preventing further spread of the virus aboard the ship. No Sailors have been hospitalized or are seriously ill,” he said in a statement on Thursday. He said the medical team aboard the ship is performing testing for the crew. “We are isolating those who test positive. Testing will continue as necessary to ensure the health of the entire ship’s crew. In addition, the medical staff will continue to actively monitor the health of the crew. Deep cleaning of the ship’s spaces is also ongoing,” he said. The ship is headed to Guam for a previously-scheduled port visit, Navy officials said. There, sailors will continue to be tested, isolated, and treated if necessary. Gilday said the Navy expects more positive tests and that sailors will be brought to U.S. Naval Hospital Guam for further evaluation and treatment if necessary. Other sailors will be restricted to a pier. “We’re taking this day by day. Our top two priorities are taking care of our people and maintaining mission readiness. Both of those go hand in glove,” Gilday said. “We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region.” Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said Thursday that the entire crew will be tested for coronavirus. He said the first three sailors who were identified as positive and flown off the ship earlier this week “are currently doing fine,” and none of them have required hospitalization. “Their symptoms are very mild, they are aches and pains and those types of things, sore throats, but nothing that required hospitalization. So they are in quarantine now on Guam,” he said. Modly said five more sailors were flown off after that and several others are in isolation. The Daily Beast reported on Thursday that there were 23 positive cases aboard the Roosevelt. Navy officials said they are looking into how the sailors contracted the coronavirus. The Roosevelt had stopped in Vietnam 15 days ago, but Gilday said earlier this week that when the sailors were allowed off the ship, there were only 16 positive cases of coronavirus in Vietnam that were further north up the coast from where the sailors had docked in Da Nang. The U.S. Navy has four large deck ships at sea. So far, the Roosevelt is the first ship at sea to have cases of coronavirus aboard. Navy officials say that sailors are practicing social distancing aboard ships and that going forward, Gilday said every port visit has been canceled except for ships that need to pull in for maintenance or resupply.

"A judge with United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered a review and could bring operations to a halt of a pipeline in North Dakota that has been successfully operating for the past three years since President Donald Trump kept a campaign promise to get oil and gas pipelines online, which had been repeatedly delayed during the Obama administration. Judge James Boasberg wrote that the easement approval for the pipeline is “highly controversial” and a “more extensive review is necessary than the environmental assessment that was done,” the Associated Press (AP) reported. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Mike Faith told AP it a “significant legal win.” The tribe claims the pipeline threatens polluting water supplies. “Perhaps in the wake of this court ruling the federal government will begin to catch on, too, starting by actually listening to us when we voice our concerns,” Faith said in a statement. “Craig Stevens, spokesman for the GAIN Coalition, a group that supports large infrastructure projects, said the decision could jeopardize the nation’s economic and energy security,” AP reported. “This is a stunning decision that flies in the face of decades of widely accepted practice,” Stevens said in a statement. “The Dakota Access Pipeline is already the most studied, regulated, and litigated pipeline in the history of our country and has been safely operating for nearly three years.” A fact sheet from Energy Transfer, which operates the pipeline, describes it: The Dakota Access Pipeline is a 1,172-mile underground 30″ pipeline transporting light sweet crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois. Safely operating since June of 2017, the Dakota Access Pipeline now transports 570,000 barrels of oil per day. The pipeline is the safest and most efficient means to transport crude oil from the geographically constrained region, providing better access to Gulf Coast and Midwest refineries and other downstream markets. The Dakota Access Pipeline created approximately 8,000 to 12,000 jobs during construction. It put highly skilled union mechanics, electricians, pipefitters, heavy equipment operators and others within the heavy construction industry to work. Local economies benefited from workers using hotels, motels, restaurants and other services. And since the start of operation, the pipeline has been paying millions in property taxes to states each year. These tax dollars have been used to support schools, hospitals, emergency services and other critical ongoing needs. We remain an active member of the communities the pipeline traverses, which is a core aspect of our business. AP reported on what might come next: It’s not clear whether the ruling will shut down the pipeline. Boasberg ordered both parties to submit briefs on whether the pipeline should continue operating during the period of the new environmental review. The pipeline was the subject of months of protests, sometimes violent, during its construction in late 2016 and early 2017 near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The Standing Rock tribe continued to press litigation against the pipeline even after it began carrying oil from North Dakota across several states to a shipping point in Illinois in June 2017. AP interviewed environmentalist activists who oppose fossil fuel, including Jan Hasselman, a attorney with the leftwing Earthjustice which represents he Standing Rock tribe. The group said the Obama administration “had it right” in its efforts to block the pipeline.

But it’s not related to the coronavirus. That’s why it’s not in the bill. The emergency bills that we may have to pass in the future need to be related to the subject.

"The United States is relying on rubber glove imports from mostly Malaysia and Thailand in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus, with no clear path for manufacturing the critical medical supply in the U.S. About three-in-five, or 60 percent, of rubber gloves today are made in Malaysia, while the U.S. is making close to none, according to industry insiders who spoke to Breitbart News. The coronavirus has hit Malaysia’s supply chains, making it increasingly difficult for foreign factories to keep up with the demand – an issue for the U.S. as rubber gloves are vital to protecting healthcare workers and patients from infection. Data from 2017 shows the U.S. imports about 91 percent of its rubber gloves from Malaysia and Thailand. The U.S. exports less than 0.4 percent of rubber gloves to other countries. Industry insiders told Breitbart News that only DipTech Systems in Kent, Ohio, is available to provide the machinery needed to manufacture rubber gloves today in the U.S. but that production may not be able to begin for up to 18 months. The potential scarcity of rubber gloves in the U.S. is just the latest medical necessity that has underscored the nation’s crippling reliance on foreign countries through a 30-year free trade agenda. Similarly, about 80 percent of pharmaceuticals imported to the U.S. arrive from Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, India, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, United Kingdom, and Japan. Around 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients imported to the U.S. arrive from China and India, and 95 percent of ibuprofen and 70 percent of acetaminophen imported to the U.S. arrive from China.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) is bragging about the number of inmates he is releasing from prison in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis while car theft skyrockets in the city. While New York now has nearly 40,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 400 deaths, de Blasio bragged about the increasing number of inmates he is releasing, noting that by Friday morning, about 375 will have been released from city jails and prisons. “Our city jail population is now 4,906. That’s the fewest detainees we’ve had in our jails since 1949,” de Blasio wrote on Twitter. “By tonight, the number of inmates released in response to the COVID-19 crisis will go from 200 up to 375. We will continue to address this in the safest way possible.” At the same time, while New Yorkers are ordered to stay home, grand larceny auto has skyrocketed during the pandemic. In the last week, alone, grand larceny auto was up more than 51 percent across New York City compared to 2019 totals. This week last year, there were less than 70 grand larceny auto cases. This year, there have been 103 grand larceny auto cases from March 16 to March 22. Over the past month, grand larceny auto cases are up nearly 80 percent in New York City compared to the same time in 2019. While it is good news overall crime dropped this week, it is extremely concerning that Grand Larceny Auto rose by 51.5% when an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers are at home with their cars.

That specific provision has already been blamed for the murder of a 36-year-old witness who was expected to testify against MS-13 gang members in a criminal trial. The murder occurred after the witness’s name was handed over to attorneys representing the accused. Federally, a group of 14 Republican and Democrat Senators has pleaded with the Department of Justice to free felons in federal prison who are 60-years-old or older.

"Thursday on CNN, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said her city was given “no red flag” from Homeland Security, FBI or the CDC to cancel the Mardi Gras celebrations to help stop the spread of coronavirus. She argued the agencies follow the “response of our national leader,” who Cantrell said was not taking it seriously. Anchor Wolf Blitzer said, “Experts say, Mayor, that the Mardi Gras celebrations at the end of February in New Orleans may have actually played a role in accelerating the spread of this virus. More than a million people came to your beautiful city at the time. We are showing some video of that right now. At the time, Mayor, did you have any guidance from health experts on the potential risk of coronavirus?” Cantrell answered, “Well, you know that the city of New Orleans as it relates to Mardi Gras, we plan Mardi Gras as a year-long effort. Around a part of our unified command is the federal government. Homeland Security, as well as the FBI. So in reaching out, meaning my health directors and public safety officials, every step of the way consulted with federal partners as well as the CDC in reference to COVID-19.” She continued, “The federal government did not issue any red flags and, therefore, we moved forward with federal agents being a part of our unified command on the ground. And with the first time the city of New Orleans for Mardi Gras, we’re at a rating that was an improvement given to us by the federal government. So every step of the way, the federal government has been partners with us with Mardi Gras. No red flags were given. So absolutely, we moved forward.” Blitzer said, “Yeah, you certainly did. I’ll ask you the same question I asked your governor yesterday with hindsight. We are all obviously a lot smarter with hindsight. Do you think Mardi Gras could or should have been closed this year?” Cantrell said, “Well, if red flags were given at the federal level, leadership matters. So while I was the first in the state of Louisiana to stop social gatherings, I had to cancel the St. Patrick’s Day Parade. All hell broke loose when I did that. It was necessary, giving the data, allowing science to lead us. It does matter. We rely on the facts to make decisions for the people that we serve. Given no red flags, we moved forward. In hindsight, if we were given clear direction, we would not have had Mardi Gras, and I would have been the leader to cancel.” Blitzer said, “I know, I guess reports are within a week or two after Mardi Gras, all of a sudden the cases started emerging in Louisiana. Obviously, that’s very disturbing.” He asked, “You are saying no one from the federal government came to you and urged you to at least can sell or postpone Mardi Gras?” Cantrell responded, “That’s absolutely correct. And not only that, it was backed up with the response of our national leader. When it’s not taken seriously at the federal level, it’s very difficult to transcend down to the local level in making these decisions. But when the experts told me that social gatherings would be an issue, I moved forward with canceling them, as well as St. Patrick’s Day parade, as well as our Super Sunday, where our Mardi Gras Indian’s parade, the suits that they’ve made, all year long, so this is something that not only concerns us, but it sets the tone for how leadership matters at every level of government in the United States of America, where mayors on the front line.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",New Orleans Mayor on Coronavirus: Trump Admin Should Have Warned Us to Stop Mardi Gras,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/26/new-orleans-mayor-on-coronavirus-trump-admin-should-have-warned-us-to-stop-mardi-gras/,Breitbart
"Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers are suing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) over his ban on the procedure during the coronavirus pandemic in order to preserve medical supplies for healthcare personnel who are treating victims of the infection. “There are people in Texas who need an abortion today. Now,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, reported the Hill. “They cannot wait a delay of 30 days or even less.” .@GovAbbott doesn't think abortion is essential or, apparently, time-sensitive. He's wrong. So: we're suing, with our friends at @ReproRights and The Lawyering Project. See you in court. pic.twitter.com/FIQJeKgK4l — Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) March 25, 2020  The abortion providers are represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Lawyering Project. “Abortion, which is an essential, time-sensitive medical service cannot be delayed,” McGill Johnson said in a press statement. “A global pandemic is not some kind of opening to attack abortion. Gov. Abbott and anti-abortion activists nationwide are forcing a legal and political fight in the middle of a public health crisis.” The priority of Planned Parenthood health centers is ensuring that every person can access essential health care while conserving needed resources. @GovAbbott's priority should be the same.  We cannot stand by as he puts the health of our patients and the community at risk. https://t.co/hE2NbCdHGP — Alexis McGill Johnson (@alexismcgill) March 26, 2020  However, Dr. Christina Francis, the chair of the board of the American Association of Prolife OB/GYNs (AAPLOG) says moving forward with abortions during the coronavirus pandemic is “medically irresponsible,” at a time when medical equipment is much needed to treat those who are sick. “Abortions use up much-needed resources such as masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment,” Francis recently told LifeSiteNews. Francis’s organization is one of five groups of physicians that, collectively, represent over 30,000 doctors and medical professionals who are condemning the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ (ACOG) representation of abortion as essential health care. The coalition of medical groups said in a statement: In such an uncertain and tumultuous time, the entire healthcare profession is being called upon to conserve resources and healthcare professionals to an extent never seen before. And yet, in the midst of this call, while hospitals are postponing elective procedures and many outpatient clinics are rescheduling non-essential office visits, the abortion industry continues with business as usual. The coalition of physicians’ groups further states: Elective abortion is neither “essential” nor “urgent,” but it does consume critical resources such as masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment, and unnecessarily exposes patients and physicians to pathogens. The doctors note that continuing abortions – some of which are likely to develop complications – place greater stress on a healthcare system that is under tremendous pressure at the current time: Most abortion providers instruct women to go to an emergency room if they have any concerning symptoms after the abortion. Approximately 5% of women who undergo medication abortions will require evaluation in an emergency room, most commonly for hemorrhage. Surgical abortions can also result in hemorrhage. Emergency room personnel – who are already struggling to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic – will be further strained to provide care to these women. We must work together as Texans to stop the spread of COVID-19 & ensure that our health care professionals & facilities have all the resources they need to fight the virus. Those who violate @GovAbbott's order will be met with the full force of the law.https://t.co/B5agHEh3Jq — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) March 23, 2020  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton confirmed Monday Abbott’s order halting abortions during this time: “[A]ll licensed health care professionals and all licensed health care facilities shall postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician.” This prohibition applies throughout the State and to all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary, including routine dermatological, ophthalmological, and dental procedures, as well as most scheduled healthcare procedures that are not immediately medically necessary such as orthopedic surgeries or any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. “We always knew the abortion industry really didn’t care about women’s health, but this lawsuit proves it again,” said Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins: Leaders in Texas and other states have called for abortion vendors to cease operations so that life-saving equipment can be used to address the coronavirus crisis. But as the rest of the country fights to save lives, Planned Parenthood runs to court to end lives. Dr. James Dobson, president of the James Dobson Family Institute, praised Abbott and Gov. Mike DeWine (R) of Ohio for stopping abortions in the midst of the current crisis and called on other governors to do the same. “Our nation and our world are in the midst of a pandemic that is claiming thousands of lives, and the U.S. is taking drastic measures to protect people during this unprecedented time,” he added, and he asked, “So why are abortionists seeking to operate business as usual?”",Planned Parenthood Sues Texas Governor over Abortion Ban During Coronavirus Outbreak,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-governor-over-abortion-ban-during-coronavirus-outbreak/,Breitbart
"Dr. Deborah Birx on Thursday provided encouraging coronavirus numbers suggesting that some of the predictive models were incorrect. “There’s no model right now, no reality on the ground, where we can see that 60-70 percent of Americans are going to get infected in the next 10-12 weeks,” she said. Without specifically naming the Imperial College, Brix referred to models that predicted there could be 500,000 coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom and 2.2 million deaths in the United States. The scientist of the model revised the estimate of deaths in the United Kingdom to be roughly 20,000 people or fewer. Birx said that the actual data coming in from other countries were different than some of the direst projections. She noted that in major countries, there was never an attack rate of over one in over 1,000 people. “The predictions of the models don’t match the reality on the ground on either China, South Korea, or Italy,” she said. Birx also addressed reports that raised the alarm of New York City hospitals running out of ICU beds, ventilators, and creating “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR) policies for patients.

Curry interviewed Trump’s pandemic adviser in a 20-minute live Instagram event where he asked his own questions as well as those from fans watching the interview live. One of the most urgent questions on the minds of many basketball fans is when the league will be back on the court? “What you need to see is the trajectory curve starting to come down,” Dr. Fauci said of the number of new cases. “We can start thinking about some degree of normality when the country as a whole has turned that corner and starts going down, so you can pinpoint cases instead of getting overwhelmed like New York City,” the doctor added.  Curry also asked if all the quarantine efforts across the country were doing anything worthwhile to curb the virus.

"President Trump’s travel bans on China, Iran, Europe – as well as closures at the southern and northern borders – are the most popular policy initiatives the White House has enacted to fighting the Chinese coronavirus, a new survey reveals. Pew Research Center’s latest survey finds that of all the precautions taken by federal and state governments, about 95 percent of Americans said “restricting international travel to the U.S.” is the most necessary action to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. This includes about 96 percent of Republican voters and 94 percent of Democrat voters who said travel bans are vital to fighting coronavirus — making it the most popular policy initiative among Americans overall. (Pew Research Center) As Breitbart News has reported, Trump has closed the southern and northern borders to migrant entry and travel, as well as imposing travel bans on China, Iran, and Europe to stop recent visitors and nationals from those countries from flying into the U.S. Many have called for a full immigration moratorium and across-the-board travel ban to prevent new arrivals and foreign nationals from entering the U.S. amid the coronavirus crisis. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ordered an international travel ban that effectively stops all foreign air travelers from entering Canada.

"Private equity firms are reportedly using the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to cheaply buy up businesses, which will have a crippling impact on America’s small business owners. While small and medium-sized businesses struggle to stay afloat in the midst of the coronavirus crisis — awaiting aid from the federal government — reports indicate that private equity firms on Wall Street “have been waiting” for economic devastation to capitalize on those hardships.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and a top ally of President Donald Trump, told Breitbart News exclusively on Thursday that he is calling on governors, especially those in red states, to develop a fix to an unemployment loophole in the massive $2 trillion coronavirus rescue passage the Senate passed Wednesday night. The bill, for which Graham and 95 other senators voted, passed the U.S. Senate unanimously on Wednesday evening. It only got 96 votes because four GOP senators are quarantining due to either having coronavirus or concerns they might have been exposed. The bill is expected to pass the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday morning via voice vote, House leaders say, and will make its way to President Trump’s desk, where he is expected to sign it. The bill contains many positive things to help rescue the economy, including direct payments to many Americans as well as funds for a variety of industries and loans for small businesses that will be forgiven, assuming they maintain their workforces. But one particular part of the bill, Graham told Breitbart News, represents a potential serious threat to the economy as a whole—and he said that while he voted for the overall package, this problem needs to be fixed soon. “There’s a lot of good stuff—that’s why I voted for it,” Graham told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday afternoon. The problem, the senator explained, is that this bill includes an additional $600 per person per week if they are laid off or unemployed. The federal government has never had a federal unemployment program, as those matters and benefits have been handled by the states until this bill. The issue here, however, as Graham explained, is that in some cases people may end up—by collecting unemployment checks from both their state and the federal government—making more money per week during the four-month duration of this novel federal unemployment program than they would should they keep their job. “I was willing to reimburse people—to supplement unemployment benefits to their actual wages up to $50,000,” Graham said. “Make you whole. The unemployment benefit in South Carolina is $326. So the federal government created the $600 supplement for every state. My goal was to make people whole up to around $48,000 or $49,000. What’s happened here is if you make $30,000, you’re going to wind up getting reimbursed under unemployment up to $48,000. Your weekly pay will go from a $30,000 salary to a $48,000 or $49,000 salary.” In the state of South Carolina, for instance, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit, Graham said, is $326 a week. So people who are laid off due to the coronavirus crisis would collect that, plus an extra $600 per week from the federal government under this bill. Given the unique nature of the coronavirus crisis—which is the fault of no American—Graham said his and other senators’ goal is to ensure that people are “made whole,” in that they get their whole salary through these expanded unemployment benefits. But, he is concerned that this loophole in the program, where the states and federal government are not in sync with each other, may end up making it such that somebody makes more money by collecting both unemployment benefits than they would by working. “Let’s use South Carolina as an example—$326 a week is the maximum benefit,” Graham said. “I want to be more generous than that. We have a $600 federal pot. If you’re making $30,000 a year, I don’t know what that is a week. About $576. So you should go from $326 up to $576, but under the way the bill is written, you’d get $600 on top of the $326. That incentivizes people not to work, because the computer can’t make the adjustment, which is bizarre to me because to get the unemployment benefits you have to give the agency information on your wages—what you make at work—and who your employer is.” In other words, somebody making $30,000 a year in South Carolina could end up making more than a $48,000 salary during the four months in which this program is in place. That makes the average hourly wage of collecting unemployment under this system in South Carolina around $23 an hour—more than many well-paying jobs in the state. The issue is similar, with different numbers, in other states. That could have an adverse effect on hiring—as companies like Amazon, which is reportedly looking to hire right now, would be competing against the government paying higher wages for not working than they can afford to pay for somebody to work. “The average hourly wage for unemployment benefits in South Carolina would be $23.14 an hour,” Graham said. “So if you’re making $15 working, you look like a chump. So, bottom line is it’s going to be difficult for people to hire because they’re competing with a $23 an hour government wage. So, like Amazon wants to hire 100,000 people? They’d probably take $14 or $15 an hour. But they’d have to jack their wages up, which would affect the entire economy. So this artificially incentivizes people to stay out of the workforce and it makes hiring in certain areas of the economy almost impossible due to the technological glitch.” If someone were making more than that—say $30 or $40 an hour—Graham says, “you would only go on unemployment if you were laid off.” “But here’s the really perverse incentive: The average household income in South Carolina for a couple, a family, or household is $51,000. Under this bill, if you have a husband and wife—if they’re making $51,000 together in combined income—under this bill, each one would get $926 or whatever it is and they would go from a household income of $51,000 to over $90,000. The incentive for the couple is to not go to work for four months.” What Graham wants to happen is for anyone affected by the coronavirus crisis to make their full salary if they are laid off during it. But what he does not want is the government making it such that people make more money by collecting unemployment benefits than by working. In other words, he wants to set it up in states whereby the state unemployment benefit would match their salary—whereas currently the state provides people a benefit that is less than their full salary. The full $600 extra from the federal government should match up to what someone is making, but not have them making more than when they were employed. “We want to make them whole, but we want to not have a system where they make more money to not work,” Graham said. “I was the first Republican to reach across the aisle and say ‘let’s beef up unemployment.’ I never dreamed that we’d come up with this system. I never dreamed that we would have a system that pay people not to work. I wanted to make them whole, people in the low level of the economy. But it went the other way. In South Carolina if you combine the two, it’s $23 an hour. Ted Cruz told me in Texas it’s $28 an hour. So, a lot of people are not making $28 an hour in Texas.” The issue, Graham said, is the state unemployment systems—which are different in each state—are months away from modernizing payment structures and technology to be able to make people whole but not pay them more to not work. “Here’s the problem. The reason we can’t do this apparently is, they tell me, that state unemployment insurance systems can’t do this,” Graham said. “We land two men on the moon, but I’ve been told it’s going to take six to eight months for state unemployment insurance systems to be able to cut a check for the difference between a state unemployment benefit and your actual income. That to me is astounding, that in the 21st century state unemployment systems can’t make this adjustment in less than six or eight months. Now, what does that mean? It means for the next four months, we’re going to have an incentive to leave the workforce.” Graham said that the problem needs to be fixed as soon as possible, because if the virus resurges in the fall, even after public health efforts by the Trump administration vanquish it this go around, then the country may need to turn back to this system as a solution again. “So I am not going to tolerate this as the answer for the country,” Graham said. “The virus will probably come back in the fall, and this will hit us all over again and when there’s a big spike in unemployment due to the containment policies we face a Hobson’s choice here. With 3.3 million unemployment claims announced this morning, it’s probably going to get worse here. So it’s imperative that we fix this so that we don’t incentivize people to leave the workforce. We need to fix this because this problem is going to be with us for a very long time.” So to answer the problem, Graham said, he is calling on Republican governors nationwide and red state insurance commissioners to develop a solution that can serve as a model for the nation. “So what I’m going to do when we get back is create incentives for states to fix this problem, so that you get made whole but you don’t get a pay raise,” Graham said. “I am looking for a conservative governor to show the country how to do this. I believe that a governor that can figure out, a state unemployment commissioner that can figure out how to fix the system is going to get rewarded by the federal government, but it’s also going to help the economy. Under the current system you’re literally paying people more not to work.” Graham has not, since this interview with Breitbart News on Thursday afternoon, spoken with any governors yet, but he intends to begin doing so soon, starting with South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. “I’m going to start with my governor,” Graham said. “I was told by [Eugene] Scalia: Y’all need to call somebody at Labor. There are rules on the books that won’t be followed. The rules are you can’t get unemployment if you quit, so if people leave their jobs to get more unemployment that’s not going to be enforced. You need a small army to enforce that. Employers are not going to throw their people over. So I hear about all the way the law works, I live in the real world—I live on Main Street—and I know exactly what’s going to happen here. If you make $23 an hour not to work for four months, most people will probably do that.” Graham said he’s confident that somewhere in America, a governor or insurance commissioner will solve this problem. “Somebody will invent a software that can be widely applied,” Graham said. “Then again—in Bernie’s world, Bernie Sanders’ world, I’m being mean. But I think we’re being smart, because most Americans would prefer to work, and most Americans want to pay their government to pay people more to work than not to work. In Bernie’s world, that’s fine—he’s okay with a $23 an hour minimum wage.” Then, when a state develops a solution, Graham will take that back to Congress and offer it up for the whole country. “Then I get the Congress to basically revisit this issue and take the solution and spread it around and give people 30 days to implement, and give them money to help implement it, and if they don’t they’re going to lose some of that benefit,” Graham said. “Carrots and sticks.” Graham said the coronavirus pandemic has exposed a previously unknown vulnerability in the state-run unemployment system, and now with the federal government creating its first-ever such program—even though it’s temporary—those weaknesses are being thrust into the spotlight. “Our state unemployment system was like our testing system: It wasn’t set up to deal with a pandemic,” Graham said. “Well, this may not be the last one we have and this thing may come back in the fall so we have to fix it now. Every day we go forward it puts pressure on the economy. You can’t really regenerate because you’ve created a perverse incentive for people to be out of the workforce.” That’s why Graham is hopeful that a state somewhere in the union, probably one with a GOP governor, will sort this out. “We’re making a call to arms here to see if we can get some state to figure this out, so we can make people whole but not create an incentive to get out of the workforce, because this is a real problem and people will be incentivized not to go back to work, and people who need to hire are going to have a hard time of it,” Graham said.",Exclusive—Sen.

"Thursday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network political commentator former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) called President Donald Trump a “joke” and a “chump.” The panel was discussing the Trump campaign sending out cease and desist letters to television networks to stop airing a Priorities USA ad. Anchor Nicolle Wallace said, “Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is sending out cease and desist letters to local TV stations threatening legal action if they continue to run that ad that we just aired for you. It’s paid for by a left-leaning political action committee. The Trump campaign says the audio is manipulated and that Trump never called the virus itself a hoax. In response, Priorities USA says they’re going to expand their ad buy. No matter who his campaign threatens to sue, Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic has undoubtedly become the campaign issue. Joe Biden’s campaign has a new ad that’s nearly two minutes long playing Trump’s initial efforts to downplay the virus and his attacks on the media.” She continued, “Claire McCaskill, I have long wrestled with this question of how much of Trump to show in covering him, but this is an instance where Trump makes the own case against himself by talking about the media, by attacking reporters who ask questions on everyone’s mind, by putting out information that contradicts the things that Tony Fauci says sometimes from the same briefing. What do you make of it as a political ad?” McCaskill said, “First of all, it’s an effective political ad, the best ads are ads where the person is actually speaking and makes the point for themselves. Nobody is manipulating his voice there. That’s what he said. Now, the cease and desist orders, Nicole, as you well know, what a joke. I mean, the fact that he is paying someone to make these threats, shows you what a chump he is.” Referencing toilet paper, McCaskill continued, “He thinks he’s some brilliant business guy. He’s wasting money of his campaign or his own money hiring lawyers because you and I both know the cease and desist orders, fact, they could sell them for what we’re in short supply of right now.” She added, “It is silly that he thinks he can get that ad taken down. I think you’re going to see a lot more of that kind of advertising as this cycle goes on because Trump said these things. He did these things, and it is — he is probably the most powerful case that Joe Biden has in terms of his campaign for president.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Claire McCaskill: ‘What a Joke’ — ‘What a Chump’ Trump Is,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/26/claire-mccaskill-what-a-joke-what-a-chump-trump-is/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump’s Justice Department (DOJ) is backing a lawsuit by three female athletes who say their sex-based Title IX rights are violated by the forced inclusion of “transgender” males in their high school competitions. On Wednesday, the DOJ issued a “statement of interest” in response to a lawsuit filed by three high school athletes in Connecticut challenging rules that allow individuals to compete in sports based on “gender identity” rather than biological sex. The DOJ’s statement says the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC) rewriting athletic qualifications undermines the protections granted women through the federal Title IX law. The statement reads: Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The DOJ’s statement addresses why the Connecticut rules discriminate against female athletes: Title IX and its implementing regulations prohibit discrimination solely “on the basis of sex,” not on the basis of transgender status, and therefore neither require nor authorize CIAC’s transgender policy. To the contrary, CIAC’s construction of Title IX as requiring the participation of students on athletic teams that reflect their gender identity would turn the statute on its head. The conservative advocacy group American Principles Project (APP), which has worked in recent years to fight against the movement to allow biological men to compete against biological females in sports, issued a statement on Thursday. “What a difference an election can make,” Terry Schilling, executive director of APP, said in the statement. “Just four years ago, the Obama administration was threatening schools with a loss of funding if they failed to allow biological males to participate in girls’ sports.” “This was total insanity, and yet it unfortunately spread to many states like Connecticut, which adopted policies eliminating a fair playing field for women athletes,” Schilling said. “Now, high school girls are being forced to sue in order to preserve their rights under Title IX.” “Thankfully, the Trump administration has proven to be a strong defender of equal opportunities for women, and this DOJ action is just the latest example,” Schilling said. “As Democrats continue their push to wipe out women’s sports through legislation such as the so-called ‘Equality Act,’ we encourage President Trump and Republicans to keep opposing these efforts and supporting girl athletes.” APP also announced it would pay for ads on this topic during the 2020 presidential election season. The case is Soule vs. Connecticut Association of Schools, Inc., No. 3:20-cv-00201 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.

"Companies, hospitals, and doctors can now use a variety of unapproved and experimental machines and techniques to breathe air into asphyxiating coronavirus patients, according to a March 24 announcement by the federal agency responsible for licensing medical equipment. A March 24 statement from the Food and Drug Administration said: This Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is being issued in response to concerns relating to insufficient supply and availability of FDA-cleared ventilators for use in healthcare settings to treat patients during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)1 pandemic. Rear Admiral Denise M. Hinton, the agency’s chief scientist, said: I have concluded, pursuant to section 564(d)(2) of the Act, that it is reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of the authorized ventilators, ventilator tubing connectors, and ventilator accessories, when used consistently with the Scope of Authorization of this letter (Section II), outweigh the known and potential risks of such products. The letter gives doctors and hospitals a safe pass for good faith experimentation with the nation’s limited stock of ventilators, said James Evans, CEO of Automedx, a Texas-based firm that supplies compact and sturdy ventilators to the Pentagon’s combat units. The agency is telling “everyone out there [who] is trying to do good that ‘We’re not going to slap you on the hand if you hurt someone you’re trying to help,'” Evans said.  Evans said he is hoping to win a contract from the government for the mass production of his book-sized ventilator, which can help people recover from lung damage caused by the coronavirus.  A task force is readying the plan for ventilator production at the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency will likely call for the production of a wide range of machines, including high-end devices for hospital care, simpler breathing aids for conscious people, tougher devices that can be in storage for the next crisis, and rudimentary devices for quick production. This week, Congress provided billions of dollars for the production of ventilators and other equipment. “We think that we’re in a good position to build … tens of thousands of units in 15 weeks,” Evans said, adding, “We’re just waiting to hear what HHS wants to do.” The crisis is going to last 18 months, partly because that is the expected development time for a vaccine, he said.  The scale of the problems was outlined in a March 25 article in the New York Times: As hospitals prepare for a flood of desperately ill patients unable to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilators have become the single most important piece of equipment that can mean the difference between life and death. … The United States currently has between 160,000 and 200,000 ventilators, but could need up to a million machines over the course of the outbreak, according to the Society of Critical Care Medicine. In New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., hospitals are already on the verge of running out, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. The nation’s huge medical industry also has many ventilators and breathing devices that can be pressed into service, according to the newspaper: Experts in the field say there are other ways to rapidly boost the ventilator supply for overwhelmed hospitals. Most ventilators are sophisticated machines that keep critically ill people alive by delivering oxygen into the lungs through a tube inserted in the windpipe. Full-feature machines can cost as much as $50,000, but doctors say even basic models that cost less than $2,000 can sustain a patient in acute respiratory distress. The most grievously ill may need to remain on the machines for weeks until they can breathe on their own. There are tens of thousands of no-frills resuscitators used by paramedics and the military. Plastic surgeons and outpatient surgery centers also have ventilators in their offices. With elective procedures indefinitely on hold in much of the country, those machines are now sitting idle. The FDA’s emergency rule will reduce the ever-present risk of eventual lawsuits, freeing hospitals and doctors to experiment with the existing supply of machines and parts. For example, some hospitals are testing to see if ventilators can be used on two or more patients. Federal advisors project a need for up to 500,000 ventilators to save Americans from China's coronavirus.  That seems like a life & cost-saving option. U.S. manufacturers are trying to accelerate parts delivery. But there is no sign of federal $$ yet. https://t.co/yEtV9RW900 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 16, 2020 ","Feds OK Many Experiments with Ventilators, Breathing Gear for Coronavirus Victims",2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/26/feds-ok-many-experiments-with-ventilators-breathing-gear-for-coronavirus-victims/,Breitbart

"The coronavirus is reminding us that old wisdom retains its value in new times. For instance, there’s the issue of copper fixtures, such as cups and pipes, which were used by ancients across the world. As Fast Company’s Mark Wilson recently pointed out, copper has distinct anti-microbial properties—the metal does, after all, have that distinct taste to it. As one expert, Bill Keevil, professor of environmental health care at the University of Southampton, told the magazine, copper could and should be used much more: “We’ve seen viruses just blow apart. They land on copper and it just degrades them.” And in fact, in 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved the use of various anti-microbial metals and alloys, including copper, bronze, and brass. Still, in most places, copper was long ago replaced by stainless steel and plastic. These latter materials have many advantages, too, insofar as they are cheaper and don’t corrode, and yet maybe the old wisdom about the hygienic qualities of copper is more valuable than we’ve realized.  Now let’s consider some other examples of old wisdom proving its continuing worth; we’ll look at the enduring genius—much smarter than the latest politically correct fad—of borders, walls, distancing, dispersion, and self-defense.  Borders  For years, we’ve been told that open borders are a sign of modern, open-minded sophistication. And at the same time, we’ve been told that closed borders are a sign of reactionary, closed-minded thuggery—make that, Trumpery.  So what to make of this modern “sophistication” now, when virtually every country—even ultra-PC Canada—is closing its border, seeking to monitor, closely, who is coming in? Indeed, a March 22 article in The New York Times on the impact of the pandemic in Italy reads as if it were written by some hardcore right-winger. Having mocked the folly of various Italian politicians who had pledged not to change a thing—and certainly not to close the border—the Times article then adds this strong law-and-order flourish: If Italy’s experience shows anything, it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early, put in place with absolute clarity, then strictly enforced. And where does that leave “sanctuary cities,” where the rule is that all foreigners are good, with no questions asked about where they have been? Specifically, we should ask pointed questions of the Democrat presidential frontrunner, Joe Biden. Does he really mean it when he says “no deportations”? That even criminals with the coronavius will be safe from being expelled? And that the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy should be abolished? Will Biden and the national Democrats be willing to quarantine anyone if the American Civil Liberties Union objects? Such PC policies would defeat the whole purpose of having a border.  So if Biden were to win this year, he’d have to think long and hard about trying to follow through with such crazy-left policies, even if AOC insists on it. Sober Democrats might wish to brush up on the wisdom of the nation-state as a sovereign body, an idea that comes to us from such key figures as the 16th century Frenchman Jean Bodin, and the 17th century Englishman Thomas Hobbes.  Yes, if Democrats were to do some studying on the history of statecraft, they would see that those old-timers knew a thing or two. (And some Republicans, as well, would benefit from some classical learning.) Walls Walls are an obvious supplement to borders. That is, walls, and other kinds of fortifications, prove that you mean business about your border.  Cities, countries, and empires have been building walls for thousands of years—not because they wanted to, but because they had to. For instance, as pointed out by tweeter Wrath of Gnon, back in the 17th century, the city of Ferrara, Italy, insulated itself against the plague by the tough-minded expedient of not letting foreigners inside its walls without first being quarantined. (A more thoroughgoing take on Ferrara’s public-health success can be found in this medical journal.) Quarantines are always, in fact, a good idea in plague situations. And it’s from historical precedent, as well as practical necessity, that we get timeless wisdom—the question is whether or not we are willing to apply it. In our time, President Trump has been channeling that old wisdom, as he strives to build a wall across the U.S.-Mexican border. And yet even as the old wisdom still holds true, we keep finding more reasons why we need walls of various kinds.  For instance, in July 2016, we learned of a new terror-tactic requiring a new counter-terror response. That is, terrorists were using motor vehicles to run down pedestrians, and so passive defenses along walkways, such as bollards—which are a kind of wall—were called for. As this author wrote nearly four years ago,  We all intuitively understand the value of walls and fences; even ACLU members live in dwellings, not out in the open.  And throughout history, people—as nations and as individuals—have kept themselves contained.  Savages may live under the trees, but civilized people live behind walls.     Indeed, this author continued, if the situation was dangerous enough, then the home itself would have to be a castle—or a fortress:  Even individual houses, not just royal castles, were built as fortresses.   Outside of San Antonio, TX, is the fort-like Gallagher House, built in 1833, in conditions of near anarchy, for protection against constant Indian raids, plus the occasional Mexican marauder.  The Gallagher House is still there for tourist visits; of course it is, the walls are two feet thick, and so it’s not going anywhere.  To be sure, the nature of walls has changed; oftentimes, these days, it’s not so much a single wall as an echeloned series of walls, overseen, not only by brave men and women, but also by high-tech sensors and drones. Today, the coronavirus is inspiring the widespread use of new tools for wall-workers—including those brave health professionals staffing the public-health walls—such as the no-contact infrared thermometer. Such equipment is a vital part of the ongoing maintenance and modernization of those sturdy old walls.   Distancing  A new buzzphrase of the corona era is “social distancing,” which is pretty much self-explanatory—stay six feet apart.   We can quickly observe: If such distancing is a good idea, then maybe the dense-packed city is not a good idea.   Moreover, maybe loose-packed suburbs are a good idea. That was a point made by U.S. tech executive Farooq Butt in a March 14 tweet: Interesting to note that American suburbia, with its large empty spaces & single family homes, perpetually got slammed for encouraging “social isolation,” lack of walkability & a lack of community.  It’s precisely these qualities that make it a decent place to be in a pandemic. In other words, maybe it simply makes good sense to keep the population a bit separate, and not piled on top of each other. That’s the venerable logic, after all, of compartmentalizing ships—and to this day, it’s a tried-and-true principle of nautical engineering.   To the PC ear, the words “social distancing” sound, well, “xenophobic,” as if the stranger is being “othered,” as opposed to merely being properly identified.   Here, Breitbart News’s John Nolte was razor-sharp, as always, in dissecting the ostentatious virtue-signaling of “Virtuous American.” In Nolte’s telling, Virtuous American follows all the PC guidelines about recycling trash, reusing cups and straws, mass-transiting—and taking credit for every supposed good deed.  Yet Virtuous America thus puts himself, herself—or theyself—at risk. That is, everyone should have learned a long time ago that it’s best to dispose of germy trash, not reuse it.   Nolte then contrasts Virtuous American with “McMansion American,” the suburbanite driving his or her own car—thus not coughing or sneezing on anyone—boasting a basement big enough “to store enough food and water for four weeks.” In other words, suburban sprawl, and the distance it affords to people, isn’t so bad.  In fact, Nolte went even further, offering up another archetype, “Hick American,” who “lives anywhere from 50 feet to 50 acres from any potential Possibly Infected American.” Right about now, Hick American starts to look pretty smart.   So now we come to the step beyond distancing, namely, outright dispersion.  Dispersion  All through history, people have understood that cities, with their concentrations of people, can be unhealthy. That is, all the crowds, all the sewage, all the contagion—epidemiologically dangerous.   Of course, this danger was doubled in times of plague. And so those who could were wise to flee to the countryside. There, they could wait out the working out of Farr’s Law of Epidemics, which predicts the parabolic rise and fall of the infection-curve.  Interestingly, sometimes, these sojourns of isolation were spectacularly productive; for instance, in the late 17th century, Isaac Newton, fleeing the bubonic plague in London, used his time under an apple tree to figure out physics.  Indeed, the movements of people have often been associated with the restorative powers—real and imagined—of some rural place.  Much of the early settlement in Southern California, for instance, consisted of Yankees going west to the dry desert climate, seeking relief from tuberculosis. And Thomas Mann’s famous 1924 novel, The Magic Mountain, was set in a sanitarium in Davos, Switzerland; yes, the same place that became host, decades later, to a new kind of infestation—the World Economic Forum.  Moreover, the exodus to suburbia in the 20th century was in no small part an effort to find healthier living for the masses. Back in 1902, the Englishman Ebenezer Howard published The Garden City of To-Morrow, in which he called for more dispersed cities to help people get away from the dank, diseased, and polluted dangers of big cities. Howard’s work was enormously influential in the U.S., as well, inspiring officials to plan for highways and affordable mortgages so that ordinary Americans could enjoy a place in the suburban sun.  Of course, all through the 20th century, liberal elites mocked the suburban impulse, deeming it to be hopelessly middle-class and middle-brow; it was much better, we were told to live in big cities, near, say, the theater, the museums—and the toniest restaurant. And yet when the coronavirus hit, guess who was hurrying out of town? Hence this March 14 headline in the New York Times: “The Rich Have a Coronavirus Cure: Escape From New York: When fake rumors inspired a run on toilet paper, the 1 percent made a panicked exodus to their second homes.” As the article detailed: Outside a prewar co-op on lower Fifth Avenue on Friday morning, well-dressed people were loading cats and canvas bags into their hatchbacks. “The building is empty,’’ one woman entering with her dog explained. “Everyone’s gone to the Hamptons.” In the 20th century, the rise of aviation put a new premium on geographical dispersion. Germany, our enemy in two world wars, was eager to find ways to bomb its enemies, via dirigible, airplane, rocket—anything. The Germans had, after all, dropped bombs on England during World War One, and during World War Two, Hitler commissioned a prototype for an Amerikabomber.    In response to such threats, prudent American officials not only built up our air defenses, but also moved the country toward industrial dispersion—building new factories in the South and West, as far away as possible from German reach.  There’s a simple, yet timeless, point here: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.  Yet today we realize, to our horror, that we have put too much of our economic production—including for vital health wares—in a foreign basket, namely, China. That was a huge mistake, which Trump was struggling to fix even before the coronavirus.  Not surprisingly, the coronacrisis has accelerated the effort to diversify our national “portfolio.” That is, in a life-and-death crunch, we can’t be dependent on a country that’s halfway around the world—and that blames us, in warlike terms, for the virus that arose on their territory.  So it’s pleasing to report that the West is finally waking up to the dire threat of dependence on Big Panda. And while political figures such as Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio are demanding a “de-coupling” from China, others have already taken matters into their own hands.  For instance, in Italy, a hospital has figured out how to use a local 3-D printer to fabricate parts for life-saving machines that would otherwise have had to be imported.    In this bit of inspired do-it-yourself, we can see the vista of a new world, in which people can make their own parts and perhaps whole machines—and who knows what else they can make. Indeed, it’s possible to see an economic renaissance for “flyover country,” of the sort that this author has written about here at Breitbart News. More localized manufacturing, plus nationalized problem-solving, could be the key to Making Rural America Great Again. Moreover, as Rep. Matt Gaetz has shown, it could even be possible to turn the boondoggle Green New Deal into a job-rich Green Real Deal.   In the meantime, the coronavirus is going to force a substantial upgrading in the teleconferencing capacity of every organization and perhaps every individual. Right now, the many video-chat services are mostly seen as poor substitutes for human closeness and contact, and yet over time, that will change. That is, the nascent technologies of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality will provide new opportunities for rural folks who wish to be connected while staying on the farm, as well as new options for suburban folks, weary of long commutes. And in the meantime, new forms of online software collaboration will develop.  Self-Defense Anyone who has ever watched a zombie movie knows that in some stark worst-case scenario, basic civilizational order can break down.  So while we all hope nothing like that ever happens for real, we should regard the safety of ourselves, our loved ones, and our law-abiding neighbors as a top priority.     And such safety, of course, requires the means of safety: Hello, Second Amendment. As the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein liked to say, “An armed society is a polite society.” And if we have politeness, we certainly have law and order.   Many times in the past, this author has written in praise of the “Thin Blue Line” of cops and other law enforcers.  And more recently, he has written about the “Thin White Line” of health professionals, stoically facing the corona onslaught, as well as the more familiar health needs of 330 million Americans.   In the weeks and months to come, we are likely to be reminded, yet again, just how much we rely on these new centurions, guarding the ramparts of public order and health.   And yet, all too often, in the end, it’s up to the individual to provide for his or her own defense. That’s about as ancient a lesson as there is, going back to the time in the Book of Genesis, when Abel let his brother Cain get the jump on him.   So with the perpetual need for self-defense in mind—and with the possible chaos associated with corona as a refresher—it will be interesting to see what happens if the Democrats ever attempt to go Full Bloomberg on gun-grabbing. So while the coronavirus, in and of itself, is nothing but bad news, if we learn—or more precisely, if we re-learn—the old verities, we might just find that much good can yet emerge from this disaster.   And that, as Gandalf said in the first Lord of the Rings movie, is an encouraging thought.","Pinkerton: Coronavirus Will Bring a New Era of Borders, Walls, Distancing, Dispersion, and Self-Defense ",2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/26/pinkerton-coronavirus-will-bring-a-new-era-of-borders-walls-distancing-dispersion-and-self-defense/,Breitbart
"The doctor behind a U.K. college study on the impact of the coronavirus that predicted a doomsday scenario absent any prevention measures and prompted the U.S. government to take action against the deadly disease is now painting a more optimistic picture that is in line with President Donald Trump’s plan to open the American economy by Easter. While briefing the U.K.’s parliamentary select committee on science and technology on Wednesday, Dr. Neil Ferguson, the prominent epidemiologist who led the Imperial College study, suggested that the United Kingdom can now expect his low-end death rate predictions of 20,000 deaths to come to pass if they continue to follow his initial advice of implementing extreme prevention measures. Imperial College researchers who authored the study were able to make their initial predictions by entering coronavirus infection and death rates from China, South Korea, and Italy into epidemic modeling software and running simulations of what can happen in the U.K. and the United States. Dr. Ferguson indicated that prevention measures implemented by the government — such as social distancing and shutting down non-essential business — could make the lower end of his death projections for the United Kingdom and the U.S. a reality. In the study, the Imperial College team highlighted three possible scenarios — no action (510,000 deaths in the U.K., over two million in the U.S.); moderate action, dubbed the “mitigation strategy” (250,000 in the U.K., over one million in the U.S.); and an extreme response, named the “suppression strategy” (a few thousand in the U.S.; 20,000 in the U.K.).  In the study, Ferguson indicated that deaths could peak at 20,000 in the U.K. and a few thousand in the U.S. if the governments implement the suppression strategy.  Such a strategy involves social distancing of the entire population, combined with home isolation of cases and the quarantine of their family, as well as shutting down public gatherings and most workplaces in addition to school and university closures. The U.S. and the U.K. have instituted measures that at the very least echo the suppression strategy described by the Imperial College. To keep fatalities at their lowest in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the suppression strategy would have to be in place until a vaccine becomes available, which could take 12 to 18 months. However, the Imperial Team noted in the study: Such an intensive [suppression strategy] policy is predicted to result in a reduction in critical care requirements from a peak approximately 3 weeks after the interventions are introduced and a decline thereafter while the intervention policies remain in place. On Wednesday, Ferguson reportedly acknowledged that under the prevention measures in place in the U.K. now, it will only take the coronavirus “two to three weeks” to peak and dwindle. Imperial College researchers do warn that there could be seasonal waves of the disease, noting that it could subside, only to return later. The original epidemiology study prompted the Trump administration to escalate its efforts to combat the deadly and highly contagious disease. This week, President Trump has said he wants to open up the economy in about two weeks, by Easter Sunday on April 12, prompting criticism from the left. Trump’s goal, however, is consistent with Ferguson’s estimate for when the coronavirus cases will start going down. On Wednesday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, indicated that initial infection rate predictions suggesting the deadly and highly contagious disease would infect about half the U.S. population are overblown. She suggested that the action taken by the government, coupled with the response of the American people, will substantially reduce the infection rate. The Imperial College study predicted that absent any action to stem the spread of the disease, coronavirus would infect about 80 percent of the U.S. population. Dr. Ferguson did not revise his original predictions on Wednesday, as suggested by several media outlets. What the doctor said is that the U.K. is on its way to keep the death rate at the lower end of his projections, courtesy of the government response to the pandemic.",Imperial College Doctor: Prevention Measures Will Keep Death Rate Low,2020-03-26,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/imperial-college-doctor-prevention-measures-will-keep-death-rate-low/,Breitbart
"COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Police in southern Finland began Friday to enforce the new regulation aimed at ceasing all unnecessary human traffic to and from Uusimaa, the region that includes the Nordic nation’s capital, Helsinki. Police will block access and exit from the region, which has been hit worst in the country by the coronavirus. Social affairs minister Krista Kiuru said earlier this week that the decision was taken as the “risk of substantial spreading of the infection from the Uusimaa region to rest of Finland is high” through unnecessary travelling. Nationwide, Finland has so far confirmed 958 coronavirus cases — the vast majority of them in Uusimaa — and five deaths. The exceptional move that is set to end April 19, affects the daily lives of some 1.7 million people, nearly a third of Finland’s population.","Finland Sealing Off Infected Helsinki, Capital Region from Rest of Country",2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/27/finland-sealing-off-infected-helsinki-capital-region-from-rest-of-country/,Breitbart
"The chief executive of a body which represents hospital bosses has said that London facilities are facing a “continuous tsunami” of coronavirus patients, and that the city’s hospitals could be overwhelmed in “days”. Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers which speaks for those who run Britain’s hospitals, said that even though London hospitals have increased critical care capacity from between five- and sevenfold in just two weeks, they are still “struggling”. “They are struggling with two things: first is the explosion of demand they’re seeing in seriously ill patients. They’re saying it’s the number of patients that are arriving, the speed with which they are arriving, and how ill they are,” Mr Hopson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday. He continued that while “most of them are hanging on” his contacts in London’s hospitals “talk about wave, after wave, after wave. The word that is often used to me is a continuous ‘tsunami’. I think as one [hospital] CEO said to me yesterday, ‘This is much bigger and much larger numbers with a greater degree of stretch than you could ever possibly have imagined.'” The second issue is staff sickness, with some facilities seeing 50 per cent of medics struck down by coronavirus or self-isolating with symptoms. He added that even with thousands more ventilators said to be coming down the pipeline in the next couple of weeks, at present that lack of availability is a “real issue” in London hospitals. London Hospital Declares ‘Critical Incident’ over Coronavirus, Not Enough Spaces for Patients https://t.co/LjWElpsjZf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  On Wednesday, Mr Hobson had tweeted that the sharp increase in demand for coronavirus treatment in London was already “off the scale”, saying: “It’s evident that a number of hospitals are on a trajectory where their critical care capacity will become full within a few days. “CEOs report that the NHS London Regional team is working well, and hard, with them to agree the next steps to follow when this happens.” The government announced earlier this week that the ExCeL convention centre would be turned into a 4,000-bed coronavirus field hospital — NHS Hospital Nightingale — with the first 500 beds expected to be available by next week. The United Kingdom is currently two to three weeks behind Italy, meaning the worst of the effects of the pandemic are yet to come. Should London hospitals become overwhelmed, patients will likely be transferred and treated at the Nightingale site. Reports from Thursday claim that the Ministry of Defence, which is helping to coordinate the National Health Service response, is scoping out between five and 13 other sites across the country for field hospitals. While Mr Hopson paints a worrying picture of London, overall government officials have said that the NHS should be “within capacity” to cope with the worst, thanks to lockdown measures and plans to increase intensive care unit capacity. The government has also brought nearly 12,000 doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals out of recent retirement to the front lines, and 5,500 final-year student doctors and 18,700 final year nursing students have also been advanced to practical support. However, even with a greater number of healthcare professionals, the problem remains, as mentioned by Mr Hopson, of staff sickness. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said during the daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday that the government is trialling a test for coronavirus antibodies, which if successful could help determine if NHS staff in isolation can return to work. The tests may later be available for public use. The number of deaths in Britain from coronavirus have risen to 477, with the highest number — 414 — in England.

"560,000 Britons have volunteered to support the National Health Service (NHS) in taking care of the country’s vulnerable citizens during the coronavirus pandemic, more than double the initial government call for 250,000. On Tuesday, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock called for volunteers to perform simple but vital tasks for the 1.5 million Britons who will be forced to self-isolate for months. The request was exceeded by Wednesday evening when it was revealed that 405,000 had volunteered, with reports this morning that the number had breached the half-a-million mark. Run by the Royal Voluntary Service and coordinated through the Good SAM app, volunteers will pick up and deliver medicines and groceries to those quarantined, drive patients to medical appointments, and take time to call people to check on their wellbeing.

"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing: Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus. The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country’s Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened. The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country. “Other countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here,” said Dr. Hossein Hassanian, an adviser to Iran’s Health Ministry who gave the higher figures to the AP. “We have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. The pandemic has swept across the world, overwhelming hospitals, crippling economies and forcing governments to restrict the movements of billions of people. Particularly hard hit has been Iran, home to 80 million people. As of now, there is no known cure for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Scientists and doctors continue to study the virus and search for effective medicines and a vaccine. But in messages forwarded and forwarded again, Iranian social media accounts in Farsi falsely suggested a British school teacher and others cured themselves of the coronavirus with whiskey and honey, based on a tabloid story from early February. Mixed with messages about the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, some wrongly believed drinking high-proof alcohol would kill the virus in their bodies. The Islamic Republic has reported over 29,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country in the Middle East. International experts also fear Iran may be under-reporting its cases, as officials for days played down the virus ahead of a parliamentary election. In Iran, the government mandates that manufacturers of toxic methanol add an artificial color to their products so the public can tell it apart from ethanol, the kind of alcohol that can be used in cleaning wounds. Ethanol is also the kind of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, though its production is illegal in Iran. Some bootleggers in Iran use methanol, adding a splash of bleach to mask the added color before selling it as drinkable. Sometimes it is mixed with consumable alcohol to stretch supply, other times it comes as methanol, falsely advertised as drinkable, Hovda said. Methanol also can contaminate traditionally fermented alcohol. Methanol cannot be smelled or tasted in drinks. It causes delayed organ and brain damage. Symptoms include chest pain, nausea, hyperventilation, blindness and even coma. Hassanian said his figures included reports from coroner’s offices around Iran also counting those who died outside of hospitals from the poisonings. “Unfortunately in some provinces, including Khuzestan and Fars, deaths from drinking methanol has exceeded the number of deaths from the new coronavirus,” he said. Dr. Knut Erik Hovda, a clinical toxicologist in Oslo, said to expect more methanol poisoning victims. “The virus is spreading and people are just dying off, and I think they are even less aware of the fact that there are other dangers around,” Hovda said. “When they keep drinking this, there’s going to be more people poisoned.” Even before the outbreak, methanol poisoning had taken a toll in Iran. One academic study found methanol poisoning sickened 768 people in Iran between September and October 2018 alone, killing 76. Other Muslim nations that ban their citizens from drinking also see such methanol poisoning, although Iran appears to be the only one in the pandemic so far to turn toward it as a fake cure. In Buddhist Cambodia, police said they seized 4,200 liters (1,100 gallons) of methanol from a man who unwittingly planned to make toxic hand sanitizer because of the virus outbreak. Muslim drinkers in Iran can be punished with cash fines and 80 lashes. However, minority Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians can drink alcoholic beverages in private. While police occasionally announce alcohol busts, the trade in nontoxic alcohol also continues. Locally made Iranian arak from fermented raisins, known as Aragh sagi, sells for $10 for a 1.5-liter bottle. Imported vodka sells for $40 a bottle. “Every year during Nowruz, or the Persian New Year holidays that begin March 21, my customers double,” said Rafik, an Iranian-Armenian who makes vodka in the basement of his Tehran home. He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used for fear of arrest. “This year, because of corona, it jumped up by four- or five-fold.” Farhad, a self-described heavy drinker who lives in central Tehran, said alcohol remains easy to find for those looking for it. “Even you can find it offered when you are walking down the street, “ he said. Since 1979, Iran’s 40 alcohol factories have seen their production changed to pharmaceutical needs and sanitizers. Others had been left idle, like the abandoned Shams alcohol factory east of Tehran. But now, in a time when even some mosques in Iran hand out high-proof alcohol as a sanitizer, officials plan to start work again at Shams to produce 22,000 liters of 99% alcohol a day.",Hundreds Die in Iran After Drinking Poison ‘Cure’ for Coronavirus,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/27/hundreds-die-in-iran-after-drinking-poison-cure-for-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"It took coronavirus to provoke Los Angeles to move homeless people off the streets. But what the city is doing could make the pandemic worse. Last week, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced an emergency plan to “add 1,600 emergency shelter beds in thirteen City recreation centers” within a week, and to scale up to 6,000 beds “in the coming days.” The idea, he said, was to stop the spread of coronavirus by moving the homeless indoors. Some advocates for the homeless were enthusiastic. “It’s a good thing,” Rev. Andy Bales, CEO of the Union Rescue Mission downtown, told me. “And I wish it would’ve all happened sooner, before this pandemic.” He says that homeless people have fewer risk factors for coronavirus, such as overseas travel. And if they are sick, it is more humane to bring them in. “Leaving them outside would be a brutal way to let somebody suffer and die,” he said. It is hard to disagree with that. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises caution. The agency’s guidelines say moving the homeless indoors may not be the best idea if it congregates them together. The CDC specifically advises against moving people from encampments, unless “individual housing units are available.” With New York announcing this week that 30 homeless people had tested positive for coronavirus in city shelters, moving L.A.’s homeless into common indoor spaces, shared by hundreds of other people, seems risky. In fact, California is letting convicts out of prison because of fear that living in close quarters could make them more vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus. But L.A. is doing the opposite when it comes to the homeless. Some homeless people in L.A. are glad to have the shelter, and ready access to soap and water.  But others told the Los Angeles Times they feared the recreation centers will become “hotbeds” of infection, and preferred their own “social distancing” outside. San Francisco’s approach has been to move people out of existing shelters, to create more space inside, and to provide emergency shelters elsewhere. Beyond that, city officials are only bringing in the most vulnerable people — the elderly, for example — while giving “sanitizing equipment and advice on social distancing to those left outside.” The Federal officials told the San Francisco Chronicle “that they’re finding it’s safer to leave homeless camps outside in the open air, with proper spacing and sanitation facilities, than to move people into cramped settings indoors.” The Chronicle adds that the Trump administration has praised San Francisco’s approach. So why is L.A. doing the opposite? At a recreation center in Westwood this week, Breitbart News spoke to homeless men waiting to enter, as well as staff outside. A shuttle bus marked “SHELTER” circulated in the area, picking up anyone who wanted to come in, after asking them “screening” questions and taking their temperatures. There seemed to be no attempt to prioritize the most vulnerable: the goal was simply to move people off the streets. One man told Breitbart News that he had been moved from the nearby shelter at the Armory — but that was because the National Guard needed the space, not because the city was creating more “social distancing” among residents. Reports indicate that beds inside the recreation centers will be six feet apart — but the residents will move about. Can they be spaced six feet apart at all times? Moreover, the Los Angeles Police Department has told residents that men and women will not be separated, nor will children and adults. The setup seems inherently unsafe for women and children. It is no stretch to say that a single infection — missed by screening — could spread widely within that environment. In New York, one infected homeless man was sent to a shelter from the hospital because he was not sick enough. Moreover, there are concerns among some communities that infection could spread from the recreation centers. Two police are posted at each recreation center — but they are there simply to observe, not to confine those inside. The Westwood recreation center is in an industrial area. Not so a center in Cheviot Hills, which is in a park, near sports fields and playgrounds. Breitbart News observed children playing near the entrance there earlier this week. Other centers that are reportedly under consideration include a recreation center in Pacific Palisades, which is next to a playground and near the commercial center of the community, including grocery stores and pharmacies. City workers are also at risk. Mayor Garcetti announced that he had activated the Disaster Service Worker program, which will place some City employees in temporary roles” at the recreation centers-turned-homeless shelters. The Disaster Service Worker program considers city employees “impressed” — a term from the late eighteenth century, when American sailors were forced into the British navy. Breitbart News observed several city workers loading supplies into the Cheviot Hills recreation center this week. They wore masks, but seemed nervous. Two exchanged a hug — against “social distancing” recommendations. There also seems to be no plan or timeline for moving the homeless out of the recreation centers when the crisis abates. Residents are concerned that the heavily used recreation centers — a crucial outlet — could be lost to them. Dr. Drew Pinsky, who has been raising the alarm about homelessness in L.A. as a public health hazard for months, was optimistic. He shared Rev. Bales’s enthusiasm that something was finally being done — and that California Gov. Gavin Newsom was talking about mental health problems among the homeless. But he acknowledged to Breitbart News that Garcetti’s current plan seemed to have serious flaws: “This could go very bad, don’t get me wrong.” Pinsky hastened to add: “They’re staying nimble … and they’re not letting ideology blind them.” He hopes for a massive, “FEMA-style operation with tents.” Many residents would prefer that — for their sake, and for the homeless. Homelessness is not just a human tragedy and a public health risk. It is a political problem for Garcetti, and arguably prevented him from running for president in 2020. The crisis provides him an opportunity to do something. Do “something,” yes. But please try something better than this. Joel B.

"President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the global coronavirus pandemic. “Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China,” Trump wrote on Twitter after the call. “Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet.” The president expressed some solidarity with China while fighting the coronavirus, despite questions about their transparency about the virus. “China has been through much and has developed a strong understanding of the Virus,” he wrote. “We are working closely together. Much respect!” Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2020  Earlier Thursday, the president questioned whether China’s number of coronavirus case was accurate, as the United States surpassed their number. “You don’t know what the numbers are in China,” Trump said to reporters during a White House press briefing, and added, “I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that’s a little hard.” The president also defended his use of the phrase “Chinese virus” but acknowledged that he did not need to use the phrase as often if it offended China. “I talk about the Chinese virus, and I mean it, that’s where it came from … this was a Chinese virus,” he said. “But I don’t have to say it if they feel so strongly about it. We’ll see.”  ",Donald Trump Discusses Defeating Coronavirus with China’s President Xi Jinping,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/donald-trump-discusses-defeating-coronavirus-with-chinas-president-xi-jinping/,Breitbart

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex — also known as Prince Harry and his Hollywood wife Meghan – have left Canada behind and moved permanently to California, UK media reports said Friday. The Royal couple flew by private jet from Canada to Los Angeles last week before the border between the two countries closed because of the deadly Chinese coronavirus outbreak, the Sun newspaper reported from London. The transfer is part of the “transitioning” process from all Royal duties to a “progressive new role” in 2020 the two outlined in January. Living in Los Angeles also moves them closer to living a “modest life of seclusion and privacy away from the media spotlight” they have previously announced was vital to their future. It is thought Prince Harry is now keen to pursue his environmental mentor role while wife Meghan has never concealed her desire to restart her acting career.

They had to get out.” The border between the U.S. and Canada — the longest in the world — closed last week in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, as both countries see the numbers of those infected rise.

They realised Canada would not work out for various reasons and they want to be based in the Los Angeles area. “They have a big support network there. It’s where their new team of Hollywood agents and PRs and business managers are based.” Meghan grew up in the Californian city and her mother, Doria Ragland, still lives there. The one-time actress also has a network of friends and work contacts in Los Angeles, where she could now restart her career.

"Following a Friday interview with New Orleans Saints star quarterback Drew Brees, NBC “Today” anchor Hoda Kotb was overcome with emotion after discussing the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the place she once called home. Brees this week donated $5 million to help combat the spread in Louisiana, which has been severely hit by the coronavirus, and in the interview, he offered some hope to viewers. “This is a devastating thing for a lot of people but especially for the state of Louisiana,” Brees told Kotb, later adding, “[W]e have to come together and help one another and make sure we get through this together.” The quarterback then told the people of New Orleans to “hang in there and maintain hope.” Kotb concluded the interview thanking Brees for his generous donation, and then broke down in tears. “I’m sorry,” she said, trying to gain her composure. “Hoda, I know it’s a lot,” NBC’s Savannah Guthrie stated. “Hoda, I’m so sorry, hon.

"Delaware Governor John Carney (D) changed his statewide shutdown order Thursday, recognizing gun stores as “essential” and allowing them to remain open. WBOC reports that Carney’s original order, released Sunday, had gun stores listed as “non-essential,” and therefore under instruction to remain closed until May 15. Some gun stores throughout the state defied Carney, remaining open Monday thru Thursday of this week. As a result, three gun stores in New Castle alone had been served with “cease and desist letters and closed down.” Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association’s Jeff Hague reacted to the determination of gun store owners, saying, “If people believe that you have the right to keep and bear arms, if you closed all the gun stores and not allow anybody to purchase a firearm you’re infringing on that constitutional right.” On Thursday the Governor’s shutdown order was changed to allow gun stores to remain open with certain restrictions: Firearms dealers may conduct sales of firearms, ammunition, and other goods directly related to responsible firearm storage and maintenance, by appointment only. No more than two appointments per half hour shall occur, and sellers are limited to operating during normal working hours they operated on prior to the State of Emergency. Any seller who violates such directive may be subject to criminal prosecution or other civil enforcement remedies up to and including arrest or the involuntary closure of the business. The Second Amendment Foundation’s Alan Gottlieb reacted to the Governor’s changes, saying, “We’re delighted that cooler heads have prevailed in Delaware. A considerable amount of hard work went into this, and to be honest, we’d rather not have to file lawsuits against anybody under the present circumstances.” Gottlieb added, “We can think of no more essential endeavor outside of health care and emergency services during a time of crisis than a business that enables citizens to exercise their fundamental right protected by the Second Amendment.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Georgia State Rep. Matt Gurtler (R) is asking his Governor Brian Kemp (R) to suspend the handgun carry permit requirement during a state of emergency so Georgians can freely carry open or concealed during days of unrest.

Jen Jordan (D), who said, “The fact that we’ve seen a spike in sales of guns and ammunition underscores just how wrong Gurtler is.” Jordan did not explain how gun sales disprove the push to allow Georgians to carry guns during an emergency. The Second Amendment Daily reports that the process for getting a carry permit in Georgia includes visiting your local sheriff’s office.

"China’s government-run Global Times concluded on Friday that President Donald Trump’s description of a conversation with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping as “very good” proved that the American healthcare system needed “urgent” Chinese aid. Trump spoke to Xi on the phone late Thursday about the growing Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which experts agree began in Wuhan, central China, in November. Xi Jinping’s pressure on his Communist Party to silence any medical information about the virus for most of December and January, allowing the virus to spread unimpeded, is believed to have directly led to the virus spreading worldwide, killing tens of thousands of people. One study found that as many as 95 percent of the world’s cases could have been avoided if Beijing, rather than arresting doctors sharing safety tips online in the early days of the outbreak, simply heeded their professional advice. Reports published throughout the outbreak as recently as Friday morning suggest that China is still lying about the true death toll in Wuhan, claiming the outbreak there to be over while locals with coronavirus symptoms get turned away at local hospitals to keep the official coronavirus tally low. Despite this, President Trump said following his call with the dictator that China, meaning its ruling Communist Party, “has developed a strong understanding of the Virus” and claimed that he and Xi “are working closely together.” Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2020  Xi’s diplomats have claimed, without evidence, that the U.S. Army created the virus and unleashed it on China as a biological attack. China’s communist-run Xinhua news agency, Xi used the call to demand that Trump “take substantive action to improve bilateral relations” and “develop a relationship of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.” Xi reportedly demanded that Trump expand American economic ties to China – where the overwhelming majority of most goods in the American market are already made – in the name of “the safety of global supply chains.” While Trump said that China had developed “understanding” of the virus it ignored for months and deemed the call with Xi “very good,” state media’s government of Xi’s conversation indicated only that Xi said that Trump was “carrying out a series of policies” and Xi “noticed” them, without qualifying the policies as good or bad. “The health departments and medical experts of the two countries have maintained communication over the global pandemic situation and bilateral anti-epidemic cooperation, Xi said, adding that China is willing to continue sharing, without reservation, relevant information and experience with the United States,” Xinhua reported. The Global Times concluded that Trump’s “shifting attitude” suggested that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States was in such a dire state that only help from the Communist Party could improve the situation. “The shifting attitude of the US reflected that seeking help from Beijing is an urgent task for Washington given the pandemic continued worsening in the US,” the state propaganda outlet said, citing Communist Party-approved “experts.” “The gravity of the situation in the country has forced Trump to express willingness of asking for help from China, not to mention that the US needs to buy a huge amount of medical equipment including personal protective equipment, test kits and equipment like ventilators,” an alleged Chinese professor is quoted in the piece as saying. “This is an objective that Trump needs to achieve [through the phone call].” The Global Times repeatedly praised Xi for taking the call despite alleged American belligerence against China, which it defined as support for Taiwan, the nation with the world’s most successful response to the coronavirus outbreak; accurately noting that Wuhan is the origin city of the pandemic; and noting, citing many expert observations, that the Communist Party’s censorship of information on the virus is almost exclusively responsible for the pandemic. The Global Times published a separate article Friday insulting Trump for allegedly having “failed to appropriately deal with the outbreak,” a conclusion it has asserted on a nearly daily basis. Two weeks ago, the Global Times declared the Chinese coronavirus outbreak Trump’s “Chernobyl,” a reference to the most catastrophic failure in the history of communism. “US politicians under the leadership of President Donald Trump have been downplaying the threat posed by the virus since when there was a sign of the outbreak in the country,” the Times claimed. “And until today in the face of the rapidly increasing numbers of confirmed infections, these politicians are still engaged in politicizing the virus rather than epidemic prevention.” “US politicians have been telling lies. Fortunately, many Americans can still keep a clear head and see through the filthy political tricks,” the propaganda outlet asserted. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, claimed that Xi insisted to Trump that “China shared information on the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], including the genetic sequence of the virus, at the earliest time possible,” an allegation long ago proven to be false. “We will continue to do so and work together with the international community to overcome the pandemic,” Xi reportedly said. China’s emphasis on “cooperation” comes alongside a new push by Xi to establish a “Health Silk Road,” a healthcare equivalent to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the dictator’s plan to use predatory lending to colonize transportation infrastructure around the world. Xi has already gotten the government of Italy – crippled significantly by the coronavirus pandemic due to its strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party – to agree to allow Chinese doctors to enter the Italian government-run healthcare system, ostensibly because Italy needs more medical professionals to keep up with the overwhelming number of coronavirus patients in its hospitals. China is also peddling its supplies and doctors to nations like Serbia and Spain. The latter country received a large shipment this week of coronavirus testing kits from China, all of which were faulty; China refused to take responsibility and claimed Madrid had incorrectly purchased them from an “unlicensed” company. There is no such thing as private business in China; all companies are owned and run by members of the Communist Party. The “Health Silk Road” is proving profitable for China, according to a report by the Hong Kong broadcast network RTHK. In January and February, nearly 9,000 “new manufacturers” opened to make medical masks to feed the national and global demand for medical supplies. “As cases in the country have dwindled, the 34-year-old – who was previously in pharmaceuticals – is now profiting from new markets and exporting masks to Italy, where the death toll has overtaken that of the mainland [China],” RTHK noted, citing the owner of one of the 8,950 factories. A report published this month showed that many of China’s factories nationwide are now relying on Uyghur Muslim slave labor for manufacturing. At least 83 global companies – including Apple, Gap, Nintendo, and BMW – use labor from factories that exploit Uyghur slaves. The use of Uyghur slaves nationwide is a new development, as the Communist Party had typically relegated them to the sprawling concentration camps of western Xinjiang, where they are indigenous to.

"The British coronavirus death toll has risen to 578, seeing its biggest daily increase with 115 coronavirus fatalities in 24 hours — and an explosion of cases in Gwent, Wales. All told there were 11,658 confirmed cases in the United Kingdom as of Thursday. The United Kingdom is thought to be approximately two weeks behind Italy in the severity of its coronavirus outbreak — but the health chief in Wales is worried that one region in the country is following “the same pattern as Italy”. Gwent in south Wales has seen 309 confirmed cases of the Chinese virus — almost half of the total 628 infections in the British home nation — which has made the Welsh county the second worst-affected region after London, taking over from the West Midlands in England, according to The Times. Dr Sarah Aitken, who is the director of public health at the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board district, said: “In Gwent, we are seeing a rapidly rising increase in the number of cases of coronavirus in the community, the number of people being admitted to hospital and the number of people dying of the virus. “The pattern we are seeing in Gwent is the same pattern seen in Italy, where their healthcare system is now overwhelmed.

The number of fatalities has been roughly doubling every two days, and there are signs that the rate may be slowing down and moving closer towards every three days, according to government experts. 98 per cent of total fatalities are said to have had underlying health conditions. Dr Harries said in comments reported by The Sun: “What we will be looking for is a change in the slope rather than a very steep curve upwards, we will be looking for it to be a gentler slope. “But we must not take our foot off the pedal. People have been really co-operating and in the last few days — the public have really understood that this is something very serious and their actions, wherever they are, will save lives. “So, too early to say yet but starting to move in the right direction.” Coronavirus: 712 People Die in Italy in 24 Hours, Total Death Toll Exceeds 8,000 https://t.co/cA6s1w8lYP — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 27, 2020 ","Coronavirus Explosion In Welsh Region Resembles Italy ‘Pattern’, UK Daily Deaths Break 100",2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/27/uk-daily-death-toll-tops-100-welsh-region-following-same-pattern-italy/,Breitbart
"A Michigan emergency room nurse on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic issued a dire warning and chilling update on the reality of the virus and the strain it is having on hospitals, begging people to stay home and warning that “it’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy.” Mary MacDonald, who works for the Ascension Health System, posted a viral update on Instagram this week, detailing her experience after working at the Southfield location to assist with an influx of patients. “I’ll have to admit, in being totally transparent, if you had asked me ten-plus days ago if I thought this was going to get as bad as it was, I would have told you no,” she said in the video:     Dear Family, Friends and Complete Strangers,  Please STAY HOME!! Love, an ER Nurse A post shared by  Mary Macdonald (@marymac019) on Mar 23, 2020 at 7:32pm PDT “I mean, you heard the rumors. You saw the trends. But until you see if first hand, you just have no idea what it’s like — what’s it’s going to be like. And it’s truly frightening,” she continued, explaining that they are now seeing double — even triple — the number of patients coming in, many of whom are not getting tested. Coming into the hospital, she said, does not serve to benefit a person unless he or she is experiencing “respiratory distress,” and even then, the hospitals are quickly running low on vital supplies to treat those patients — from ventilators to Tylenol. “Resources are very slim. We have no medications to keep these patients even ventilated, let alone ventilators,” she said. “Medications like fentanyl or propofol that would keep a patient sedated while they’re intubated we’re out of. … We’re out of Tylenol.” “It’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy. We intubated, from 10:00 p.m. last night to this morning, we intubated two of my patients within a half hour. And upwards of ten patients were put on ventilators. My patient took the last ventilator available in the hospital,” she said, further detailing the chilling new reality. “And that’s not even going back to the fact that we don’t have any ventilators to put these patients on, so we’re going to start making life or death decisions in regards to people’s care,” she said. “So you’re going to come in and you’re going to get tagged whether you deem necessary to even get intubated, or are you being sent home to die,” she added: Normally, if a patient was to pass away, it would be because we tried everything that we could, we did everything that we could, we had all the resources and all the people that we needed to help save this patient’s life, and it was just their time. And now, we aren’t giving the patient the time to choose whether it’s their time or not. We’re choosing for them. “This is truly scary, and nobody is taking it seriously,” she continued, noting the pictures on social media of spring breakers partying on beaches and others not practicing proper social distancing. Hospitals are also running out of gloves, and medical professionals are forced to reuse masks “because we are completely out of resources,” MacDonald continued. “There are no masks. There are no gowns. They’re running low on gloves because everyone has panicked and stockpiled this so that medical staff doesn’t have it,” she said, showing the camera the brown paper bag she uses to transport her mask to and from work. “We cannot stay safe, and we cannot care for all of these people that are coming in because no one is taking this seriously. And I am being super transparent. I was one of those people that wasn’t taking it seriously,” she said. “But I’m here to tell you that you need to. We are literally making life and death decisions for people,” MacDonald added, begging people to heed her advice and stay home. “Stay home with your loved ones. Don’t go out. Don’t go to the grocery store. Don’t go through the drive-thrus. Don’t do anything that could put you at risk to have to see me at the end of the tunnel,” she said. “I’m telling you it’s not worth it. And I don’t know what I can do to save people anymore, and that is something I’ve never wanted to say in my entire career.” Her warning comes as Michigan emerges as one of the United States’ latest coronavirus hotspots, with nearly 3,000 confirmed cases and 60 related deaths, including a Detroit mother of four. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) has issued stringent stay-at-home orders, which prohibit “all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring among persons outside a single household.”",Michigan ER Nurse: ‘It’s Going to Be Just like Italy’,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/27/michigan-er-nurse-going-be-italy/,Breitbart
"Friday on WWJ News Radio, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) said vendors were being told not to send medical equipment to Michigan for the coronavirus pandemic after President Donald Trump attacked her on Fox News. Thursday night on Fox News, Trump said, “We’ve had a big problem with the young — a woman governor. You know who I’m talking about — from Michigan. We don’t like to see the complaints.” He added, “She doesn’t get it done, and we send her a lot. Now, she wants a declaration of emergency, and, you know, we’ll have to make a decision on that. But Michigan is a very important state. I love the people of Michigan.” When asked about Trump’s comments, Whitmer said, “I think it’s very distressing. You know I observed early on like a lot of governors on both sides of the aisle that the federal preparation was concerning. That apparently struck a nerve, and I’ve been uniquely singled out despite my voice not being the only one that observed that. I have never — I don’t go into personal attacks I don’t have time for that. I don’t have energy for that frankly. All of our focus has to be on COVID-19 right here right now.” When asked about getting needed supplies, Whitmer said, “That is all I’ve been striving for this whole time. We need assistance. When the federal government told us that we needed to go it ourself, we started procuring every item we get our hands-on. But what I’ve gotten back is that vendors with whom we’ve procured contracts are now being told not to send stuff here to Michigan. It’s really concerning. I reached out to the White House last night and asked for a phone call with the president. Ironically at the same time that all the other stuff going on.

"A draft letter by one of southeast Michigan’s major hospital systems was leaked online Thursday revealing the hospital’s policy to prioritize care for “patients who have the best chance of getting better” in the event of a shortage due to the coronavirus pandemic. The letter was drafted by officials at the Henry Ford Health System and is addressed to “our patients, families and community.” It outlines the criteria for which patients will be eligible for care if the hospital reaches capacity and is forced to ration limited resources. “Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care.” The letter explains the policy in the event of a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators: “If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition.” Some of the conditions that may make a person ineligible are listed as “severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; Terminal cancers; Severe trauma or burns.” A statement issued Thursday night by Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of Henry Ford Health System, confirmed the authenticity of the draft letter, but stressed that it reflects a “worst case scenario.” “With a pandemic of this nature, health systems must be prepared for a worst case scenario,” Munkarah said. “Gathering the collective wisdom from across our industry, we carefully crafted our policy to provide critical guidance to healthcare workers for making difficult patient care decisions during an unprecedented emergency.” He added, “These guidelines are deeply patient focused, intended to be honoring to patients and families. We shared our policy with our colleagues across Michigan to help others develop similar, compassionate approaches. It is our hope we never have to apply them and we will always do everything we can to care for our patients, utilizing every resource we have to make that happen.” As your trusted healthcare provider, our duty is to be prepared for worst case scenarios. Yesterday you may have seen an internal policy that has been circulated but not yet implemented. Here is our response: pic.twitter.com/W1orpUUJ5t — Henry Ford News (@HenryFordNews) March 27, 2020  The draft letter was leaked online Thursday when Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, tweeted out an image of the letter on what appeared to be official hospital letterhead. The full contents of the letter was printed by the Detroit Free Press (emphasis in original): To our patients, families and community: Please know that we care deeply about you and your family’s health and are doing our best to protect and serve you and our community. We currently have a public health emergency that is making our supply of some medical resources hard to find. Because of shortages, we will need to be careful with resources. Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care. What this means for you and your family: 1. Alert staff during triage of any current medical conditions or if you have a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) or other important medical information. 2. If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition. 3. Some patients will be extremely sick and very unlikely to survive their illness even with critical treatment. Treating these patients would take away resources for patients who might survive. 4. Patients who are not eligible for ICU or ventilator care will receive treatment for pain control and comfort measures. Some conditions that are likely to may [sic] make you not eligible include: 5. Patients who have ventilator or ICU care withdrawn will receive pain control and comfort measures. 6. Patients who are treated with a ventilator or ICU care may have these treatments stopped if they do not improve over time. If they do not improve this means that the patient has a poor chance of surviving the illness — even if the care was continued. This decision will be based on medical condition and likelihood of getting better. It will not be based on other reasons such as race, gender, health insurance status, ability to pay for care, sexual orientation, employment status or immigration status. All patients are evaluated for survival using the same measures. 7. If the treatment team has determined that you or your family members does not meet criteria to receive critical care or that ICU treatments will be stopped, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can ask for a review by a team of medical experts (a Clinical Review Committee evaluation.) Michigan has become an emerging hot spot of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The state’s top health official, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, said hospitals in southeast Michigan are “at or near capacity.” The Henry Ford Health System is one of the major hospital providers in the Metro Detroit area, along with the William Beaumont Health System. Both providers have said they were caring for more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients at their 13 hospitals. Due to the sudden surge, operating rooms were being converted into intensive care units, and clinics had been turned into rooms for patients needing other medical care. On Wednesday, Beaumont Health said its hospitals were swamped with 650 patients who had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and more than 200 with tests pending. It said it would transfer more people to its hospital in Wayne and get help from other health care providers. “The number of patients coming to our emergency rooms continues to grow rapidly,” Beaumont CEO John Fox said. Fox told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday that the pandemic is proving to be health care providers’ “worst nightmare,” noting that Beaumont is admitting 100 new coronavirus patients per day, at that time. “What we all need to remember is that we got our first patient two weeks ago. So this is coming on hard and fast. This is definitely a biological tsunami,” he said. “In my lifetime, we’ve never had a pandemic like this,” Fox said. “Across our system, we are facing limitations and nearing capacity with our staffing, personal protective equipment and mechanical ventilators,” said Beaumont’s chief operating officer Carolyn Wilson. “The numbers are changing and increasing even in two-hour intervals,” said Bob Riney, the chief operating officer at Henry Ford, whose flagship hospital is in the city of Detroit. Dr. Betty Chu, the chief clinical officer and chief quality officer at Henry Ford, predicted an “upcoming surge.” Chu noted that the hospital was already reallocating resources because the Henry Ford hospitals in West Bloomfield and Detroit have reached capacity due to COVID-19 patients. “Today our capacity is quite full at those two hospitals — West Bloomfield and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit,” Chu said Wednesday. “We fortunately have the luxury right now of having additional capacity at some of our other campuses.” On Wednesday, Mary Macdonald, an Oakland County ER nurse, posted a viral video on Instagram detailing the harrowing conditions at southeast Michigan hospitals seeing this surge in coronavirus patients while combating shortages of supplies and equipment. “It’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy,” Macdonald said. “From 10:00 PM last night to this morning, we intubated two of my patients within a half-hour. And upwards of 10 patients were put on ventilators. My patient took the last ventilator available in the hospital,” she said. “Normally, if a patient was to pass away, it would be because we tried everything that we could, we did everything that we could, we had all the resources and all the people that we needed to help save this patient’s life, and it was just their time. And now we aren’t giving the patient the time to choose whether it’s their time or not. We’re choosing for them,” she said. Macdonald also noted that the hospital is short of even basic supplies. “Resources are very slim. We have no medications to keep these patients even ventilated, let alone ventilators,” she said, adding that they are out medications like propofol to keep people sedated when they are intubated. She said they are even running out of Tylenol. “There are no masks. There are no gowns. They’re running low on gloves because everyone has panicked and stockpiled this so that medical staff doesn’t have it,” she said and then showed the used N95 mask she was required to stow in a brown paper bag after work every day. Macdonald urged her fellow Michiganders to take the social distancing instructions seriously in order to protect themselves and their neighbors from spreading the virus, otherwise the overwhelmed hospital system won’t be able to care for all the sick. “We don’t have any ventilators to put these patients on,” Macdonald stressed. “So, we’re going to start making life or death decisions in regards to people’s care. So you’re going to come in and you’re going to get tagged whether you [are] deem[ed] necessary to even get intubated or are you being sent home to die. This is truly scary, and nobody is taking it seriously.”     Dear Family, Friends and Complete Strangers,  Please STAY HOME!! Love, an ER Nurse A post shared by  Mary Macdonald (@marymac019) on Mar 23, 2020 at 7:32pm PDT Khaldun, the chief medical office for Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services, said the state is “probably a few weeks out” from hitting a peak in coronavirus cases. Michigan reported nearly 2,900 cases by Thursday and 60 deaths, both an increase of Wednesday’s statewide numbers. Wayne County, home to Detroit, accounted for nearly half of the cases. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, called Wayne a “hot spot” nationally and said she was concerned the county was “having a more rapid increase.” Southeast Michigan, like New York City, is a hub for international travel. As the capital of the world’s auto industry, Metro Detroit has daily direct flights to and from the Motor City to various major cities in Europe and Asia. Detroit is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite its dramatic economic rebound in recent years after its municipal bankruptcy in 2013, the city is still one of the poorest cities in the nation, with a poverty rate three times higher than the national average, and the city’s population suffers in greater numbers from underlining conditions like diabetes and heart disease. “Part of what we’re seeing in Detroit is that there’s such a high number of individuals who have those underlying conditions, who have diabetes and the heart disease, who may have obesity,” Khaldun explained. On Tuesday, Marlowe Stoudamire, 43, one of the young entrepreneurs involved in rebuilding the city, died from complications from COVID-19. According to health officials at Henry Ford Health System, Stoudamire had “no known underlying health conditions or recent travel.” The City of Detroit’s police force has also been hit by the coronavirus pandemic, as 331 Detroit officers and 70 civilian police employees have been quarantined since the outbreak, and two members of the force have died this week due to COVID-19.

"Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Dominic Raab is the “designated survivor” if Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who been infected by the coronavirus, is incapacitated. Raab, who also serves as First Secretary of State in Boris Johnson’s administration, is known to have tested negative for coronavirus on two previous occasions. Prime Minister Johnson is confirmed as having been infected with the disease, although he says he only has “mild symptoms of the coronavirus, that’s to say a temperature and a persistent cough”, and for now he intends to continue, “thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team [and] lead the national fightback against coronavirus” from isolation. Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, is also confirmed to have been infected, and the Chief Medical Officer is self-isolating with symptoms.   BREAKING: Boris Johnson Tests Positive for Coronavirus, Self-Isolating https://t.co/f5dJEfrvc2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 27, 2020  The fact that the “designated survivor” role went to Raab, a former Brexit Secretary and noted Leave supporter, is believed to have caused some disquiet in the Cabinet, with allies of Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who was Johnson’s key partner on the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum, believing he should have been given the job. “If Boris can’t do his job because he is incapacitated, a lot of people think that Michael [Gove] should be running the show, not Raab,” one minister told The Times in comments reported on March 22nd. “One of these people is Michael, of course,” the minister added dryly. A second source suggested that ministers were “wrestling like cats in a sack”, with Gove clashing with Hancock, in particular, over which of them should be chief co-ordinator of the coronavirus response. Besides Raab’s designation as stand-in for the Prime Minister, people have also been designated to fill in for Dominic Cummings, Chief Adviser to the Prime Minister, and Lee Cain, Director of Communications for 10 Downing Street.

"The population of Baltimore, Maryland, has dropped below 600,000 residents, according to U.S. Census estimates published Thursday. In a statement, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young (D) said the estimates “are extremely important and help underscore the critical need to get the 2020 Census count as complete and accurate as possible.” However, Young did not comment on the reasons for the decline in numbers, but said he was focused on getting a complete count for the upcoming census so the city would receive its “fair share” of federal funding. “I have made boosting Baltimore’s completion rate for the 2020 Census a top priority for my administration. We can’t afford to undercount our population,” he noted. As of July 2019, Baltimore had an estimated 593,490 residents, according to the Baltimore Sun. The report continued: That suggests Baltimore lost 8,953 people, or 1.5% of its population, from the previous year. While the city’s population has been trending downward for decades, it had some small increases during the administration of former Democratic Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, standing at more than 623,000 in 2014. In 2015, a report for the former mayor’s “Grow Baltimore” initiative highlighted some of the reasons why residents wanted to leave the city. The key factors were “daily stressors such as litter, parking, property crime and vacant housing; high property taxes and insurance rates; poor performing public schools and lack of information about school choice; and few market-rate housing choices for new retirees,” the Sun report noted. In December, Baltimore recorded its record-breaking 342nd homicide for the year, according to Breitbart News. “That placed the homicide rate at 57 per 100,000, which is a new record,” the report said. Despite the rise in crime and the fact that the city has lost an estimated 27,280 residents since 2010, Seema Iyer of the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance said officials need to make welcoming newcomers a priority. “We need that message to be very clear in the leadership — that we want people to move into the city of Baltimore, that we want them to be part of the city,” Iyer concluded.",Baltimore Population Falls Below 600K for First Time in over a Century,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/03/27/baltimore-population-falls-below-600k-first-time-century/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump on Thursday signed the Taiwan Allies and International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act, whose acronym in a remarkable coincidence spells out TAIPEI, the name of Taiwan’s capital.  The TAIPEI Act enhances U.S. support for Taiwan by encouraging other nations to engage with the island and punishing those who follow the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) orders to isolate it. “This bipartisan legislation demands a whole-of-government approach to ramp up our support for Taiwan, and will send a strong message to nations that there will be consequences for supporting Chinese actions that undermine Taiwan,” said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), who introduced the bill along with Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware in May. The bill enjoyed strong bipartisan support after some revisions and passed the House on a 415-0 vote. The Senate passed the final version of the TAIPEI Act with unanimous consent on March 11. A joint statement from Gardner and Coons highlighted the importance of the Act during the current crisis, stressing America’s determination to “support Taiwan’s participation in appropriate international organizations like the World Health Organization, which would help Taiwan respond to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and be able to share globally its expertise and knowledge in handling this crisis.” Taiwan was forced into observer status at the World Health Organization (WHO) by Communist China in 2009 and was blocked altogether after the election of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016.  During the coronavirus crisis, WHO uncritically relayed false information provided by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and inexcusably delayed declaring a global health emergency, while Taiwan devised the world’s most effective coronavirus response – in some ways benefiting from its separation from a World Health Organization compromised by CCP politics.  Taiwan still correctly objects to its exclusion as outrageous, and at this point the rest of the world is probably suffering more than Taiwan from keeping Beijing in and Taipei out. In February, Taiwan was able to get some of its experts into an online WHO meeting about the coronavirus by working directly with WHO leaders and freezing Beijing out of the discussion. The Chinese Communist government later claimed it had approved Taiwan’s request. As the Taiwanese Foreign Ministry pointed out in February, even after unleashing a historic global pandemic, the CCP still has enough sway over WHO to make it change its reports so they describe Taiwan as part of Communist China. Supporters of the TAIPEI Act also said it would be an important step toward reversing China’s economic and political campaign to isolate Taiwan by bribing and intimidating its allies into abandoning the island and switching their formal diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Eight of Taiwan’s allies have done so since President Tsai’s election, leaving it with 15. “The TAIPEI Act sends a clear message that the United States stands with Taiwan’s free-market democracy. I look forward to finding additional ways to support the positive role Taiwan plays in international affairs,” Sen. Coons said on Thursday. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO), Taiwan’s de facto embassy in the United States, on Thursday offered “big thanks to President Donald Trump and Congress’ staunch support for Taiwan.”  President Tsai said it was “gratifying” to see the TAIPEI Act signed into law, hailing it as a “testament to Taiwan-U.S. friendship and mutual support as we work together to address global threats to human health and our shared economic values.” “The bill reflects the strength of Taiwan-U.S. ties. It also paves the way for expanded bilateral exchanges while preserving the country’s international space in the face of authoritarian China’s campaign of coercion,” said the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese Communist Party is, unsurprisingly, less pleased with the TAIPEI Act. The Chinese Foreign Ministry actually threatened a “resolute strike back” if the law was implemented. “We urge the United States to correct its mistakes, not implement the law, or obstruct the development of relations between other countries and China, otherwise it will inevitably encounter a resolute strike back by China,” a Foreign Ministry spokesman warned. China stepped up its campaign of military intimidation against Taiwan after the coronavirus pandemic began, conducting provocative naval and air drills. Taiwanese citizens are increasingly angry about these provocations, which have included brief violations of Taiwan’s airspace by Chinese military jets.",Trump Signs TAIPEI Act to Increase U.S. Support for Taiwan,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/27/trump-signs-taipei-act-increase-u-s-support-taiwan/,Breitbart
"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo acknowledged Friday the state did have a stockpile of unused ventilators, despite his complaints the federal government was not sending enough. Cuomo responded to a comment from President Donald Trump on Twitter that there were thousands of ventilators in New York not being used. “Yes, they’re in a stockpile because that’s where they are supposed to be, because we don’t need them yet,” Cuomo said. “We need them for the apex, the apex isn’t here, so we’re gathering them in a stockpile.” Cuomo’s comments demonstrate there is not an immediate shortage in ventilators in the city, despite alarming reports. “We don’t need them today, because we’re not at capacity today, that’s why they’re not deployed because they’re not needed,” Cuomo said. The governor has repeatedly complained that the federal government is not sending enough ventilators to New York. On Tuesday, Pence said that the federal government had sent 2,000 ventilators to New York and an additional 2,000 more on Wednesday. But on Friday, Cuomo explained expert projections showed he would need up to 140,000 beds and 40,000 ventilators. “I don’t operate here on opinion, I operate on facts and on data and on numbers and on projections,” he said. In an interview on Fox News on Thursday night, Trump appeared skeptical that New York would need 40,000 ventilators. “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be,” he said. The topic of ventilators appeared to be on the president’s mind for most of Friday, as cable news repeatedly focused on a “shortage” and suggested that the president do more by invoking the Defense Production Act.

"New York will extended school closures by two weeks to April 15 as the state continues to see an increase in coronavirus cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Friday. “When you look at the number of cases that’s still increasing, it only makes sense to keep the schools closed,” Cuomo told reporters during his daily press briefing on his state’s efforts to combat the outbreak. The governor said the state has confirmed an additional 7,377 new cases overnight, boosting the total number of cases to 44,635. New York City has over 25,300 of such cases. One hundred thirty-four New York City residents have died due to the disease and 519 have patients have died statewide. “We want to see the rate slowing and then we want to see the number of cases going down or flattening,” Cuomo said, before urging hospitals to double their capacity from 53,000 hospital beds to over 100,000. “We’re asking hospitals to try to increase capacity 100% … We’re looking at converting dorms. We’re looking at converting hotels,” the governor stated. “This is an invisible beast. This is an insidious beast,” he added. As of Friday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is setting up temporary hospitals at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to increase capacity. The governor also announced he had issued orders closing New York City parks and playgrounds to counter a trend of crowds gathering there while the city is on lockdown. To provide residents with safer options for exercise and being outdoors, he said he was in negotiations with the city to close certain streets to car traffic. “People want to walk. They want to go out and get some air. You want a less dense area, so [we’ll] pilot closing streets to cars, opening streets to pedestrians,” Cuomo said. Addressing a pending $2 trillion economic stimulus bill pending before Congress, Cuomo said the amount going to New York was a “drop in the bucket” compared to the massive need created by the pandemic. The plan now under consideration by the U.S. Senate would send $3.8 billion to the state and less than $2 billion to the city, while under a House version, the state would get $17 billion. Although $3.8 billion “sounds like a lot of money,” Cuomo said, “we’re looking at a revenue shortfall of $9 billion, $10 billion, $15 billion. This response to this virus has probably already cost us $1 billion.” The UPI contributed to this report.",Coronavirus: New York Extends School Closures into Mid-April,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/coronavirus-new-york-extends-school-closures-into-mid-april/,Breitbart
"The New Orleans area has quickly become a coronavirus hotspot, and several medical experts say the Mardi Gras celebration during the week of February 25 played a big role. As of noon on Thursday, according to the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH), there were 2,305 cases of coronavirus in the state and 83 deaths. Forty-six of those deaths were in Orleans Parish, which borders the city of New Orleans and is part of the New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner Metropolitan Statistical Area. As the New York Times reported: Orleans Parish, which shares its borders with the city of New Orleans, has suffered the highest number of deaths per capita of any county in the nation. Of the parish’s 46 deaths — more than two times the death toll of Los Angeles County — 11 are from a single retirement home, where dozens more residents are infected. In a grim irony, there is a rising suspicion among medical experts that the crisis may have been accelerated by Mardi Gras — the weekslong citywide celebration that unfolds in crowded living rooms, ballrooms and city streets — which this year culminated on Feb. 25. It is the city’s trademark expression of joy — and an epidemiologist’s nightmare. “I think it all boils down to Mardi Gras,” said Dr. F. Brobson Lutz Jr., a former health director of New Orleans and a specialist in infectious disease. “The greatest free party in the world was a perfect incubator at the perfect time.” Houma Today reported that Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, gives credence to that view: “I will share a theory,” Edwards said Tuesday, acknowledging he isn’t an epidemiologist. “The first case confirmed 13 days after Fat Tuesday (Feb. 25) and happened in New Orleans. I happen to think a fair amount of (infection) was seeded (during Mardi Gras).” Edwards isn’t alone in his theory. Experts from Tulane University and Louisiana State University have said the weeks-long celebration likely did help the virus spread in Louisiana. Dr. Susanne Straif-Bourgeois, a professor of epidemiology at the LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans, said Edward’s statement during his press briefing was largely based on a model the flagship university provided to the governor’s office. “When we modeled it and put all the parameters into that model based on data we know at that point, I actually assumed — and my colleague who works at the state health department assumed — that it had to be around Mardi Gras that someone was infectious,” Straif-Bourgeois said. “Then by mid-March or…early March, you just saw the people who were infected and are very severely ill. But by that point it already had like two or three weeks to really go through the community, through the population, and therefore infect other people as well.” Another medical expert believes that underlying health conditions may have played a role in the dramatic increase of coronavirus in Louisiana, as NBC News reported: While anyone is susceptible to contracting the virus, doctors in New Orleans have noted certain populations appear to be more likely to suffer the most dire complications: those with obesity, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Louisiana consistently ranks near the bottom on state-by-state studies of those chronic diseases. “Unfortunately, we’re a very unhealthy population,” Dr. James Diaz, professor of public health and preventive medicine at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, said. On Thursday, a 17-year-old boy died of coronavirus in New Orleans, possibly the youngest victim of the pandemic in the United States to date, as NOLA reported: The teenager’s death was among 18 new COVID-19 fatalities reported in an update from the Louisiana Department of Health on Thursday. According to the Orleans Parish Coroner’s Office, while the youth had contracted COVID-19 before dying on Sunday, the cause of his death remained under investigation. The emergence of Louisiana and the New Orleans area as a coronavirus came on suddenly. Breitbart News identified one of the early signs of that emergence when it reported this week that one-third of the cases of coronavirus among veterans treated by the Veterans Health Administration around the country were found in the New Orleans VA Medical Center.",Medical Expert on Why New Orleans Area Now a Coronavirus Hotspot: ‘It All Boils Down to Mardi Gras’,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/medical-expert-why-new-orleans-area-coronavirus-hotspot-boils-down-mardi-gras/,Breitbart
"Democrat Rep.

We are in a global pandemic. Many Americans may perish unexpectedly and suddenly in unfair circumstances. These are not pleasant words to hear,” she continued, explaining that fear of the outbreak has “spread throughout our land.” “Listen to the scientists and doctors who have spent a lifetime in this space. Listen to Dr. Fauci, this is not a moment to provide the false comforts of times past,” she continued as her minute disappeared. Nevertheless, she persisted. “I rise before you adorned in these latex gloves, not for personal attention. I rise for every American who is scared right now,” she yelled, spurring a tense back and forth. She ultimately received 30 additional seconds to deliver her remarks, and she continued in doing so with a raised, anxious voice. “Sharing in the profession with those who have not come before you. Similar times of trying medical needs, wars and flus past. You will see darkness. You will be pushed — and our society needs you to stand together at this time,” she continued. “Our country loves you. To our doctors and our nurses, I wear these latex gloves to tell every American to not be afraid,” she yelled, running out her time.

"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) told Breitbart News Daily on Friday his legislation serves as a “long-term” solution to bringing back pharmaceutical manufacturing to America. Cotton spoke to Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow about his and Rep. Mike Gallagher’s (R-WI) Protecting our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain from China Act, which would end America’s dependence on China for pharmaceutical manufacturing. He told Breitbart News Daily that China is primarily responsible for the coronavirus outbreak, and that means the must reduce its reliance on China for producing “critical goods.” Cotton continued: Occasionally, we see people laying blame on politicians for this virus. Some folks want to blame politicians for this virus. Folks on CNN want to blame Donald Trump. You know, some people want to blame this or that governor for not going far enough, the same thing with the mayors. That’s not to say that any of them have made every decision correctly; none of those people are to blame for this situation. The virus is to blame and the virus is the responsibility of the Chinese Communist Party — for covering it up, for not getting ahead of it, and unleashing it all over the world,” Cotton explained. “That’s why we have to have a reckoning with China, and we have got to stop our dependence on China, especially for critical goods. It’s one thing to have lawn furniture or toys made in China; it’s another thing to have our most basic and essential pharmaceuticals [made in China]. Most Americans, until this virus didn’t realize that we are totally dependent on China for things like antibiotics and penicillin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, so that has to change.  China produces an overwhelming majority of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used for drugs in America. This includes 95 percent of imports of ibuprofen, 70 percent of acetaminophen, and 40-45 percent of penicillin. Axios reported that the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized the American supply of roughly 150 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, generics, and brand-name drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market. China exports 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of active ingredients used to make drugs in America. America is losing its ability to make pharmaceuticals because of Chinese dumping of low-price products into the global market. Cotton said that his legislation would bring back American manufacturing to the United States. “First, it both creates a market for U.S.-made pharmaceuticals by saying that federal government agencies that purchase drugs: Medicare, Medicaid, the military, the VA [Veterans Affairs Department], and others can only buy American-made products,” he explained. “It gives incentives to build that manufacturing capability here, so, for instance, it lets them write off the expense of building a new factory in terms of the building structures and so forth.” Cotton added, “But then it also has the stick that says: if you’re in China, you’re going to have to get out. Period. So that’s just the most urgent and critical need to bring back life-saving manufacturing from China.”  The legislation would: Cotton cautioned the country’s roadmap to becoming independent from China would have to “be much broader” than just his proposal. “We can’t continue to depend on China for anything that is critical for our nation,” he said.

"The Spanish government received thosuands of EU-certified coronavirus tests from a Chinese company, but tests of the first batch of 9,000 reveal that they do not work. Spain bought the devices in hopes of rolling out mass testing of its population. After being tested by several microbiology facilities in the country, the Chinese tests were found to only have an accuracy rate of 30 per cent, where they should have been closer to 80 per cent. The tests have been returned to the manufacturer. An anonymous source involved in the evaluation told El País on Thursday: “They do not detect the positive cases as expected.” “With that value, it does not make sense to use these tests,” the anonymous source said. The Spanish health ministry said: “The first tests on the rapid testing kits were carried out simultaneously by a hospital in Madrid and by the Carlos III Health Institute, and as soon as their low sensitivity was discovered, they were withdrawn. The supplier has been contacted and replacement tests will be provided.” Spanish Army Finds Bodies of Abandoned Coronavirus Victims in Nursing Homes https://t.co/qcrmnPWqVH — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 24, 2020  The Guardian reports that the products, made by the Shenzen Bioeasy Biotechnology Company Limited in Guandong province, held EU certification — which meant that they should have conformed to European standards. The ministry’s statement added: “Spain follows EU regulation, which means that if a product is certified to conform to European standards, it can be bought and sold throughout the union area.” The Chinese embassy in Madrid, however, claimed that the Spanish government had bought the tests from an unlicensed company, according to euractiv, and that Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology was not on a list of recommended suppliers. Yahoo News reports that coronavirus tests bought by the Czech government are also reportedly displaying a low success rate.

All the countries are fighting to secure domestic production, fighting to get supplies from China.” Spain has already on order €432 million ($471.4 million/£386.3 million) worth of medical supplies from China, with Chinese companies being accused of profiteering off of the devastation caused by the Chinese virus. A diplomatic source in Spain told Reuters that costs had gone up ten-fold in some cases, with Chinese companies demanding payment up-front. Chinese coronavirus fatalities in Spain now exceed the official death toll of Chinai tself, with Thursday seeing the country’s highest fatality rate: 769 deaths in 24 hours.

"A 101-year-old Italian man born during the Spanish flu pandemic left the hospital on Thursday after beating the Chinese coronavirus. An Italian man – known as Mr. P. – battled the infection and won, according to a report by the local media outlet Rimini Today, which added Mr. P. has been discharged from a hospital in Rimini, Italy, and has returned home to his family. “This morning, I was given some news,” said Rimini’s vice mayor, Gloria Lisi. “Mr. P., positive of Covid-19, was discharged from the Infermi hospital in Rimini and returned home.” “Mr. P. from Rimini was born in 1919, in the midst of another tragic world pandemic,” added Lisi. The vice mayor had been referring to the Spanish flu pandemic, which killed tens of millions of people around the world between 1918 and 1920. “One hundred and one years old, a century lived almost entirely, and then this first glimpse of the new Millennium,” continued Lisi. “Mr. P. saw everything, war, hunger, pain, progress, crisis, and resurrections.” “Once over the 100-year-old barrier, destiny has put before him this new challenge, invisible and terrible at the same time,” she added. Mr. P. was hospitalized in Rimini last week after he was confirmed to be positive with the Chinese coronavirus. The 101-year-old man’s ability to beat the coronavirus offers a glimmer of hope for the tens of thousands of people infected with the disease in Italy. On Thursday, an additional 712 people died in Italy from the Chinese virus in just 24 hours, bringing the nation’s overall death toll to 8,215. “A hope for the future of all of us in the body of a person over one hundred years old, when the sad chronicles of these weeks mechanically tell every day of a virus that is raging above all on the elderly,” said Lisi. “And he did it.

"In a Friday interview on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Rep. Max Rose (D-NY) reacted to libertarian Rep.

A heated Rose slammed Massie, saying there will be “blood” on his hands if he delays the vote 24 hours. Rose also said Massie holding up the package is “disgusting,” “inhumane” and “un-American.” “So, let me take a moment and talk about Thomas Massie because I don’t take his actions or his threats so lightly,” Rose emphasized. “Every single day, constituents of mine, residents of my district Staten Island and South Brooklyn are dying. We see New York City, New York State, the epicenter of this crisis and that crisis will move on to other places in America.” He continued, “We have never seen a threat like this. So, Thomas Massie, this is disgusting. This is inhumane. You aren’t a libertarian, you’re un-American. If we push this back 24 hours there will be blood on Thomas Massie’s hands, anyone else who steps in the way of this, blood on their hands. We’ve got to get the money out into hospitals pockets; PPE for our first responders.

Rogan featured one clip of Biden’s awkward exchange with MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace, which began after the presidential hopeful asked, “Why doesn’t he [Trump] just act like a president?” Wallace, who had begun her next question, said, “Donald Trump was asked on…” Biden apologized again: “Sorry.” Wallace said, “Go ahead.” Biden said, “No. No. Probably best I don’t.” Wallace laughed as she said, “All right.” “That’s not even the worst example,” Rogan said of the clip, moving on to Biden’s Tuesday appearance on ABC’s The View. “We have to take care of the cure.

On the question of “how confident are you that the federal government will be able to handle the outbreak of the coronavirus in this country,” 66 percent are “very” or “somewhat” confident, while only 32 percent said they are “not so” or “not at all” confident. When asked this same question about Obama’s federal government response to the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak, 63 percent said they were confident, while 36 percent said they were not. Obama’s federal government did fare better during the Zika outbreak in 2016 (69 percent vs. 29 percent) and the 2009 Swine Flu (69 percent vs. 31 percent). The Bird Flu outbreak that occurred under the George W. Bush administration in 2006 scored lower than the Trump government on the question of confidence in the government: 59 percent vs. 40 percent. In this same poll, Trump’s overall job approval rating sits at a very healthy 48 percent approval, 46 percent disapproval; the first time in this poll his approval number has been higher than his disapproval number. When this poll was taken a month ago, on February 17, Trump was underwater by ten points, 43 percent approval, 53 percent disapproval — so that is a 12-point swing in his favor in just a month. The Washington Post poll also asked if respondents believed Trump was too slow in taking action to address the coronavirus, and by a 20-point margin people said he was: 58 to 38 percent. This is not the first poll to show that more Americans are confident in Trump’s leadership than Obama’s. A Gallup poll from February 20 showed that 77 percent are very or somewhat confident in the federal government’s ability to handle the coronavirus, with just 22 percent saying they are less confident. Gallup did similar polls during health crises reaching back to the Bird Flu in 2005, here’s the confident/not confident breakdown: Overall, the Washington Post numbers are directly in line with what we are seeing from other pollsters. In the RealClearPolitics poll of polls, Trump’s average job approval rating sits at 47.3 percent, the best of his presidency. The average approval of the job he’s doing handling the coronavirus sits at 50.6 percent, with only 45 percent disapproving. We have a long way to go. No one should spike the political football yet. But these numbers are instructive, especially when you realize the advantages Obama had and the disadvantages faced by Trump — namely, billions of corporate political dollars by way of the establishment media. The corporate media put all its energies into protecting Obama from criticism and covering up his errors, while this same fake news media is trying to bury Trump. It’s worth repeating, though, that the public is overwhelmingly pleased with the way everyone is responding to this crisis … except for the media. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"Senate Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi successfully blocked swift passage of a coronavirus rescue package bill, but they did not get much from Republicans in return. In the days following the negotiations, Republicans repeatedly swatted down additions to the bill proposed by Schumer, Pelosi, and Senate Democrats, despite their best efforts to deliver for select special interests. Senate Democrats made a number of demands in the bill outside of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s wish-list bill that was 1,400 pages long, with no chances of getting passed. “We weren’t going to give in to their demands,” a senior Republican leadership aide told Breitbart News. “This was not the time or the place, this was an emergency.” Although Republicans ultimately allowed $75 million for public television and radio, $150 million for the Arts and Humanities, and $25 million for the Kennedy Center, several Democrat proposals were blocked. Here are the top six items that Senate Republicans kept out of the bill, despite political pressure from the Democrats: Ultimately, Senate Democrats successfully achieved big increases in unemployment insurance payments, something that even drew protests from select Senate Republicans. But Republicans expressed satisfaction that the president and McConnell retained the proposal to send direct checks to the American people, which was something that many Democrats opposed. “If Chuck Schumer had his way, he would have eliminated the direct checks,” one Senate Republican aide told Breitbart News.",Top Six Awful Democrat Ideas Senate Republicans Blocked from Coronavirus Bill,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/five-awful-democrat-ideas-senate-republicans-blocked-from-coronavirus-bill/,Breitbart
"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said in an interview with NPR this week that he is still reassessing his campaign and admitted that it is a “very steep road” to the Democrat nomination. “It’s changing every day because elections are being delayed,” Sanders told Morning Edition‘s Noel King. “Where do we go from here with the elections that are being delayed, where we can’t go out and hold rallies or knock on doors? That’s what we’re looking at right now,” he continued. Following Sanders’ string of losses in the March primaries, his campaign signaled that it was reassessing, but the coronavirus outbreak quickly unfolded, causing him to switch gears. As a result, Sanders essentially paused his go-to campaign talking points and stump speeches to focus on the pandemic, holding several virtual town halls on the subject. However, he has used the crisis to push one of his hallmark campaign issues: Medicare for All. He told King: I think there is growing sentiment in this country that people now understand that it is incomprehensible that we remain the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all, that we have an economy which leaves half of our people…living paycheck to paycheck. Still, Sanders showed no signs of immediate departure from the race, telling King that, unlike his opponent Joe Biden (D), he sees immense value in holding further debates. “I think the American people, especially in this unprecedented moment in American history, want to hear the ideas that will lead us away from where we are right now,” Sanders said. “These are enormously important issues and we need serious debates over them,” he added. The former vice president holds a stark edge in delegate totals: 1,217 to Sanders’ 914. Sanders admitted, though, that “it’s going to be a very steep road” to secure the nomination.",Bernie Sanders Assessing Campaign: It Is a ‘Very Steep Road’ to Nomination,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/bernie-sanders-assessing-campaign-very-steep-road-nomination/,Breitbart
"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for Coronavirus, making him the first world leader known to have contracted the disease. I’m glad that he has it — not because I wish him ill but because as I explain here you usually feel so much better once you have recovered, which I certainly hope and expect he will. I had my own brush with Covid-19 at the beginning of February. Everyone’s experience is different, of course, but I’d say that as a rule the fear it engenders is worse than the disease itself. Before you get it, it’s quite nerve-wracking. “Will I be one of the unlucky ones who needs hospital treatment? What if I get it really badly and there are no ventilators?” Afterwards you feel more relaxed, smug almost, because you’ve developed a degree of immunity. Because we live in such hysterical times, fuelled by a mainstream media with an insatiable appetite for “This is worse than the Black Death” anecdotage, lots of armchair experts become indignant and defensive about the very concept of acquired immunity. “Ah, but what about the Japanese man who was re-infected? You can get it more than once!” they insist, as if totally affronted by the outrageous notion that this pandemic will ever end. Perhaps that Japanese man — and the other small number of cited cases — really was re-infected. But that still more likely makes him an outlier than it makes him terrifying proof that we’re all going to catch this terrible disease again and again until we die. BREAKING: Boris Johnson Tests Positive for Coronavirus, Self-Isolating https://t.co/f5dJEfrvc2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 27, 2020  Some people have been so unhinged by this pandemic that they almost seem to be willing the Apocalypse to arrive. Their judgement has been warped by fear, causing them to demand ever more stringent government measures to allay their panic, making them behave like paranoid, authoritarian snitches rather than decent human beings with a sense of perspective. With luck, when Boris has got over this he will have acquired a better appreciation that fear of coronavirus is worse than the disease, and that the extreme measures being adopted to control the pandemic are actually going to do far more long term damage than the virus. What he’ll also appreciate, I hope, is just how imperative and urgent it is to roll out antibody tests as quickly as possible. The sooner we can all be tested for antibodies, the sooner those of us who have had coronavirus (or are 99 per cent sure we have) can be released back to the big wide world and get on with our jobs. The battle being fought on by the overworked medics in our hospitals is important. But getting our economies back in action sooner rather than later is more vital still.

"Friday on CNN, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) urged President Donald Trump to “lead instead of blaming the governors,” referring to the escalating coronavirus outbreak in America. Anchor Dana Bash asked, “We have heard before the segment of the governor of New York saying the ventilators are desperately needed, and we are hearing that from the governor of Michigan and growing numbers of governors and local leaders across the country. There continues to be the blame game going on between those state leaders and the president and people in the administration. As a senator, how do you want this to be resolved right now?” Klobuchar said, “I want the president to lead and not spend a quarter of his press conferences blaming other people and going after governors. I want the president —I wish he had planned ahead when this was happening in China in terms of getting those mass tests ready to go and getting those approved right away on the serum. I think that’s what we should be doing now and equipment for people in the hospitals. He has to do everything he can to lead and not say he’s a backup. This is a national pandemic.

"The House passed a substantial emergency relief bill on Friday afternoon that would provide aid to the small businesses, hospitals, and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The House passed H.R. 748, the CARES Act, by voice vote. The legislation costs roughly $2 trillion and is approximately 8,800-pages long. The House vote follows as the Senate unanimously passed the legislation on Wednesday night, with 96 votes in favor of the bill and no senators opposed to the bill. The House became enflamed in controversy after Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) threatened to force a recorded vote on the coronavirus package. The backlash engendered frustration from lawmakers as well as President Donald Trump, who demanded that Republicans throw the Kentucky congressman out of office. “WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party!” Trump wrote on Twitter. When Massie tried to force a recorded vote on the legislation, the House overwhelmed the congressman and passed the coronavirus package. House lawmakers took up spots in the House public gallery to create more space between members of Congress while maintaining a quorum to prevent Massie from placing a recorded vote on the measure. Wow!Members are now taking up spots in the public gallery above the actual House floor. Staff are opening more doors for more members to go to the gallery above. Looks as if they’ll socially distance that way. And establish a quorum, defeating Massie. — Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) March 27, 2020  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) said on the floor before the vote: We answer with faith in ourselves and our abilities, faith in our free enterprise system, our amazing health care system, and yes, faith that when the chips are down Congress can come together with our President to help hard working families and businesses when they need it most. We answer the door at this crucial moment with faith in our Creator and faith in our great American spirit. This is the challenge of a lifetime. But if we keep pulling together, passing this bill without delay, we take another step toward that day when we answer the door and fear is no longer be there.” House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said before the vote that the bill represents Congress’s commitment to helping the country combat the pandemic. He said: This bill is not only a rescue package, it’s a commitment — a commitment that your government … and the people whom you elected to serve you … will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future. If you do your part, I promise: we will do ours. Madame Speaker — as I said earlier, it is our responsibility to act…to put aside our differences and to do what’s right for the American people.

"Texas Roadhouse founder and CEO W. Kent Taylor is committing to forgoing his base salary and bonus for the year in order to pay employees during the coronavirus pandemic, a spokesperson confirmed on Thursday. A spokesperson for Taylor confirmed to the Hill that the CEO will, in fact, forgo his base salary and bonus from March 18, 2020, to January 7, 2021, as an effort to pay his employees as the coronavirus pandemic takes a hit on the economy, especially battering the restaurant industry. Taylor’s base salary is roughly $525,000, as is his bonus. “On a prorated basis, the forgone salary and bonus would be just under a $1 million donation to employees,” the spokesperson said. “Kent Taylor has always said that Texas Roadhouse is a People-company that just happens to serve great steaks. His donation of his salary and bonus to help employees is the embodiment of that saying,” he added. “We are blessed to have his leadership.” Additionally, Taylor has donated $5 million to Andy’s Outreach “which he described as charitable fund that help support the company’s employees during ‘times of need,'” according to the Hill. While the Texas Roadhouse chain, which has over 460 locations in the United States, remains open for takeout, dine-in services have been halted. “We are open for business and still serving America even though many of our dining rooms are temporarily closed,” Taylor said in a statement posted to the restaurant’s website. “As the President and other officials have stated, restaurants play a vital role in our nation’s food supply, and we are going to help fill the gap where and how we can,” he said, adding that they are “ramping up our To-Go and Curbside services and we are also turning some of our parking lots into temporary drive-thrus to serve our regular menu.” “The bottom line is these are challenging times, and we are all in this together. We will continue to do our best to adapt to your needs and help support every community we serve in a safe way,” he continued, adding that “local communities across America will be stronger on the other side of this crisis.” The CEO’s decision comes as jobless claims in the United States soar, jumping to 3,283,000.

"A Michigan emergency room nurse on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic issued a dire warning and chilling update on the reality of the virus and the strain it is having on hospitals, begging people to stay home and warning that “it’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy.” Mary MacDonald, who works for the Ascension Health System, posted a viral update on Instagram this week, detailing her experience after working at the Southfield location to assist with an influx of patients. “I’ll have to admit, in being totally transparent, if you had asked me ten-plus days ago if I thought this was going to get as bad as it was, I would have told you no,” she said in the video:     Dear Family, Friends and Complete Strangers,  Please STAY HOME!! Love, an ER Nurse A post shared by  Mary Macdonald (@marymac019) on Mar 23, 2020 at 7:32pm PDT “I mean, you heard the rumors. You saw the trends. But until you see if first hand, you just have no idea what it’s like — what’s it’s going to be like. And it’s truly frightening,” she continued, explaining that they are now seeing double — even triple — the number of patients coming in, many of whom are not getting tested. Coming into the hospital, she said, does not serve to benefit a person unless he or she is experiencing “respiratory distress,” and even then, the hospitals are quickly running low on vital supplies to treat those patients — from ventilators to Tylenol. “It’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy. We intubated, from 10:00 p.m. last night to this morning, we intubated two of my patients within a half hour. And upwards of ten patients were put on ventilators. My patient took the last ventilator available in the hospital,” she said, further detailing the chilling new reality. “Resources are very slim. We have no medications to keep these patients even ventilated, let alone ventilators,” she said. “Medications like fentanyl or propofol that would keep a patient sedated while they’re intubated we’re out of. … We’re out of Tylenol.” “And that’s not even going back to the fact that we don’t have any ventilators to put these patients on, so we’re going to start making life or death decisions in regards to people’s care,” she said. “So you’re going to come in and you’re going to get tagged whether you deem necessary to even get intubated, or are you being sent home to die,” she added: Normally, if a patient was to pass away, it would be because we tried everything that we could, we did everything that we could, we had all the resources and all the people that we needed to help save this patient’s life, and it was just their time. And now, we aren’t giving the patient the time to choose whether it’s their time or not. We’re choosing for them. “I never wanted to go into a career where I wasn’t able to save everyone,” the nurse said. “This is truly scary, and nobody is taking it seriously,” she continued, noting the pictures on social media of spring breakers partying on beaches and others not practicing proper social distancing. Hospitals are also running out of gloves, and medical professionals are forced to reuse masks “because we are completely out of resources,” MacDonald continued. “There are no masks. There are no gowns. They’re running low on gloves because everyone has panicked and stockpiled this so that medical staff doesn’t have it,” she said, showing the camera the brown paper bag she uses to transport her mask to and from work. “We cannot stay safe, and we cannot care for all of these people that are coming in because no one is taking this seriously. And I am being super transparent. I was one of those people that wasn’t taking it seriously,” she said. “But I’m here to tell you that you need to. We are literally making life and death decisions for people,” MacDonald added, begging people to heed her advice and stay home. “Stay home with your loved ones. Don’t go out. Don’t go to the grocery store. Don’t go through the drive-thrus. Don’t do anything that could put you at risk to have to see me at the end of the tunnel,” she said. “I’m telling you it’s not worth it. And I don’t know what I can do to save people anymore, and that is something I’ve never wanted to say in my entire career.” Her warning comes as Michigan emerges as one of the United States’ latest coronavirus hotspots, with nearly 3,000 confirmed cases and 60 related deaths, including a Detroit mother of four.

"A draft letter by one of southeast Michigan’s major hospital systems was leaked online Thursday revealing the hospital’s policy to prioritize care for “patients who have the best chance of getting better” in the event of a shortage due to the coronavirus pandemic. The letter was drafted by officials at the Henry Ford Health System and is addressed to “our patients, families and community.” It outlines the criteria for which patients will be eligible for care if the hospital reaches capacity and is forced to ration limited resources. “Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care.” The letter explains the policy in the event of a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators: “If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition.” Some of the conditions that may make a person ineligible are listed as “severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; Terminal cancers; Severe trauma or burns.” A statement issued Thursday night by Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of Henry Ford Health System, confirmed the authenticity of the draft letter, but stressed that it reflects a “worst case scenario.” “With a pandemic of this nature, health systems must be prepared for a worst case scenario,” Munkarah said. “Gathering the collective wisdom from across our industry, we carefully crafted our policy to provide critical guidance to healthcare workers for making difficult patient care decisions during an unprecedented emergency.” He added, “These guidelines are deeply patient focused, intended to be honoring to patients and families. We shared our policy with our colleagues across Michigan to help others develop similar, compassionate approaches. It is our hope we never have to apply them and we will always do everything we can to care for our patients, utilizing every resource we have to make that happen.” As your trusted healthcare provider, our duty is to be prepared for worst case scenarios. Yesterday you may have seen an internal policy that has been circulated but not yet implemented. Here is our response: pic.twitter.com/W1orpUUJ5t — Henry Ford News (@HenryFordNews) March 27, 2020  The draft letter was leaked online Thursday when Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, tweeted out an image of the letter on what appeared to be official hospital letterhead. The full contents of the letter was printed by the Detroit Free Press (emphasis in original): To our patients, families and community: Please know that we care deeply about you and your family’s health and are doing our best to protect and serve you and our community. We currently have a public health emergency that is making our supply of some medical resources hard to find. Because of shortages, we will need to be careful with resources. Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care. What this means for you and your family: 1. Alert staff during triage of any current medical conditions or if you have a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) or other important medical information. 2. If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition. 3. Some patients will be extremely sick and very unlikely to survive their illness even with critical treatment. Treating these patients would take away resources for patients who might survive. 4. Patients who are not eligible for ICU or ventilator care will receive treatment for pain control and comfort measures. Some conditions that are likely to may [sic] make you not eligible include: 5. Patients who have ventilator or ICU care withdrawn will receive pain control and comfort measures. 6. Patients who are treated with a ventilator or ICU care may have these treatments stopped if they do not improve over time. If they do not improve this means that the patient has a poor chance of surviving the illness — even if the care was continued. This decision will be based on medical condition and likelihood of getting better. It will not be based on other reasons such as race, gender, health insurance status, ability to pay for care, sexual orientation, employment status or immigration status. All patients are evaluated for survival using the same measures. 7. If the treatment team has determined that you or your family members does not meet criteria to receive critical care or that ICU treatments will be stopped, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can ask for a review by a team of medical experts (a Clinical Review Committee evaluation.) Michigan has become an emerging hot spot for the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The state’s top health official, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, said hospitals in southeast Michigan are “at or near capacity.” The Henry Ford Health System is one of the major hospital providers in the Metro Detroit area, along with the William Beaumont Health System. Both providers have said they were caring for more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients at their 13 hospitals. Due to the sudden surge, operating rooms were being converted into intensive care units, and clinics had been turned into rooms for patients needing other medical care. On Wednesday, Beaumont Health said its hospitals were swamped with 650 patients who had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and more than 200 with tests pending. It said it would transfer more people to its hospital in Wayne County and get help from other health care providers. “The number of patients coming to our emergency rooms continues to grow rapidly,” Beaumont CEO John Fox said. Fox told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday that the pandemic is proving to be healthcare providers’ “worst nightmare,” noting that Beaumont is admitting 100 new coronavirus patients per day, at that time. “What we all need to remember is that we got our first patient two weeks ago. So this is coming on hard and fast. This is definitely a biological tsunami,” he said. “In my lifetime, we’ve never had a pandemic like this,” Fox said. “Across our system, we are facing limitations and nearing capacity with our staffing, personal protective equipment, and mechanical ventilators,” said Beaumont’s chief operating officer Carolyn Wilson. “The numbers are changing and increasing even in two-hour intervals,” said Bob Riney, the chief operating officer at Henry Ford, whose flagship hospital is in the city of Detroit. Dr. Betty Chu, the chief clinical officer and chief quality officer at Henry Ford, predicted an “upcoming surge.” Chu noted that the hospital was already reallocating resources because the Henry Ford hospitals in West Bloomfield and Detroit have reached capacity due to COVID-19 patients. “Today our capacity is quite full at those two hospitals — West Bloomfield and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit,” Chu said Wednesday. “We fortunately have the luxury right now of having additional capacity at some of our other campuses.” On Wednesday, Mary Macdonald, an Oakland County ER nurse, posted a viral video on Instagram detailing the harrowing conditions at southeast Michigan hospitals where medical staff are combating shortages of essential supplies and equipment to care for this surge of coronavirus patients. “It’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy,” Macdonald said. “From 10:00 PM last night to this morning, we intubated two of my patients within a half-hour. And upwards of 10 patients were put on ventilators. My patient took the last ventilator available in the hospital,” she said. “Normally, if a patient was to pass away, it would be because we tried everything that we could, we did everything that we could, we had all the resources and all the people that we needed to help save this patient’s life, and it was just their time. And now we aren’t giving the patient the time to choose whether it’s their time or not. We’re choosing for them,” she said. Macdonald also noted that the hospital is short of even basic supplies. “Resources are very slim. We have no medications to keep these patients even ventilated, let alone ventilators,” she said, adding that they are out of medications like propofol to keep people sedated when they are intubated. She said they are even running out of Tylenol. “There are no masks. There are no gowns. They’re running low on gloves because everyone has panicked and stockpiled this, so that medical staff doesn’t have it,” she said and then showed the disposable N95 mask she was required to stow in a brown paper bag after every workday to be reused for the rest of the year. Macdonald urged her fellow Michiganders to take the social distancing instructions seriously in order to protect themselves and their neighbors from spreading the virus, otherwise the overwhelmed hospital system won’t be able to care for all the sick. “We don’t have any ventilators to put these patients on,” Macdonald stressed. “So, we’re going to start making life or death decisions in regards to people’s care. So you’re going to come in and you’re going to get tagged whether you [are] deem[ed] necessary to even get intubated or are you being sent home to die. This is truly scary, and nobody is taking it seriously.”     Dear Family, Friends and Complete Strangers,  Please STAY HOME!! Love, an ER Nurse A post shared by  Mary Macdonald (@marymac019) on Mar 23, 2020 at 7:32pm PDT Khaldun, the chief medical office for Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services, said the state is “probably a few weeks out” from hitting a peak in coronavirus cases. Michigan reported nearly 2,900 cases by Thursday and 60 deaths, both an increase of Wednesday’s statewide numbers. Wayne County, home to Detroit, accounted for nearly half of the cases. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, called Wayne a “hot spot” nationally and said she was concerned the county was “having a more rapid increase.” Southeast Michigan, like New York City, is a hub for international travel. As the capital of the world’s auto industry, Metro Detroit has daily direct flights to and from the Motor City to various major cities in Europe and Asia. Detroit is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite its dramatic economic rebound in recent years after its municipal bankruptcy in 2013, the city is still one of the poorest cities in the nation, with a poverty rate three times higher than the national average, and the city’s population suffers in greater numbers from underlining conditions like diabetes and heart disease. “Part of what we’re seeing in Detroit is that there’s such a high number of individuals who have those underlying conditions, who have diabetes and the heart disease, who may have obesity,” Khaldun explained. On Tuesday, Marlowe Stoudamire, 43, one of the young entrepreneurs involved in rebuilding the city, died from complications from COVID-19. According to health officials at Henry Ford Health System, Stoudamire had “no known underlying health conditions or recent travel.” The City of Detroit’s police force has also been hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic, as 331 Detroit officers and 70 civilian police employees have been quarantined since the outbreak, and two members of the force have died this week due to COVID-19.

"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is threatening doctors who over-prescribe chloroquine, a proven malaria drug that President Trump has touted as potentially effective in combating coronavirus, by demanding they turn in any colleagues who do. The Detroit News opinion page was the first to note that Whitmer’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs sent a letter to doctors and pharmacists on March 24 warning of professional consequences of prescribing the drug, which has reportedly been effective in other parts of the world. According to the letter: Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other ailments for which chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are proven treatments. Reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action. Prescribing any kind of prescription must also be associated with medical documentation showing proof of the medical necessity and medical condition for which the patient is being treated. Again, these are drugs that have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19. The letter requires pharmacists to police — and potentially second-guess — the health recommendations of doctors. “A pharmacist shall not fill a prescription if the pharmacist believes the prescription will be used for other than legitimate medical purposes or if the prescription could cause harm to a patient,” the letter stated. The communication urged healthcare professionals to turn in colleagues they believe may be violating the threatening order: It is also important to be mindful that licensed health professionals are required to report inappropriate prescribing practices. LARA appreciates all licensed health professionals for their service and cooperation in assuring compliance in acting responsibly while continuing to provide the best possible care for Michigan’s citizens during this unprecedented and very challenging time. The News noted Henry Ford Hospital and the University of Michigan — two premier healthcare facilities in the state — have both been using chloroquine and azithromycin to treat patients with coronavirus symptoms. It is not clear if that will stop because of the governor’s letter. “During a time of crisis, in which physicians continue to see patients despite not having enough protective gear, this threatening, authoritarian stance from our governor is counterproductive at best,” the News opined.

"Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) is urging all travelers entering the state to self-quarantine for 14 days, he announced on Friday. Baker said officials in the Bay State are “doing everything we can to keep people at home and prevent the spread.” As part of that effort, Baker is urging travelers entering the state, specifically those traveling via plane or train, to self-isolate for two weeks. “Here in Massachusetts we’re doing everything we can to keep people at home and prevent the spread,” he stated at a Friday press conference. “Starting today, all travelers allowed into the commonwealth are instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days.” Pamphlets will be distributed to travelers, and drivers “will see pamphlets at rest stops and see the message on digital highway signs,” according to Boston 10. “I would call it at this point instruction and advisory,” Baker emphasized, noting that there is “no enforcement at this point.” The governor also urged travelers to rethink their travel plans and steer clear of Massachusetts communities if they are experiencing symptoms of the virus. “We are taking extraordinary steps here to keep our residents safe, including asking folks to stay home and closing nonessential businesses,” he said. “Every which decision comes with a certain amount of pain, frustration and disruption for the people of the commonwealth,” he added. Baker issued a stay-at-home order this week, resulting in the statewide shutdown of businesses deemed “nonessential.” The order is slated to stay in effect until April 7. Schools are closed until May 4. As of Friday afternoon, the state had over 2,400 coronavirus cases and 25 related deaths. Baker’s call for self-isolation follows Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) executive order, requiring all travelers from the New York Tri-State area, a hotspot of the virus, to self-isolate. Violation of the order is “actually a criminal offense,” DeSantis noted upon his announcement.",Massachusetts Gov.

"Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-SC) announced Friday that he has tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus and is in self-quarantine. Cunningham, a freshman congressman, began self-isolating March 19 after coming into contact with a lawmaker who was infected with the deadly illness. The South Carolina Democrat said he received his test result today. “I have been in contact with my doctor since I entered self-quarantine. Yesterday, my doctor instructed me to get tested for COVID-19 and following a virtual consultation on MUSC.care, I went to my local testing clinic. Today, I learned that I tested positive,” he said in a statement. “While my symptoms have begun to improve, I will remain at home until I know it is safe to leave self-quarantine. I will continue to tele-work from home as Congress conducts its ongoing response to this public health crisis and my office will continue its urgent work of serving the people of the Lowcountry.” Cunningham’s announcement comes as the House voted to approve the CARES Act — a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package aimed at easing the financial strain incurred by Americans across the country due to the coronavirus outbreak. Cunningham is the third congressman to contract the coronavirus, joining Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) and Ben McAdams (D-UT), who caught the illness earlier March. Last week, Sen.

"A draft letter by one of southeast Michigan’s major hospital systems was leaked online Thursday revealing the hospital’s policy to prioritize care for “patients who have the best chance of getting better” in the event of a shortage due to the coronavirus pandemic. The letter was drafted by officials at the Henry Ford Health System and is addressed to “our patients, families and community.” It outlines the criteria for which patients will be eligible for care if the hospital reaches capacity and is forced to ration limited resources. “Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care.” The letter explains the policy in the event of a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators: “If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition.” Some of the conditions that may make a person ineligible are listed as “severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; Terminal cancers; Severe trauma or burns.” A statement issued Thursday night by Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of Henry Ford Health System, confirmed the authenticity of the draft letter, but stressed that it reflects a “worst case scenario.” “With a pandemic of this nature, health systems must be prepared for a worst case scenario,” Munkarah said. “Gathering the collective wisdom from across our industry, we carefully crafted our policy to provide critical guidance to healthcare workers for making difficult patient care decisions during an unprecedented emergency.” He added, “These guidelines are deeply patient focused, intended to be honoring to patients and families. We shared our policy with our colleagues across Michigan to help others develop similar, compassionate approaches. It is our hope we never have to apply them and we will always do everything we can to care for our patients, utilizing every resource we have to make that happen.” As your trusted healthcare provider, our duty is to be prepared for worst case scenarios. Yesterday you may have seen an internal policy that has been circulated but not yet implemented. Here is our response: pic.twitter.com/W1orpUUJ5t — Henry Ford News (@HenryFordNews) March 27, 2020  The draft letter was leaked online Thursday when Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, tweeted out an image of the letter on what appeared to be official hospital letterhead. The full contents of the letter was printed by the Detroit Free Press (emphasis in original): To our patients, families and community: Please know that we care deeply about you and your family’s health and are doing our best to protect and serve you and our community. We currently have a public health emergency that is making our supply of some medical resources hard to find. Because of shortages, we will need to be careful with resources. Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care. What this means for you and your family: 1. Alert staff during triage of any current medical conditions or if you have a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) or other important medical information. 2. If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition. 3. Some patients will be extremely sick and very unlikely to survive their illness even with critical treatment. Treating these patients would take away resources for patients who might survive. 4. Patients who are not eligible for ICU or ventilator care will receive treatment for pain control and comfort measures. Some conditions that are likely to may [sic] make you not eligible include: 5. Patients who have ventilator or ICU care withdrawn will receive pain control and comfort measures. 6. Patients who are treated with a ventilator or ICU care may have these treatments stopped if they do not improve over time. If they do not improve this means that the patient has a poor chance of surviving the illness — even if the care was continued. This decision will be based on medical condition and likelihood of getting better. It will not be based on other reasons such as race, gender, health insurance status, ability to pay for care, sexual orientation, employment status or immigration status. All patients are evaluated for survival using the same measures. 7. If the treatment team has determined that you or your family members does not meet criteria to receive critical care or that ICU treatments will be stopped, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can ask for a review by a team of medical experts (a Clinical Review Committee evaluation.) Michigan has become an emerging hot spot for the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The state’s top health official, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, said hospitals in southeast Michigan are “at or near capacity.” The Henry Ford Health System is one of the major hospital providers in the Metro Detroit area, along with the William Beaumont Health System. Both providers have said they were caring for more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients at their 13 hospitals. Due to the sudden surge, operating rooms were being converted into intensive care units, and clinics had been turned into rooms for patients needing other medical care. On Wednesday, Beaumont Health said its hospitals were swamped with 650 patients who had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and more than 200 with tests pending. It said it would transfer more people to its hospital in Wayne County and get help from other health care providers. “The number of patients coming to our emergency rooms continues to grow rapidly,” Beaumont CEO John Fox said. Fox told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday that the pandemic is proving to be healthcare providers’ “worst nightmare,” noting that Beaumont is admitting 100 new coronavirus patients per day, at that time. “What we all need to remember is that we got our first patient two weeks ago. So this is coming on hard and fast. This is definitely a biological tsunami,” he said. “In my lifetime, we’ve never had a pandemic like this,” Fox said. “Across our system, we are facing limitations and nearing capacity with our staffing, personal protective equipment, and mechanical ventilators,” said Beaumont’s chief operating officer Carolyn Wilson. “The numbers are changing and increasing even in two-hour intervals,” said Bob Riney, the chief operating officer at Henry Ford, whose flagship hospital is in the city of Detroit. Dr. Betty Chu, the chief clinical officer and chief quality officer at Henry Ford, predicted an “upcoming surge.” Chu noted that the hospital was already reallocating resources because the Henry Ford hospitals in West Bloomfield and Detroit have reached capacity due to COVID-19 patients. “Today our capacity is quite full at those two hospitals — West Bloomfield and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit,” Chu said Wednesday. “We fortunately have the luxury right now of having additional capacity at some of our other campuses.” On Wednesday, Mary Macdonald, an Oakland County ER nurse, posted a viral video on Instagram detailing the harrowing conditions at southeast Michigan hospitals where medical staff are combating shortages of essential supplies and equipment to care for this surge of coronavirus patients. “It’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy,” Macdonald said. “From 10:00 PM last night to this morning, we intubated two of my patients within a half-hour. And upwards of 10 patients were put on ventilators. My patient took the last ventilator available in the hospital,” she said. “Normally, if a patient was to pass away, it would be because we tried everything that we could, we did everything that we could, we had all the resources and all the people that we needed to help save this patient’s life, and it was just their time. And now we aren’t giving the patient the time to choose whether it’s their time or not. We’re choosing for them,” she said. Macdonald also noted that the hospital is short of even basic supplies. “Resources are very slim. We have no medications to keep these patients even ventilated, let alone ventilators,” she said, adding that they are out of medications like propofol to keep people sedated when they are intubated. She said they are even running out of Tylenol. “There are no masks. There are no gowns. They’re running low on gloves because everyone has panicked and stockpiled this, so that medical staff doesn’t have it,” she said. Macdonald then showed the disposable N95 mask she was required to stow in a brown paper bag after every workday to be reused for the rest of the year. Macdonald urged her fellow Michiganders to take the social distancing instructions seriously in order to protect themselves and their neighbors from spreading the virus, otherwise the overwhelmed hospital system won’t be able to care for all the sick. “We don’t have any ventilators to put these patients on,” Macdonald stressed. “So, we’re going to start making life or death decisions in regards to people’s care. So you’re going to come in, and you’re going to get tagged whether you [are] deem[ed] necessary to even get intubated or are you being sent home to die. This is truly scary, and nobody is taking it seriously.”     Dear Family, Friends and Complete Strangers,  Please STAY HOME!! Love, an ER Nurse A post shared by  Mary Macdonald (@marymac019) on Mar 23, 2020 at 7:32pm PDT Khaldun, the chief medical office for Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services, said the state is “probably a few weeks out” from hitting a peak in coronavirus cases. Michigan reported nearly 2,900 cases by Thursday and 60 deaths, both an increase of Wednesday’s statewide numbers. Wayne County, home to Detroit, accounted for nearly half of the cases. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, called Wayne a “hot spot” nationally and said she was concerned the county was “having a more rapid increase.” Southeast Michigan, like New York City, is a hub for international travel. As the capital of the world’s auto industry, Metro Detroit has daily direct flights to and from major cities in Europe and Asia. Although the virus is hitting the entire metro area hard, the city of Detroit is uniquely vulnerable to the pandemic. Despite its dramatic economic rebound in recent years after its municipal bankruptcy in 2013, the city is still one of the poorest in the nation, with a poverty rate three times higher than the national average, and the city’s population suffers in greater numbers from underlining conditions like diabetes and heart disease. “Part of what we’re seeing in Detroit is that there’s such a high number of individuals who have those underlying conditions, who have diabetes and the heart disease, who may have obesity,” Khaldun explained. On Tuesday, Marlowe Stoudamire, 43, one of the young entrepreneurs involved in rebuilding the city, died from complications from COVID-19. According to health officials at Henry Ford Health System, Stoudamire had “no known underlying health conditions or recent travel.” Detroit’s police force has also been hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Two members of the force died this week due to COVID-19, and 331 Detroit officers and 70 civilian police employees have been quarantined since the outbreak The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blasted the bipartisan economic relief package passed by the House on Friday, declaring that there “should be shame for what was fought for in this bill.” “What did the Senate majority fight for?!” Ocasio-Cortez asked on the House floor prior to the passage of the measure. “One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful! The greed of that fight is wrong for crumbs for our families,” she said of the coronavirus relief measure, which the Senate passed unanimously on Wednesday. Ocasio-Cortez declared that the emergency relief bill, which provides $350 billion in forgivable loans for small businesses and features $1,200 payments for most U.S. adults, will only further the wealth gap. “The option that we have is to either let them suffer with nothing, or to allow this greed and billions of dollars which will be leveraged into trillions of dollars to contribute to the largest income inequality gap in our future,” she said. “There should be shame for what was fought for in this bill, and the choices we have to make,” she added: My mom works an hourly job.

"American “mainstream media” often act as apologists for China’s Communist Party, noted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), offering his remarks on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Alex Marlow while discussing the coronavirus outbreak. Marlow invited Cotton’s assessment of America’s news media “parroting Beijing propaganda” to their audiences “as if it’s true. “It’s very disappointing to see the number of mainstream media outlets that simply repeat Chinese ommunist propaganda,” replied Cotton, highlighting Chinese authorities’ claim of the coronavirus being a biological weapon deployed by the U.S. government. News media outlets such as CNN, MSNBC, and NBC — which all market themselves as politically objective and nonpartisan — forwarded China’s public relations measures, including the Chinese state’s unverifiable claims of the coronavirus’s spread within its borders. Many U.S. news media operations have praised China’s conduct in addressing the viral outbreak while framing President Donald Trump’s as incompetent and deceptive. Cotton said, “Our mainstream media wants to criticize Donald Trump or me or others for calling it ‘the China virus’ or ‘the Wuhan coronavirus’ when in fact [Chinese authorities] are the ones responsible.” LISTEN: 
Cotton continued, “It’s really disappointing. Now, there are some notable exceptions. Even some of the institutions that you and I hold in most disfavor do important work. I would recommend to your readers a great feature from New York Times last Sunday that visualizes the move of this virus from Wuhan across China and then across the world. It really kind of crystallizes what the Chinese Communist Party did, but too often our mainstream media outlets are apologists for the Chinese Communist Party, much like Walter Durante was for the Soviet Union back in the last century.” Blame for the coronavirus pandemic lies with the Chinese Communist Party, maintained Cotton.  “Occasionally on television, we see people laying blame on politicians for this virus,” Cotton stated. “Some folks on CNN want to blame Donald Trump.” America politicians are not to blame for the coronavirus, he added. “The virus is to blame, and the virus is the responsibility of the Chinese Communist Party for covering it up and not getting ahead of it in December and unleashing it on the world. The coronavirus pandemic provides an impetus for economic disengagement from China and renewal of American manufacturing of “critical goods,” Cotton determined. “There has to be a reckoning with China,” Cotton said. “We’ve got to stop our dependence on China, especially for critical goods. It’s one thing to have lawn furniture or toys made in China. It’s another thing to have our most basic and essential pharmaceuticals [made in China. Most Americans — until this virus hit — didn’t realize that we were totally dependent on China for things like antibiotics and penicillin, ibuprofen, [and] acetaminophen.” Cotton described legislative measures he is drafting to reduce American dependency on Chinese pharmaceutical and medical exports, including a mandate on federal agencies to purchase U.S.-made products to restore domestic production on such goods. “[My legislation] creates a market for U.S.-made pharmaceuticals by saying the federal government agency that purchases drugs — Medicare, Medicaid, the military, the VA, and others — can only buy American-made products,” explained Cotton. “It gives incentives to build that manufacturing capability here, [including] letting companies write off the expense of building a new factory … but then it also has the stick which says if you’re in China, you’re going to have to get out. Period.” “We have to bring back life-saving manufacturing from China,” concluded Cotton. “It’s going to have to be much broader than that, though. We can’t continue to depend on China for anything that is critical to our nation, that’s a terrible mistake we’ve made over the last 30 years. Most Americans realize it’s time to rectify that mistake.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

"President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act on Friday, an approximately $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package, at the White House. “I never signed anything with a ‘T’ on it,” Trump said, referring to the cost of the bill. The president signed just hours after the House passed the bill by voice vote, allowing members of Congress to remain away from Washington, DC, to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The legislation is approximately 880 pages long. “I want to thank Republicans and Democrats for putting their differences aside and putting America first,” Trump said. The president called for a massive relief package last week to help the economy survive the massive economic shutdown as a result of the coronavirus restrictions. The bill will give direct payments of up to $3,000 for a typical family of four for many Americans, offer small business loans to help maintain payroll, fund hospitals fighting the virus, provide expanded unemployment insurance, and offer major assistance for industries affected by the outbreak. “Things like this have never happened in our country,” Trump said.

"President Donald Trump signed a directive Friday ordering the Department of Health and Human Services to order General Motors to construct ventilators, utilizing the Defense Production Act. The president announced his decision in a statement sent to reporters, ordering “General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize Federal contracts for ventilators.” Trump said that negotiations with General Motors were productive but that the company was “wasting time.” “Today’s action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives,” he wrote. The order directs Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to use the authority under the Defense Production Act to require General Motors to move quickly to construct the ventilators. Earlier in the day, President Trump expressed his frustration with General Motors CEO Mary Barra. “As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday morning. The president noted that General Motors would construct 40,000 ventilators “very quickly” but cited reports that they had lowered their production number to 6,000. “Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar,” Trump wrote. “Always a mess with Mary B[arra].",Donald Trump Orders General Motors to Supply Ventilators Under Defense Production Act,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/donald-trump-orders-general-motors-to-supply-ventilators-under-defense-production-act/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump, Congress, and the entire federal government is focused on winning the battle against the coronavirus, but the New York Times is reporting on unnamed sources who claim the president’s efforts to lift regulations that have stifled American prosperity could spell trouble when the next pandemic comes along. The Times says the Trump administration’s efforts include “a restriction on scientific research that some doctors worry would complicate future pandemic controls,” but no link to documentation of that restriction is provided and no doctor is named or quoted. Other regulations the Times reports are underway to be reversed involve vehicle fuel efficiency standards, “which one person familiar with the plans said would be issued as early as next week.” Other regulations set to be undone include restrictions on coal plants and not including climate change in environmental reviews. The Times reports the Trump administration’s efforts are because the end of his presidency is in the offing: The aggressive timeline is aimed at shielding the policies from easy reversal if Democrats win the White House or control of the Senate in the 2020 election. While it is hardly unusual to see a push to finalize policies toward the end of an administration, several agency officials said they were surprised that political leaders had shown no sign of letting up amid the pandemic. A dozen federal workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about agency work, all described a relentless atmosphere at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department. Several people said they had been told to expect no “slippage” or relaxation of deadlines, although thousands of federal employees, like much of the nation, are working from home and juggling child care and work responsibilities. With an election looming, the urgency of completing regulations is real. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can overturn a regulation or federal rule within 60 days of it being finalized. If Democrats win control of the White House and Senate in November, and keep control of the House, any rule completed after late May or early June would be vulnerable. “The administration understands the electoral map has turned against it,” Richard L. Revesz, a professor of environmental law at New York University, said in the Times report. Officials at the EPA and the Interior Department are said to be “sensitive” to how the coronavirus outbreak affects business as usual, but “the administration remained focused on doing its job.” “We understand that Covid-19 has caused disruption in the lives of many Americans, but it is our duty to the American people to ensure we are continuing our work toward protecting human health and the environment,” Andrea Woods, an EPA spokeswoman, said in the Times report. The Times found a source to say the Trump administration is taking advantage of the health crisis to achieve its agenda. “The administration is essentially taking advantage of the fact that the public is distracted and in fact disabled from fully engaging against this ideological push,” claimed David J. Hayes, director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at the New York University School of Law, which fights for a leftist environmental agenda. The Times reports that the EPA is limiting “the types of scientific studies the agency can use” related to public health policies. But as Breitbart News reported, according to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, his agency is working to be more transparent than ever. “If we used a scientific study [to back actions the EPA takes] it has to be made available to the public,” Wheeler said at the American Conservative Union’s 2020 CPAC conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland in February. Wheeler said in announcing the launch: EPA has followed through on President Trump’s direction to streamline and improve the transparency of regulatory guidance issued by the agency. This new online database is a major milestone in government transparency.  Never before has the American public had access to all of the Agency’s guidance documents. This initiative spearheaded by President Trump will finally provide sunlight to agency decisions. “On October 9, 2019, President Trump issued Executive Order 13891, Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents, to promote transparency by ensuring that all active guidance documents are made available to the public,” the announcement said. The Times condemns the move toward transparency, saying, “The agency has argued that science used to make regulations requires greater transparency. But almost every major scientific group has opposed the rule because key fields of research (for example, linking air pollution to premature deaths or the studying consequences of pesticide exposure) rely on personal health information from subjects who agree to participate in studies only if their data is kept confidential.” The Times interviewed a doctor that speculated that this could be used to reject research related to the coronavirus. “There will be an enormous amount of clinical data that will be collected on Covid-19 that might be excluded,” Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, said in the Times report, citing patient privacy. Democrats argue that the rule should not be finalized during the pandemic, but Woods of the EPA disagrees. “She called fears that the proposed rule would impede the E.P.A.’s ability to respond to emergencies like the coronavirus ‘unfounded,’” the Times reported. “Our most important environmental statutes provide E.P.A. with authority to issue emergency orders or respond to address emergencies to protect human health and the environment,” Woods said, adding the science regulation “would not limit or impede E.P.A.’s authority to undertake such responses.” The Times said the Department of Interior wants to end some protections for migratory birds and needed time for more public input but Conner Swanson, a spokesman for the department, says the proposed regulation codified an agency legal opinion from December 2017 and that people had sufficient time for feedback. “The proposed rule was not a surprise to the public, as more than 46,000 comments were received on the proposal,” Swanson said.

"Dr. Cory Edgar, a physician at UConn Health, was arrested Thursday after police alleged he intentionally coughed on other medical employees. UConn police said Edgar was “deliberately coughing on and hugging nurses, causing them a substantial amount of alarm.” The act is said to have occurred in front of several witnesses. In addition to being a physician, Edgar serves as an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the UConn Musculoskeletal Institute. He was issued a misdemeanor breach of peace summons. He has been asked to appear in Hartford Community Court on June 3rd. UConn Health said it will launch an investigation into the alleged incident. UConn Health spokeswoman Jennifer Walker said in a statement: The involved doctor has confirmed that he is in excellent health and does not to his knowledge have COVID-19.

"The House passed a substantial emergency relief bill on Friday afternoon that would provide aid to the small businesses, hospitals, and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The House passed H.R. 748, the CARES Act, by voice vote. The legislation costs roughly $2 trillion and is approximately 880 pages long. The House vote follows as the Senate unanimously passed the legislation on Wednesday night, with 96 votes in favor of the bill and no senators opposed to the bill. The House became enflamed in controversy after Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) threatened to force a recorded vote on the coronavirus package. The backlash engendered frustration from lawmakers as well as President Donald Trump, who demanded that Republicans throw the Kentucky congressman out of office. “WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party!” Trump wrote on Twitter. When Massie tried to force a recorded vote on the legislation, the House overwhelmed the congressman and passed the coronavirus package. House lawmakers took up spots in the House public gallery to create more space between members of Congress while maintaining a quorum to prevent Massie from placing a recorded vote on the measure. Wow!Members are now taking up spots in the public gallery above the actual House floor. Staff are opening more doors for more members to go to the gallery above. Looks as if they’ll socially distance that way. And establish a quorum, defeating Massie. — Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) March 27, 2020  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) said on the floor before the vote: We answer with faith in ourselves and our abilities, faith in our free enterprise system, our amazing health care system, and yes, faith that when the chips are down Congress can come together with our President to help hard working families and businesses when they need it most. We answer the door at this crucial moment with faith in our Creator and faith in our great American spirit. This is the challenge of a lifetime. But if we keep pulling together, passing this bill without delay, we take another step toward that day when we answer the door and fear is no longer be there.” House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said before the vote that the bill represents Congress’s commitment to helping the country combat the pandemic. He said: This bill is not only a rescue package, it’s a commitment — a commitment that your government … and the people whom you elected to serve you … will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future. If you do your part, I promise: we will do ours. Madame Speaker — as I said earlier, it is our responsibility to act…to put aside our differences and to do what’s right for the American people. The legislation will move to the president’s desk to sign. Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"A draft letter by one of southeast Michigan’s major hospital systems was leaked online Thursday revealing the hospital’s policy to prioritize care for “patients who have the best chance of getting better” in the event of a shortage due to the coronavirus pandemic. The letter was drafted by officials at the Henry Ford Health System and is addressed to “our patients, families and community.” It outlines the criteria for which patients will be eligible for care if the hospital reaches capacity and is forced to ration limited resources. “Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care.” The letter explains the policy in the event of a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators: “If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition.” Some of the conditions that may make a person ineligible are listed as “severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; Terminal cancers; Severe trauma or burns.” A statement issued Thursday night by Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of Henry Ford Health System, confirmed the authenticity of the draft letter, but stressed that it reflects a “worst case scenario.” “With a pandemic of this nature, health systems must be prepared for a worst case scenario,” Munkarah said. “Gathering the collective wisdom from across our industry, we carefully crafted our policy to provide critical guidance to healthcare workers for making difficult patient care decisions during an unprecedented emergency.” He added, “These guidelines are deeply patient focused, intended to be honoring to patients and families. We shared our policy with our colleagues across Michigan to help others develop similar, compassionate approaches. It is our hope we never have to apply them and we will always do everything we can to care for our patients, utilizing every resource we have to make that happen.” As your trusted healthcare provider, our duty is to be prepared for worst case scenarios. Yesterday you may have seen an internal policy that has been circulated but not yet implemented. Here is our response: pic.twitter.com/W1orpUUJ5t — Henry Ford News (@HenryFordNews) March 27, 2020  The draft letter was leaked online Thursday when Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, tweeted out an image of the letter on what appeared to be official hospital letterhead. The full contents of the letter was printed by the Detroit Free Press (emphasis in original): To our patients, families and community: Please know that we care deeply about you and your family’s health and are doing our best to protect and serve you and our community. We currently have a public health emergency that is making our supply of some medical resources hard to find. Because of shortages, we will need to be careful with resources. Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care. What this means for you and your family: 1. Alert staff during triage of any current medical conditions or if you have a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) or other important medical information. 2. If you (or a family member) becomes ill and your medical doctor believes that you need extra care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Mechanical Ventilation (breathing machine) you will be assessed for eligibility based only on your specific condition. 3. Some patients will be extremely sick and very unlikely to survive their illness even with critical treatment. Treating these patients would take away resources for patients who might survive. 4. Patients who are not eligible for ICU or ventilator care will receive treatment for pain control and comfort measures. Some conditions that are likely to may [sic] make you not eligible include: 5. Patients who have ventilator or ICU care withdrawn will receive pain control and comfort measures. 6. Patients who are treated with a ventilator or ICU care may have these treatments stopped if they do not improve over time. If they do not improve this means that the patient has a poor chance of surviving the illness — even if the care was continued. This decision will be based on medical condition and likelihood of getting better. It will not be based on other reasons such as race, gender, health insurance status, ability to pay for care, sexual orientation, employment status or immigration status. All patients are evaluated for survival using the same measures. 7. If the treatment team has determined that you or your family members does not meet criteria to receive critical care or that ICU treatments will be stopped, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can ask for a review by a team of medical experts (a Clinical Review Committee evaluation.) Michigan has become an emerging hot spot for the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The state’s top health official, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, said hospitals in southeast Michigan are “at or near capacity.” The Henry Ford Health System is one of the major hospital providers in the Metro Detroit area, along with the William Beaumont Health System. Both providers have said they were caring for more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients at their 13 hospitals. Due to the sudden surge, operating rooms were being converted into intensive care units, and clinics had been turned into rooms for patients needing other medical care. On Wednesday, Beaumont Health said its hospitals were swamped with 650 patients who had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and more than 200 with tests pending. It said it would transfer more people to its hospital in Wayne County and get help from other health care providers. “The number of patients coming to our emergency rooms continues to grow rapidly,” Beaumont CEO John Fox said. Fox told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday that the pandemic is proving to be healthcare providers’ “worst nightmare,” noting that Beaumont is admitting 100 new coronavirus patients per day, at that time. “What we all need to remember is that we got our first patient two weeks ago. So this is coming on hard and fast. This is definitely a biological tsunami,” he said. “In my lifetime, we’ve never had a pandemic like this,” Fox said. “Across our system, we are facing limitations and nearing capacity with our staffing, personal protective equipment, and mechanical ventilators,” said Beaumont’s chief operating officer Carolyn Wilson. “The numbers are changing and increasing even in two-hour intervals,” said Bob Riney, the chief operating officer at Henry Ford, whose flagship hospital is in the city of Detroit. Dr. Betty Chu, the chief clinical officer and chief quality officer at Henry Ford, predicted an “upcoming surge.” Chu noted that the hospital was already reallocating resources because the Henry Ford hospitals in West Bloomfield and Detroit have reached capacity due to COVID-19 patients. “Today our capacity is quite full at those two hospitals — West Bloomfield and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit,” Chu said Wednesday. “We fortunately have the luxury right now of having additional capacity at some of our other campuses.” On Wednesday, Mary Macdonald, an Oakland County ER nurse, posted a viral video on Instagram detailing the harrowing conditions at southeast Michigan hospitals where medical staff are combating shortages of essential supplies and equipment to care for this surge of coronavirus patients. “It’s getting to the point now that it’s going to be just like Italy,” Macdonald said. “From 10:00 PM last night to this morning, we intubated two of my patients within a half-hour. And upwards of 10 patients were put on ventilators. My patient took the last ventilator available in the hospital,” she said. “Normally, if a patient was to pass away, it would be because we tried everything that we could, we did everything that we could, we had all the resources and all the people that we needed to help save this patient’s life, and it was just their time. And now we aren’t giving the patient the time to choose whether it’s their time or not. We’re choosing for them,” she said. Macdonald also noted that the hospital is short of even basic supplies. “Resources are very slim. We have no medications to keep these patients even ventilated, let alone ventilators,” she said, adding that they are out of medications like propofol to keep people sedated when they are intubated. She said they are even running out of Tylenol. “There are no masks. There are no gowns. They’re running low on gloves because everyone has panicked and stockpiled this, so that medical staff doesn’t have it,” she said. Macdonald then showed the disposable N95 mask she was required to stow in a brown paper bag after every workday to be reused for the rest of the year. Macdonald urged her fellow Michiganders to take the social distancing instructions seriously in order to protect themselves and their neighbors from spreading the virus, otherwise the overwhelmed hospital system won’t be able to care for all the sick. “We don’t have any ventilators to put these patients on,” Macdonald stressed. “So, we’re going to start making life or death decisions in regards to people’s care. So you’re going to come in, and you’re going to get tagged whether you [are] deem[ed] necessary to even get intubated or are you being sent home to die. This is truly scary, and nobody is taking it seriously.”     Dear Family, Friends and Complete Strangers,  Please STAY HOME!! Love, an ER Nurse A post shared by  Mary Macdonald (@marymac019) on Mar 23, 2020 at 7:32pm PDT Khaldun, the chief medical office for Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services, said the state is “probably a few weeks out” from hitting a peak in coronavirus cases. Michigan reported nearly 2,900 cases by Thursday and 60 deaths, both an increase of Wednesday’s statewide numbers. Wayne County, home to Detroit, accounted for nearly half of the cases. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, called Wayne a “hot spot” nationally and said she was concerned the county was “having a more rapid increase.” Southeast Michigan, like New York City, is a hub for international travel. As the capital of the world’s auto industry, Metro Detroit has daily direct flights to and from major cities in Europe and Asia. Although the virus is hitting the entire metro area hard, the city of Detroit is uniquely vulnerable to the pandemic. Despite its dramatic economic rebound in recent years after its municipal bankruptcy in 2013, the city is still one of the poorest in the nation, with a poverty rate nearly three times higher than the national average, and the city’s population suffers in greater numbers from underlining conditions like diabetes and heart disease. “Part of what we’re seeing in Detroit is that there’s such a high number of individuals who have those underlying conditions, who have diabetes and the heart disease, who may have obesity,” Khaldun explained. On Tuesday, Marlowe Stoudamire, 43, one of the young entrepreneurs involved in rebuilding the city, died from complications from COVID-19. According to health officials at Henry Ford Health System, Stoudamire had “no known underlying health conditions or recent travel.” Detroit’s police force has also been hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Two members of the force died this week due to COVID-19, and 331 Detroit officers and 70 civilian police employees have been quarantined since the outbreak, including Detroit police chief James Craig, who tested positive for coronavirus on Friday.

"For many, the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic outweighs the threat of the actual personal health impact of the virus itself. Addressing that concern was the goal of Congress, according to Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL), the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee. In an interview that aired on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Rogers laid out the aspects of the legislation, which lends aid to those adversely impacted by measures taken by government to limit the spread of the virus. For that, Rogers likened some of the elements of the bill to eminent domain, given the government was mandating that some private businesses cease operations in the name of public safety. “The whole point of this is to try to make people whole to the extent possible,” he explained. “The way I want your listeners to think of this is like eminent domain. You know, if the government comes in and says we’ve got to take your land to put an interstate highway through here, they then have an obligation to pay you the fair market value of the land they took from you. Well, what’s basically happened with a lot of these orders and state governments is you have to close your business down, and you can’t take in customers, whether it’s in your dental practice or in your restaurant.” “The government — in an effort to keep you safe has taken away your livelihood,” Rogers added. “And what we’re trying to do is give you fair compensation for that by offering these loan programs, which can turn into grants if, in fact, you adhere to the requirements.” Ultimately, Rogers said he expects to get through this rough patch, and before long, the economy would make a comeback. “I think there’s going to be so much pent-up desire to get out and do something, produce and spend that the economy is going to roar back by fall,” Rogers said. “For example, the travel industry — folks, after being cooped up in their house with this home restriction I think are going to be dying to go to the beach, and get on a plane and travel around the world,” he continued. “So, I think you’re going to see things really bounce back. I’m very confident of that.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",GOP Rep.

"President Donald Trump has authorized Defense Secretary Mark Esper to order units and individual members in the National Guard and Reserves, as well as “certain Individual Ready Reserve members,” to active duty to augment forces in the coronavirus response, according to the chief Pentagon spokesperson. “Today the President signed an Executive Order authorizing Secretary Esper to order units and individual members in the National Guard and Reserves and certain Individual Ready Reserve members, to active duty to augment forces for the effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,” said Jonathan Hoffman in a statement released late Friday evening. The statement said that decisions about which individuals may be activated are still being reviewed. “Generally, these members will be persons in Headquarters units and persons with high demand medical capabilities whose call-up would not adversely affect their civilian communities,” the statement said. The statement said the Defense Secretary and Department of Health and Human Services would consult with state officials before “any potential utilization” of National Guard Reserve Component units under the executive order. The statement said there is currently no projected number of expected activations, but the Pentagon can do so “as needed.” “As this is a dynamic situation, we do not currently have a projected number of expected activations, but the Department is now fully authorized to make activations as needed. We will provide updates as they become available,” Hoffman said. “The Department has been committed to using all our capabilities to confront the coronavirus outbreak, and the President’s action today ensures that we can bring select members of the Reserves and National Guard to the fight where needed most,” he said. Thousands of National Guard troops have been activated so far by state governors across the nation. They have been helping with coronavirus testing, delivering meals to homebound residents, helping build hospital spaces, and transporting equipment, and providing other logistical support. They have so far not played law enforcement roles, and under federal activation are barred from doing so. In recent days, the Army has reached out to retirees, particularly those with medical expertise, to help coronavirus response efforts. The Navy has also reached out to reservists with medical expertise who are not currently serving medical civilian capacities.

"Talk radio host Steve Gruber believes Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s actions related to coronavirus are about one thing: Being Joe Biden’s pick for vice president. On Monday, Whitmer issued a stay-at-home order in an attempt to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. “The current trajectory we’re on looks a lot like Italy,” she said in her announcement. “If we stay our current trajectory, just like Italy, over 70 percent of our people could get infected with Covid-19. Of that seven  million projected, about one million of those would be hospitalized,” she said. “If Gov. Whitmer truly believes there’s going to be one million Michiganders in the hospitals, why isn’t she building hospitals?” Gruber wondered to Breitbart News. He noted if Michigan follows Italy’s fatality rate of 9.5 percent, by Whitmer’s logic, 660,000 Michiganders will die. “Her numbers are reckless. Her intent is to be the savior,” Gruber said, adding the governor is attempting to cast herself as the hero when her predictions don’t come true. According to Gruber, Whitmer is not leading with solutions to the pandemic. “Anything Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine did, Michigan did 24 hours later,” he said. Plain and simple, “Whitmer is jockeying to be vice president of the United States” on a Joe Biden ticket, Gruber told Breitbart, which is spurring her “knee-jerk” reactions to Trump and his administration. On Thursday, Whitmer responded to a swipe by President Trump on Twitter. Hi, my name is Gretchen Whitmer, and that governor is me 👋 I've asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks, just PPEs, ventilators, N95 masks, test kits. You said you stand with Michigan — prove it. https://t.co/FtWlTLZdqW — Governor Gretchen Whitmer (@GovWhitmer) March 27, 2020  Trump said he’s having problems with “the young, a woman governor, you know who I’m taking about, from Michigan.” “I’ve asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it,” she wrote on Twitter. “No more political attacks, just (personal protective equipment), ventilators, N95 masks, test kits,” she said, adding, “You said you stand with Michigan — prove it.” Gruber believes it’s “entirely possible” that Whitmer is coordinating her responses with Biden’s campaign. Gruber doesn’t believe Whitmer has acted like any other of the Democrat governors, who are typically opposed to Trump. He noted New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has praised Trump after the federal government worked to help the state set up field hospitals. “I’m extremely grateful, and I want to repeat this, to President Trump, to FEMA, for making the field medical stations available to us,” Murphy said on Wednesday. “We all have heard New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo say this president is doing everything we have asked,” Gruber said. He noted Whitmer was selected to give the Democrat response to Trump’s State of the Union address. “The Democrats are desperate to win back three Midwest states they lost in 2016: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan,” Gruber said. “The Democrats scheduled their convention in Milwaukee. Biden claims his hometown is Scranton, Pennsylvania, and a vice presidential nominee from Michigan is the trifecta,” he said. That, according to Gruber, makes Whitmer the natural nominee to join a Biden ticket. “I wonder why others are so willing to believe the worst about the country, the future, and even worse about themselves and their neighbors,” Gruber wrote on his website. “I choose hope.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"President Donald Trump’s deputies announced Friday that they had begun the process of importing 85,000 H-1B gig workers to take white-collar jobs that will be needed after October by the millions of American graduates who are now losing jobs in the coronavirus crash. “This is just an unspeakable action,” said Marie Larson, a co-founder of the American Workers Coalition, which opposes the many visa worker programs that have transferred at least one million white-collar jobs to foreign workers. “I don’t believe President Trump ordered this — the swamp went ahead with this,” she said. “If the H-1B program is just for filling jobs that Americans cannot fill amid for labor shortages, then this would not be happening,” said John Miano, a lawyer with the Immigration Law Reform Institute. “But it is not a labor-shortage program — it is a cheap labor program to displace Americans,” he said. The 2020 lottery “is in your face that that is the purpose of the program.” The agency announced Friday that it had received enough corporate requests to snatch up all of the 2020 supply of H-1B visas. This annual supply includes 20,000 visas for foreigners who pay for graduate degrees at American colleges, plus 65,000 visas for graduates who are directly imported from India, China, and other countries. Non-profits — such as hospitals and universities — are allowed to also import an unlimited number of “cap-exempt” H-1Bs for white-collar jobs. Roughly 100,000 new H-1B workers arrive each year. But they are allowed to stay for many years, so companies have gradually built up a resident workforce of roughly 900,000 H-1B workers, alongside several hundred thousand additional white-collar workers carrying L-1, OPT, CPT, E-3, B-1, TN, H4EAD documents. The annual application and lottery process are managed by DHS’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] agency, which announced Friday afternoon: USCIS has received enough electronic registrations during the initial period to reach the FY 2021 H-1B numerical allocations (H-1B cap). We randomly selected from among the registrations properly submitted. We intend to notify petitioners with selected registrations no later than March 31, 2020, that they are eligible to file an H-1B cap-subject petition for the beneficiary named in the applicable selected registration. The work visas will not be sent to the lottery winners for several weeks after the companies submit petition packages with justifications for each visa. The deadline for submitting the petitions is June 30. Those justifications include a so-called “Labor Condition Application” document approved by the Department of Labor. The LCAs describe the intended job for each H-1B worker. Business advocates use the LCA process to claim that imported workers do not displace Americans. But the LCA process does not require the companies to show that Americans cannot be hired for the job. Also, the LCA documents are rubber-stamped by the department. A department spokesman told Breitbart News: Under current law, “[t]he Secretary of Labor shall review such an [LCA] application only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies” and, unless the application is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Department must certify the LCA within seven days of receiving the employer’s application. [Emphasis added.] Govt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc. The Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence. It is a huge economic & career loss for US college grads.#S368 #H1B https://t.co/pqEW9yJ89c — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 17, 2020  Trump’s deputies now know which companies asked for 2020 visas and how many visas they won in the lottery, said Larson. Those companies can tell Americans why they are hiring foreign workers when so many American graduates are jobless amid the coronavirus crash, she said: We want USCIS to name the companies that have won the lottery to bring in foreign workers for American jobs. What specific specific skills do these people have that American workers supposedly do not have? All Americans must demand that these companies make public why they need these people and why they could not hire American workers. We need the media to question each and every one of these companies to ask them why they could not hire Americans for these jobs. We need Americans to stand up during this massive unemployment — which is unprecedented even under the Great Depression and we have not hit the peak. This is a time for everyone to rise up. It is incumbent on President Trump to ensure that he keeps his [2016] campaign promise to put American workers first. One way he can do that is to ensure the American public gets the answer it deserves on why Americans are not getting these jobs. Trump’s failure to set curbs on the H-1B program has angered many of the swing-voting university graduates who supported him in 2016. In March 2016, after much zig-zagging, Trump declared: The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions. “The people surrounding President Trump don’t have his back — they are not helping him keep his campaign promise,” Larson said. In February 2020, a U.S. judge struck down the token H-1B curbs set by USCIS managers since Trump’s election. The current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for the NASSCOM outsourcing industry, which imports most of the H-1B gig workers. The group’s mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to extract salaries and wealth from the American college graduate class, and they split the gains among both countries’ executives and investors, plus the visa workers and India’s government. The public & GOP blocked the business push in Congress to keep 100K+ visa workers in US jobs.Next, biz asks agencies for the labor giveaway, with deceptive op-eds & earnest pleas from elite professional trade associations.OK, so who lobbies back?#H1Bhttps://t.co/OUxZcq1gYU — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 26, 2020  Some of the H-1B workers are experts hired by elite software and banking companies. But many of the H-1B visa workers are hired by Indian-run staffing companies to quickly fill open slots in a wide variety of Fortune 500 companies. For example, many of the contract jobs are in technology, accounting, health care, design, banking, finance, engineering, science, teaching, and insurance, and even in the fashion industry. The companies include Tata, Infosys, HCL, and Tech Mahindra. The little-publicized outsourcing industry boosts investors’ stock prices by cutting salaries for millions of American graduates. It also pushes many older American professionals out of jobs and prevents millions of American graduates from getting on the first rung of their career ladders. The H-1Bs and staffing companies are often used by American executives and hiring managers out of sheer laziness, insiders tell Breitbart News. The gig workers provided by the staffing companies are often unskilled, unproductive, and expensive, said a former executive assistant at a banking company who helped managers replace many American professionals with Indian H-1Bs. But they are compliant because the jobs pay far more than Indian or Chinese jobs and because they hope to win green cards, she said. American executives do not want to go to the trouble of hiring and managing independent and innovative American professionals — but do want to promise short-term cost savings during their periodic calls with Wall Street investors, she said. “It was not about [workers’] skills, not about anything else, it was about money,” she said. “They want credit for saving the company money, so they won’t look at anything that goes against the [cost saving] narrative.” Multiple lawsuits and testimony from Americans show how the H-1B program undermines professionalism, innovation, and Americans’ careers. The 2020 lottery was applauded by immigration lawyers who import H-1B workers for business groups. “I’ll keep you posted on when I start seeing updates for my registrations!” an immigration lawyer told her clients. “Yes, we had a substantial increase in submissions compared to last year,” she told one questioner. “NewsFlash! H1B Registration Cap Hit, USCIS to Post Results by March 31st,” said a post by the Murthy Law Firm, which has offices in Indian, Seattle, and Maryland. NewsFlash!

The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate. In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher. Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.

"President Donald Trump again criticized Democrat Michigan Governor Gretchen Witmer on Friday for complaining about the federal government’s efforts for her state in fighting the spread of the coronavirus. “I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude!” Whitmer appeared again on CNN on Friday evening as she continues to criticize President Trump. “This patchwork of laws based on who the governors are really isn’t the best strategy going forward,” she said. “And I think we all need to lock arms and not fight one another but fight Covid-19.” Witmer also claimed Friday that venders were specifically told by the federal government not to send supplies to Michigan. “What I’ve gotten back is that vendors with whom we had contracts are now being told not to send stuff here to Michigan,” she said in a radio interview. “It’s really concerning.” Witmer did not provide any evidence of her claim. Trump criticized Whitmer and Washington Governor Jay Inslee for repeatedly complaining about the administration’s handling of the fight against the virus. “I think they should be appreciative, because you know what? When they are not appreciative to me, they are not appreciative to the Army Corps, they are not appreciative to FEMA,” he said during a press conference on Friday. “It’s not right.” He singled out Whitmer for failing her state. “All she does is – she has no idea what is going on – and all she does is say it’s the federal government’s fault,” Trump said. He said that Vice President Mike Pence continued to reach out to Inslee and Whitmer, even though he told him to ignore them. “No, you know what I say:  if they don’t treat you right, I don’t call,” Trump said. “He’s a different type of person. He will call quietly anyway.” Trump said that despite his clashes with the two governors, it made “no difference” about what happened in their states.",Donald Trump Dubs Michigan Governor Gretchen ‘Half’ Whitmer,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/donald-trump-dubs-michigan-governor-gretchen-half-whitmer/,Breitbart

"Friday on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed she completely turned around the original bill Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) presented for a coronavirus bill stimulus package. Maddow asked, “In terms of the president’s personal actions and his personal decisions, I was struck by the fact he issued a signing statement when he signed this bill today saying that he would o the provision of this bill that lays out some oversight and the establishment of the inspector general to make sure that some of the business bailout provisions in the bill aren’t misused. The president is saying today that he has no interest in that oversight, and he’ll override that. What’s your reaction to that?” Pelosi said, “Well, of course, it’s not a surprise to anyone, but Congress will exercise its oversight. We will have our panel of House —appointed by the House in realtime to make sure we know where those funds are being expended.” She added, “Let me say that the president’s statement is indicative of the difference between Democrats and Republicans when it came to this bill. The bill that was put on the floor last Saturday by Senator McConnell was a corporation, corporate down bill, trickle-down, as usual. What it turned into was a bubble up workers-first legislation, workers, and families first. They never thought they would be supporting the provisions that are in the bill that related to unemployment insurance and how it’s expanded in so many ways, all that we would be doing for small businesses, that there would be provisions that would be helpful to families in terms of access to health care and the rest. The bill was jiu-jitsu. We took the bill and turned it around. So they signed it in the White House as if they had some real provenance as to what was in the bill. They knew the bill was needed, and again, we put our conditions on any assistance that was going to industries in our country because we wanted to make sure that workers came first and they did in the bill.

"President Donald Trump is telling General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra to reopen the automaker’s idled Lordstown, Ohio, plant to make ventilators for Americans in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis. During a press briefing on Friday, Trump blasted GM for decades of offshoring American jobs to foreign countries and idling its Lordstown plant last year that immediately left 1,600 GM workers laid off and thousands more in supporting industries. Trump called on GM’s Mary Barra to reopen its Lordstown plant — which was sold in November 2019 to Workhorse Group Inc. — to make ventilators for American hospitals and patients. GM has been rumored to be opening a Lordstown plant to manufacture electric cars. Trump said: I wasn’t happy where General Motors built plants in other locations over the years. Not so much during my term, but they built a lot of plants in other countries. I won’t name the countries, but you can imagine, so I didn’t go into it with a very favorable view. I was extremely unhappy with Lordstown, Ohio, where they left Lordstown, Ohio, in the middle of an auto boom because we had 17 car companies coming in and then they were leaving one plant in Ohio. [Emphasis added] I love Ohio, and what happens? That became the story — not that all these plants are moving in, but that you had one plant and they were leaving. And frankly, I think [Lordstown] would be a good place to build the ventilators, but we’ll see. We’ll see how that all works out. I wasn’t too thrilled. I thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators, and all of a sudden it became [6,000] and price became a big object. [Emphasis added] Trump’s blasting of GM for failing to immediately ramp up production of ventilators comes as he invoked the Defense Production Act to mandate multinational corporations with plants in the U.S. to produce and manufacture needed medical supplies and equipment. “We’re engaged in the most central mobilization since World War II,” trade adviser Peter Navarro said. “We have a wartime president fighting an invisible enemy.” “All around this country, as this virus bears down, the ventilators are the most important thing for patients who become seriously ill. They are literally the lifeline for people,” Navarro said. As part of an effort to close more American manufacturing plants, GM’s Mary Barra closed the Lordstown plant last year and began shuttering the Warren Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, as well as laying off about 800 American workers at its Detroit Hamtramck Assembly plant. American manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy as every one manufacturing job supports an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries. Decades of free trade, with deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have eliminated nearly five million manufacturing jobs from the American economy and resulted in the closure of about 50,000 manufacturing plants.

"Joe Biden’s campaign exponentially increased payments to a public relations firm after a #MeToo advocacy group founded by one of the firm’s partners began considering an allegation against the former vice president. Federal Election Commission filings indicate Biden’s campaign paid SKDKinckerbocker more than $806,000 in the first two months of this year. The money, supposedly used for direct mail fundraising, dwarfed what the public relations firm was paid the year prior. More troubling is that the payments came as the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, founded by SKDKnickerbocker partner Hilary Rosen, was weighing if it would offer legal assistance to Tara Reade, a former Biden staffer. In January, Reade approached Time’s Up in hopes of receiving help in dealing with the fallout generated by her own #MeToo story involving a powerful man. The previous April, Reade had come forward to accuse the former vice president of inappropriate touching while working in his Senate office during the early 1990s. The allegations, which were reported to a local Nevada newspaper, had resulted in Reade being attacked by journalists and media personalities for an old Medium piece she had penned praising Russia and Vladimir Putin. Whether intended or not, the revelations about Reade’s pro-Russian sentiments ensured that most media outlets paid little attention to her allegations. Given how poorly that first attempt had gone, Reade was hoping that Time’s Up could not only help renew interest in her story, but also provide financial assistance for any suit against Biden or her online “harassers. In that regard, Reade had some cause for optimism. Shortly after reaching out to Time’s Up, she spoke to a program director at the National Women’s Law Center, which house’s the group legal defense fund. The initial talks seemed to go well, with the director informing Reade that since there was contemporaneous evidence about her allegation—she had informed a friend about the incident when it happened—she was likely to qualify for assistance. Despite those early positive signs, Reade soon learned the organization would, in fact, not be able to help. The reasoning, she learned, was because Time’s Up would be putting its status as a 501(c)3 nonprofit in jeopardy. Sharyn Tejani, the group’s director, claimed that since Biden was running for president, any effort on Reade’s behalf would be in violation of laws prohibiting 501(c)3’s from intervening in political campaigns. The group’s interpretation of the law, though, struck many as overly stringent, with a top campaign finance expert telling Breitbart News it raised questions if Time’s Up had a conflict of interest between its mission and its politics. “If they is an advocacy group that publicizes incidents of sexual harassment, their failure to publicize this one is likely more problematic, as they appear to be making a decision to protect a prominent political candidate,” said Celta Mitchell, a partner at Foley & Lardner LLP. While all of this was out between Reade and Time’s Up, the Biden campaign’s relationship with SKDKnickerbocker was taking on a new dimension. At the beginning of January, the campaign paid the public relations firm more than $218,000 for its direct mail fundraising services. Normally, such a large payment would not have raised much attention. After all, one of SKDKnickerbocker’s managing directors, Anita Dunn, was a top adviser on the Biden campaign. It does stand out, however, if only for the sheer disparity in payments. In December, the firm was paid only $7,345 for its direct mail services. One month later, the campaign upped that sum by 30 times, shelling out $218,693 for SKDKnickerbocker’s help with direct mail. The payments did not stop there. At the end of January, Biden’s campaign paid the firm another $329,000 for its services, in three separate installments. This was followed up by futher payment for more than $257,000 at the end of February. Overall, between January 1 and February 29, Biden’s campaign paid SKDKnickerbocker more than $806,000. In comparison, between June and December 2019, the firm was paid a little over $75,000. The reason for increases remain unclear. The connection between the two entities and the Biden campaign comes as Reade is leveling a new sexual assault allegation against the former vice president. Earlier this week, Reade accused Biden of pushing her up against a wall, kissing her, and digitally penetrating her sometime in 1993, while she was in his employ. Reade did not mention that alleged incident when coming forward last April. It is uncertain if she attempted to broach the new allegations with Time’s Up when first making contact with the group.",Joe Biden’s Campaign Paid $806K to PR Firm Tied to New #MeToo Allegation,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/27/joe-bidens-campaign-paid-806k-to-pr-firm-tied-to-new-metoo-allegation/,Breitbart
"Illegal aliens are demanding they too receive $1,200 in federal checks from the government as part of a Chinese coronavirus crisis relief package. Open borders organizations like the George Soros-funded United We Dream, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the National Immigration Law Center — all of which represent the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the United States — are pleading with the federal government to cut federal checks to illegal aliens who have Individual Tax Identification Number (ITINs). Currently, Trump’s coronavirus relief package includes $1,200 federal checks for American citizens with Social Security Numbers (SSN) or those considered “resident aliens,” like permanent lawful residents in the U.S. on green cards. Illegal aliens, therefore, are excluded from receiving the federal checks, a provision that has outraged the open borders lobby. “Everyone, regardless of immigration status, must have access to testing, medical care & financial relief. Congress must ensure that all Americans can focus on keeping their families & communities safe & healthy,” officials with the National Immigrant Justice Center posted online.

Today, there are anywhere from 7.8 to 8.1 million illegal aliens working illegally in the U.S. economy — primarily holding jobs that would have otherwise gone to working-class Americans.

"States that introduced “green” regulations that taxed single-use plastic grocery bags in an effort to eventually annihilate them are now welcoming them back as health officials caution of possible contamination with reusable bags. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) said Thursday he was suspending the ten-cent tax on single-use plastic bags at grocery stores and other retail businesses as one of his actions “to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.” “The latter move is to curb the use of personal bags that could bring the virus into a store,” reported the Journal Inquirer. Neighboring Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) banned reusable bags in stores this week and lifted bans on plastic bags as well “as part of his administration’s latest steps to limit the spread of the coronavirus,” reported the Boston Business Journal. “Baker announced Wednesday that stores cannot charge for either paper or plastic bags, which in some communities have previously cost 5 cents per bag,” noted the report.  New York State and Maine will also delay enforcement of their bans on single-use plastic bags. In New York, a lawsuit challenging the ban on plastic bags has also been delayed because of the coronavirus crisis. Basil Seggos, commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, disagreed with a postponement of the plastic bag ban and tweeted: No. Folks, if you are concerned about the cleanliness of your reusable bag, please consider washing it— as you wash clothes or hands. It’s good hygiene anyway. New Yorkers are pleased with the bag ban and have no interest in a return to polluting ways. — Basil Seggos (@BasilSeggos) March 12, 2020  New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) issued an order Saturday banning reusable bags at stores, asserting they pose a risk of spreading the coronavirus: In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through grocery sales, and to promote and secure the safety and protection of the people of New Hampshire … all grocery stores … and any other establishment within this State offering groceries for sale, shall transition to exclusive use of store provided single use plastic or paper bags when bagging groceries or other products for customers. A report at New Hampshire’s Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy asserted that, as many states forged ahead with plastic bag bans, “concerns about public health tended to be dismissed, even though studies have shown genuine potential health hazards.” In June 2018, for example, researchers at Loma Linda University School of Public Health studied the possible transmission of norovirus through reusable grocery bags (RGBs) at the supermarket. After inoculating RGBs with a surrogate virus to evaluate how the pathogens traveled within a grocery store, researchers found the surrogate virus “spread to all surfaces touched by the shopper; the highest concentration occurred on the shopper’s hands, the checkout stand, and the clerk’s hands.” The authors concluded the high concentration of the virus warrants public education about washing RGBs between use. Yet, many people simply empty them of groceries and meats and then replace them immediately in their cars so as not to be without them for their next shopping trip. The Josiah Bartlett Center reported: A now widely reported University of Arizona study from 2011 found so much bacteria in reusable grocery bags that the study’s lead author called reusable bags “a serious threat to public health, especially from coliform bacteria including E. coli, which were detected in half of the bags sampled.” When bags contaminated by meat juices sat in cars for two hours, the number of bacteria increased ten-fold. The study’s author warned that “consumers are alarmingly unaware of these risks and the critical need to sanitize their bags on a weekly basis.” Andrew Cline, Josiah Bartlett Center’s executive director, told Michael Graham, political editor at InsideSources.com: Ill-conceived bans on disposable containers such as plastic shopping bags, water bottles, to-go cups and straws need to be reconsidered along with the many other unnecessary and potentially dangerous regulations this outbreak is exposing. Research clearly shows that poorly handled reusable shopping bags are like little Ubers for dangerous micro-organisms. Governor Sununu deserves credit for taking this public health risk seriously when other state and local elected officials would not. At the Daily Signal, Jarrett Stepman also pointed to a study published at the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management that found plastic bag bans actually do not significantly reduce waste. Similarly, Just Facts produced a video in August demonstrating that plastic bags are actually better for the environment than paper and reusable bags. “The bottom line is, the current crisis has revealed the misguided nature of plastic bag bans, and now cities and states must move quickly to prevent these bans from exacerbating the coronavirus pandemic,” Stepman observed.",States Welcome Back Single-Use Plastic Bags to Avoid Contamination,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/states-welcome-back-single-use-plastic-bags-to-avoid-contamination/,Breitbart
"Former Vice President Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination, is facing a new sexual assault allegation from a former congressional staffer. Tara Reade, who came forward last year to accuse Biden have inappropriately touched her in the 1990s, revealed earlier this week during an interview on the podcast of New York City blogger Katie Halper that there was more to the story. According to Reade, while working as a staff assistant in Biden’s Senate office in 1993, she was asked by one of her colleagues to deliver a “gym bag” to the senator. When Reade caught up with Biden, she alleges, he pressed up against a wall and proceeded to kiss her. “It happened all at once, and then… his hands were on me and underneath my clothes,” Reade told Halper, elaborating on the alleged assault in detail. And then he went down my skirt and then up inside it. And he penetrated me with his fingers, whatever. And he was kissing me at the same time and he was saying something to me. He said several things and I can’t remember everything [that] he said. I remember a couple of things. I remember his saying, first, like as he was doing it, ‘Do you want to go somewhere else?’ and then him saying to me, when I pulled away, he got finished doing what he was doing and I, how I was pulled back and he said, ‘Come on man, I heard you liked me.’ That phrase stayed with me because I kept thinking what I might have said. And I can’t remember exactly if he said ‘I thought’ or if ‘I heard.’ It’s like he implied that I had done this. “For me, everything shattered in that moment,” she added. “He wasn’t trying to do anything more. But I looked up to him. He was my father’s age. He was this champion of women’s rights in my eyes and I couldn’t believe it was happening.” Reade said the purported assault took place in either the U.S. Capitol or the Russell Senate Office Building–where Biden’s office was located at the time. Her inability to recollect the exact time and place of the supposed assault was the result of decades of having “worked so hard not to remember it anymore.” Although there are no direct witnesses to the alleged assault, Reade claims that she told a close friend, as well as her brother, about the incident at the time it occurred. 
Last April, Reade was one of eight women to come forward and accuse Biden of unwanted touching after similar allegations were made by Lucy Flores, a one-time candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada. That initial attempt to tell her story, however, had gone poorly, with some reporters and media personalities using an old Medium piece Reade penned praising Russia and Vladimir Putin to dismiss the allegations outright. At the time, Reade did not allege that she was digitally penetrated by Biden while in his employ. Reade did, however, attempt to share her full story earlier this year by contacting a prominent #MeToo group, Time’s Up. Read hoped the group could not only publicize the allegations, but also provide financial assistance for any legal suit, either against the former vice president or her online “harassers.” Time’s Up and its affiliated legal defense fund turned down those entreaties, arguing their nonprofit status could be in jeopardy by taking on a candidate for the presidency. A prominent campaign finance expert told Breitbart News earlier this week that reasoning was inaccurate and seemed to imply Time’s Up was protecting a “prominent political candidate.” On Friday, Biden’s campaign publicly denied there was any truth to Reade’s accusation. “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims,” Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president’s deputy campaign manager, told Fox News. “We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.” Bedingfield’s comments, though, stand in stark contrast to those Biden, himself, made at the height of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. “For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it’s been made worse or better over time,” Biden said in November 2018.",Joe Biden Faces New Sexual Assault Allegation from Former Staffer,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/27/joe-biden-faces-new-sexual-assault-allegation-from-former-staffer/,Breitbart
"Friday on MSNBC, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said President Donald Trump was worrying about which governors are “appeasing” him instead of working for the American public on the coronavirus pandemic. Anchor Ari Melber asked, “I’m curious, your response to what we just heard in the briefing room. Both the president’s response, which included touting his own work, attacking some governors, mostly Democrats, talking about the return to normalcy as well as what we heard from the medical experts?”
Omar said, “It’s a huge contrast really when you get a moment to hear from the experts. You know, we were just listening to the doctors talk about how this is unprecedented that many of the pandemics that they’ve dealt with, this supersedes that. Then you hear the president sort of say this is nothing, like the flu. You know this is nothing more than the flu. Many more people die every year from the flu. So that kind of contrast really is quite alarming. It sort of shows you how much this president really isn’t taking the time to hear what the experts are telling him and isn’t being honest with the public.” She continued, “I recently read In the 1918 flu pandemic, one of the greatest lessons that was learned is you have to tell the truth. The public needs to know what is actually happening and how best they should prepare themselves to be able to safeguard their lives and livelihoods.” She added, “When we have a president who can not really stay honest for a moment without worrying about who is appeasing him, who is talking about the great work he’s doing and not just doing the work of the American people he was elected to serve really is dangerous and irresponsible.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","Ilhan Omar: Trump Is ‘Worrying About Who Is Appeasing Him,’ Not Doing the Work on Coronavirus",2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/27/ilhan-omar-trump-is-worrying-about-who-is-appeasing-him-not-doing-the-work-on-coronavirus/,Breitbart

"Businessmen, lawmakers, and health experts have lauded President Donald Trump’s expansion of telehealth for Medicare patients as “life-changing.” The reform has given Americans better access to care and improved doctor transparency efficiency. President Trump has worked to expand telehealth since the beginning of his administration. Trump expanded telehealth options at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Then-VA Secretary David Shulkin said that Trump moved to expand video technology and diagnostic tools to conduct medical exams. He said that veterans will be able to use mobile devices to schedule or cancel appointments with a VA doctor. Shulkin said that the programs will make it possible to provide medical care to veterans across the world. In March, the Trump administration expanded Medicare telehealth coverage that will enable beneficiaries to receive a wider range of healthcare services from their doctors. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved a waiver that temporarily pays clinicians to provide telehealth services for beneficiaries across the country. President Trump also signed a coronavirus-related bill in March that would provide $500 million to help clinicians expand telehealth services. Before the Trump administration, Medicare was only allowed to pay clinicians for telehealth services such as routine visits in limited circumstances. The Trump telehealth expansion has been lauded by senators, businessmen, and members of his administration. “We need to clear out as many regulatory barriers standing in the way of access to telemedicine as possible,” Blackburn said in March. CMS Administrator Seema Verma told Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow recently that the telehealth reform expands access to health care and helps prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Verma explained: It is rapidly expanding across the country under the president’s leadership. One of the things that we know right now is that it’s better for people to stay at home. Those are the recommendations the president and the vice president have put out, 15 days to slow the spread. We’ve said very clearly to individuals, especially those that are elderly with underlying health conditions, that you need to stay home. And so that’s why we’re using telehealth and promoting telehealth because we know that people still need health care. It may be completely unrelated to the coronavirus, you may have heart disease and diabetes, it allows people to communicate with their doctors from the safety of their own home, which is so important.  Clint Phillips, the CEO of Medici, a telehealth company, told Breitbart News in an interview on Friday that the reform has improved doctor’s efficiency and improved Americans’ access to their doctor. Phillips said, “This is a great way for their patients to do everything, and they can probably help 80 to 90 percent of their patients. Instead of dozens of doctors utilizing this every day, we’ve now seen hundreds of doctors, maybe thousands of doctors, that are realizing the impact that they could have on their patients, but also the flexibility that it gives them to work from home, work wherever they are. They, like other professionals, they could work from a Starbucks.” Phillips said that, with telehealth, doctors could increase the number of patients they see. “We’re definitely seeing that they’re using our application is huge. Our doctors’ visits are doubling; I think one of our doctors is doing two hundred and fifty consults this week, virtually,” he said.  The telehealth CEO noted that Medici is “text-centric,” meaning that doctors can communicate to patients through the Medici platform to easily refill prescriptions and other meetings that would not require an in-person appointment.  Further, with applications such as Medici, doctors can speak to patients even if they both do not speak the same language, as Medici offers translation services. “A doctor could receive messages in Spanish, reading it in English, and their patient is getting the response in perfect Spanish. And we do 100 languages,” Phillips said. Phillips also said the Trump administration should make the policy permanent, calling the reform a blessing for patients and doctors. He said, “Yes, I think it’s a great policy, so I absolutely applaud the expansion of telemedicine for Medicare.” “Wonderful opportunity for doctors, it’s a wonderful opportunity for Medicare. We’ve got doctors that use it for Medicare, and we can tell you it is life-changing,” the Medici CEO emphasized. Phillips also said that the Trump reform represents a success that other presidential administrations have only teased before. During former President Barack Obama’s 2011 State of the Union Adress, he teased that with greater access to broadband Internet, more patients could video chat with their doctors. Obama said that broadband is about “a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.” Phillips said that Trump had accomplished something that other administrations could not. “They mentioned these, but there was never any action to do it, so I think that this administration already started to move the needle forward with VA before this happened,” Phillips said.

"Detroit’s top law enforcement officer, James Craig, tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus, according to an announcement Friday afternoon. The announcement was made by Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan during a news conference discussing the city’s response to the coronavirus, which includes a new testing facility. “Chief James Craig, this morning, tested positive for COVID-19,” Duggan said. “It’s something that we knew was a possibility. He is very fit. He’s got mild symptoms. And he is very much in charge of running this department. I think I’ve talked to him ten times today. But he’s not going to be back on site until he fully recovers.” Duggan also announced during the news conference that Assistant Chief James White will assume day-to-day operations of the department, with White stating that he will stay in close communications with Craig as the coronavirus pandemic further unfolds. The Detroit Police Department previously announced the deaths of a 911 call taker and homicide Capt. Jonathan Parnell, both of whom officials claimed had tested positive for the coronavirus. On Thursday, a draft letter from Henry Ford Health System, one of southeast Michigan’s major hospital systems, was leaked online and revealed the hospital’s policy to prioritize “patients who have the best chance of getting better” in the event of a shortage due to the coronavirus pandemic, as reported by Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour. “Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority. Patients will be evaluated for the best plan of care and dying patients will be provided comfort care,” the letter stated. Some of the conditions that would make a person ineligible for an ICU bed or a ventilator include “severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; Terminal cancers; Severe trauma or burns.” According to the state’s top health official, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, hospitals in southeast Michigan are “at or near capacity.” William Beaumont Health System, another major hospital provider in the Metro Detroit area, said Wednesday its hospitals were swamped with 650 patients who had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and more than 200 with tests pending. “The number of patients coming to our emergency rooms continues to grow rapidly,” Beaumont CEO John Fox said. As of Friday at 3 p.m., there were 3,657 total confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Michigan with 92 deaths, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

"President Donald Trump sent a message to kids at home regarding the coronavirus on Friday, during a press conference at the White House. “I would say that you are a citizen of the greatest country anywhere in the world, and we were attacked,” Trump said. The president was asked by a reporter for a message to kids who were stuck at home from school. “I would say that they have a duty to sit back, watch, behave, wash their hands, stay in the apartment with mom and dad … and just learn from it,” Trump said. Trump admitted that some of the students were probably happy to be at home. “Some of them are very happy not to go to school,” he said. “Again, they should just sit back and be very proud of our country, because we’re doing it for them.” Trump said that he was pleased that the young people were not as affected by the coronavirus. “The young people are really attacked at a much lesser extent,” he said, adding, “The children do very well.”",Donald Trump Message to Kids: ‘You Are a Citizen of the Greatest Country in the World’,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/donald-trump-message-to-kids-you-are-a-citizen-of-the-greatest-country-in-the-world/,Breitbart
"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, New York state is mobilizing to build eight temporary hospitals to care for the surge of patients, including a 1,000-bed makeshift hospital at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan built with the help of the New York National Guard and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. New York has emerged as the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States with more than 46,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases state-wide, of which more than 25,000 are from New York City. Those numbers amount to a 7,300 increase in confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In total, 603 New Yorkers have died from the virus as of Friday evening. On Friday, there were 6,481 patients hospitalized in New York state, an increase of 20 percent from the numbers the day before and double what it had been three days earlier. Of those patients, 1,583 were in intensive care and over 2,000 had been discharged, the New York Times reports. The Times also reports, that over “62,000 medical workers, many of them retired, have volunteered to help stem the crisis. Almost 10,100 mental health professionals have also stepped forward to treat New Yorkers coping with the effects of being isolated.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for 4,000 more temporary beds across New York City, where the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has already been converted into a hospital. New York Gov.

Cuomo said he was going to ask the White House to grant the request to build those additional resources. Cuomo reiterated the state’s goal to get to 140,000 hospital bed capacity from the current 53,000 available. He said that hospitalizations are increasing at a rate at which they double every four days, compared with three days last week. He said he believed there was a correlation between social distancing measures and the improved rate. The U.S. has surpassed 101,000 confirmed cases on Friday, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. As of Friday afternoon, there were over 1,581 deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Dr. John Brooks of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic and that all corners of the country were at risk. “There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,” he said. In addition to New York, states like California, Washington, Michigan, and Louisiana have emerged as emerging hot spots for the pandemic of the virus that originated in Wuhan, China.

"President Donald Trump said Friday he has no plans to suspend import tariffs. “They’re not even talking to me about it,” Trump said. “More Fake News.” Trump was asked about suspending tariffs during the daily coronavirus briefing on Friday afternoon. A few minutes earlier the Wall Street Journal reported that a senior administration official had said that customs duties would be suspended for three months. Trump said that China had not requested a suspension of the tariffs. “Everybody keeps saying, ‘Are you going to suspend the tariffs?’ Well, the answer is no,” Trump said. “President Xi never even brought it up last night. It wasn’t discussed. It’s fake news. Tell the Wall Street Journal.” The Wall Street Journal‘s report noted that it “wasn’t immediately known when the suspension would be announced, and trade experts cautioned that President Trump could still overrule the plans.” Pressure for tariff reduction has come from big U.S. importers attempting to take advantage of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. Many of those same companies will already be receiving large aid packages from the U.S. government and trade hawks point out that there’s no reason companies that have outsourced production of items they sell to American consumers should get additional relief. A coronavirus tariff reduction would mean companies importing goods from China would get more relief than a company sourcing from Mexico or inside the U.S. Companies that moved production out of China to avoid the tariffs would, in effect, be penalized.  ",Trump Calls Tariff Suspension ‘More Fake News’,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/27/trump-calls-tariff-suspension-fake-news/,Breitbart
"Elaine Parker of Job Creators writes in Fox Business about how the legislative stimulus package passed on Friday helps small business – the backbone of the U.S. economy, employing nearly half the country’s workforce – with $349 billion in forgivable small business loans: On Friday, the House of Representatives passed the CARES Act—a legislative package intended to soften the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation is particularly beneficial to small businesses, which are in dire need of a lifeline amid the pandemic. President Trump is expected to sign the bill imminently. . . . A number of provisions in the CARES Act aim to help struggling businesses and their employees who are laid off out of necessity. But perhaps the most helpful is the $349 billion in forgivable small business loans. The funds—coordinated by the Small Businesses Administration, but distributed through private banks—will give entrepreneurs much needed cash to keep payroll flowing, as well as cover rent, utilities and other overhead. Most importantly, it will keep small businesses primed to reopen fully once the public health crisis subsides. Getting the economy moving at full-steam-ahead quickly will be critical in order to repel a lasting economic downturn. It’s not a bailout, but a strategy to extend the strong economy previously enjoyed by Americans to the post-coronavirus era.

"Iran is capable of helping the American people fight the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, but the Islamic Republic does not require any assistance from the United States, according to statements by Major General Hossein Salami, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Thursday. The IRGC is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Iran is considered the nation most devastated by the global Chinese coronavirus outbreak and, if dissident estimates on the number of dead are true, the nation with the world’s largest death toll. Salami’s remarks come in reaction to recent announcements by U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, that Washington was ready to provide assistance to Tehran in fighting the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. “When Americans say they want to help the Iranian nation under these conditions, it is nothing but demagogy. They are themselves plagued by this virus outbreak and their healthcare infrastructure cannot protect the American people against this phenomenon. If the American nation needs help, we can render assistance to them, but we do not need their help,” said Salami. As evidence of Iran’s capability to “render assistance” to America, Salami noted what he claimed was IRGC’s early response to the Chinese coronavirus at the onset of its emergence in Qom, the epicenter of Iran’s novel coronavirus outbreak. This claim directly contradicts expert opinion that Iran delayed its initial response to the Chinese coronavirus because it was reluctant to break ties with China, its close economic and political ally. Salami further cited the early organization of up to ten mobile and field hospitals in areas reporting a high number of infections across the country as an example of Iran’s preparedness. He claimed the IRGC stood ready to build more makeshift hospitals if necessary. More recently, Salami said the IRGC had begun holding what he referred to as “biological defense drills” and national disinfection operations. Iran has denounced offers of assistance from the U.S. as hypocritical, claiming that if America genuinely sought to help the country with its Chinese coronavirus outbreak, it would lift its sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Iran would not accept Chinese coronavirus assistance from the United States, claiming it might be “poison” disguised as aid. “Possibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,” Khamenei said on Sunday. “Or if you send therapists and doctors, maybe he wants to see the effect of the poison, since it is said that part of the virus is built for Iran.” This paranoia has seen Iran turn down Chinese coronavirus aid from other sources as well. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) expressed “incomprehension” and “deep surprise” at Iran’s recent rejection of its medical aid on Wednesday. In his comments on Sunday, Khamenei called America’s offer to help Iran strange, promoting a conspiracy theory that the U.S. may have manufactured the Chinese coronavirus as a biological weapon. “Americans have said several times that ‘we are ready to help with treatment and medicine; just ask us and we will help.’ This is one of the weirdest things which they tell us to ask them. You are accused of producing the virus. I do not know how true this accusation is, but when such an accusation is made, which wise person will ask for your help?” Khamenei said. Reports Friday indicate hundreds of people have died after drinking a poison “cure” for the Chinese coronavirus promoted by Iranians on social media. Fake remedies for the Chinese coronavirus have circulated across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it obfuscated the health crisis at its outset. Iran’s own local health authorities question the regime’s official Chinese coronavirus data. Iran has been accused of severely underreporting its numbers on the Chinese coronavirus. At press time Friday, Iran claimed to have 32,332 infections and 2,378 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus. However, the real number of Chinese coronavirus cases in Iran remains unknown, and the figures provided by state media are viewed with severe skepticism by most health officials. Iran’s government has been criticized for lying about the country’s actual numbers of coronavirus deaths. Regional Iranian officials have reported higher rates in their own regions than those reported by the Health Ministry, publicly questioning the state statistics.",Iran’s IRGC Terrorists: ‘We Can Help Americans Fight Coronavirus’,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/irans-irgc-terrorists-can-help-americans-fight-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Democrat presidential front runner Joe Biden held a virtual town hall meeting on Friday with medical and emergency personnel dealing with coronavirus, and he suffered an awkward mental collapse as he fumbled through his notes. Biden was touting the stimulus bill pushed by President Trump and said, “Child care assistance for essential workers like you,” to a participant. “Mortgage payment postponements for anyone financially impacted by the crisis,” he continued from the script. “That’s what has been passed. Now it has to be implemented. So, I don’t think if you have any difficulty — not a joke — anybody moving on your mortgage, any of that, pick up the phone and call me, I’ll let you know how to get— no, I really mean it,” Biden said. “Not a joke,” he emphasized. He then seemed to lose his train of thought. “But there’s a lot more.

"Taxpayers should bail out the low-wage migrant workers who support the city’s elite economy during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report by the city’s comptroller, Scott Stringer. Legal immigrants and illegal migrants are part of the city’s one million population who are “too often ignored, underpaid, and overworked … [and] very often lack healthcare, have to travel long distances to get to work, and struggle with childcare,” said Stringer’s March 26 report. But Stringer’s plea for a taxpayer bailout of city’s cheap labor economy ignores the reality that Americans are impoverished by the elite’s support for mass migration, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. The report cites impoverished “Nurses, janitors, grocery clerks, childcare staff, bus and truck drivers … those in our social service, cleaning, delivery and warehouse, grocery, healthcare, and public transit industries.” “Back in the day when these workers were Americans and unionized, they were making more than a living wage,” she said. Before elites encouraged millions of legal and illegal migrants to flood Americans’ workplaces, she said: People raised their families on those jobs — they were good jobs … They were jobs that people were glad to have, where they could support their families [and homes] on them. They had [medical] benefits. If that was still the system …. they would have  good healthcare plans, and they would have sick leave. Stringer is asking for “taxpayers to subsidize the city’s cheap labor economy,” and to preserve the city’s policy of  “corporate welfare through illegal immigration,” Vaughan said. The disguised plea for the illegal immigration bailout is spotlighted by Stringer’s back-handed admission that “many in New York City are also undocumented, meaning they do all of the above while living in fear of deportation under the current federal administration.” Stringer’s report touts the city’s high poverty levels, noting that 34 percent of  “all frontline workers” are at or below the poverty line. — including roughly 35 percent of rail clerks and 39 percent cleaning workers. The report shows that 35 percent of cleaning workers and 27 percent of retail workers are either legal immigrants or illegal migrants: This high-immigration low-wage economic policy is back by business groups that get more consumers, more renters, and more cheap workers. For example, Stringer’s report was touted in a tweet shared by Todd Schulte, the director of FWD.us, an advocacy group  that was formed by wealthy West Coast investors: .@NYCComptroller new study found 19% of “frontline workers” are non-citizens, “often placing them in a precarious and frightening position in this age of arbitrary ICE crackdowns.” #COVID19 #NewYorkUnited https://t.co/8swfUJhCMl — Eddie (@EddieATaveras) March 27, 2020  Stringer did not ask for an immigration reform that would create a tight labor market where Americans workers could bargain on equal terms with their employers. Instead, Stringer asked for a series of narrow government programs that would ensure that Democrat city officials can claim credit for the taxpayer aid: The City and State should help provide free protective equipment and gear—including gloves, masks, and hand sanitizer—to all businesses … The City and State should subsidize [coronavirus] hazard pay for small businesses in order to properly compensate workers and help recruit new employees in these high-risk and currently understaffed industries … The State and City should ensure access to free healthcare for all direct service workers in “essential industries”—either via Medicaid or otherwise … the State must expand its unemployment, healthcare, and other safety net programs to cover independent contractors … bus service should be preserved while regular off-peak schedules should be maintained on the subway and commuter rail … For the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis, Metro-North and LIRR should charge a $2.75 fare for any and all trips into New York City … the City should offer a subsidy to any frontline worker who is interested in purchasing a bike or e-bike … Free and Easily Accessible Child Care for all Frontline Workers. Stringer’s report also wants city officials to recruit migrants to vote for Democrat politicians: Over half of frontline workers are foreign-born and nearly one-quarter are non-citizens … the City of New York must bolster pathways to citizenship and enable non-citizen voting in all municipal elections … It is only fair that those who pay taxes and provide essential frontline services to all New Yorkers should have a direct say in municipal affairs. New York City’s leaders “have institutionalized the use of illegal workers, and made them a fixture of the workforce in New York,” responded Vaughan. When this is exposed in an economic crisis, they want taxpayers and the government to bail them out with amnesty policies and cash assistance to these workers that they encouraged to settle there, while paying them substandard wages …  The bill is coming due for the cheap labor policies that they encouraged [the city’s] employers to adopt. The public & GOP blocked the business push in Congress to keep 100K+ visa workers in US jobs.Next, biz asks agencies for the labor giveaway, with deceptive op-eds & earnest pleas from elite professional trade associations.OK, so who lobbies back?#H1Bhttps://t.co/OUxZcq1gYU — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 26, 2020 ",New York City Wants Taxpayer Bailout for Low Wage Migrant Economy,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/new-york-city-wants-taxpayer-bailout-for-low-wage-migrant-economy/,Breitbart
"China should be held accountable for its conduct leading up to and following the global coronavirus outbreak, said Gordon Chang, Daily Beast columnist and author of The Great U.S.-China Tech War, offering his remarks on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Mansour asked about possible consequences for China following the worldwide impact of the Chinese government’s mendacity and negligence. “People are furious,” said Mansour, “and if this shutdown [across] the country lasts long, and if the projections are as bad as some of the epidemiologists suggest they will be, we’re going to come out the other end of this extremely angry. We cannot go back to status quo with China. it seems to me that there’s going to be a reckoning, some sort of an international trial.” Mansour added, “‘We are going to have a lot of people sick and tragically dead because of this, and as you said, China’s handling of it — their gross malfeasance — is unacceptable.” LISTEN:  Chang replied, “My mind is just does not able to comprehend this. I am actually surprised by the inhumanity of what they’ve been doing, and it just incomprehensible. When you look at the modeling of virologists, we could have something like 95 million Americans infected, maybe more, and the death toll from that could very well be in the hundreds of thousands.” The coronavirus outbreak increases the urgency to economically decouple from China, maintained Chang. “We probably will follow something close to a trajectory of the countries in Europe, which means we will have perhaps millions or tens of millions of Americans infected, hundreds of thousands of us will not survive this,” Chang stated. “So we have got to understand that however this came out of China — deliberate or accidental — we have got to cut our links with China. We have got to impose costs on China. We’ve got to defend the American Republic because this is an existential crisis for us.” The World Health Organization’s (WHO) political corruption has been further revealed during the viral pandemic, observed Chang. “Dr. Tedros, as the director general of the World Health Organization, has actually hindered the world’s response to the coronavirus,” Chang remarked. “So he delayed, at a critical moment, the declaration of a health emergency. He also delayed the declaration of the pandemic. Now both of these things eventually got done, but much later, and as the World Health Organization delayed, people got sick and people died. So this is an example of China actually pressuring the head of the WHO and senior WHO officials into doing things which really resulted in tragedy.” The U.S. should defund the WHO in the absence of executive reform, Chang recommended. “We’ve got to remember that Dr. Tedros himself is a die-hard committed socialist,” noted Chang. “During one of his early trips to Beijing during the coronavirus epidemic, he was talking about China’s response and [how] it showed the superiority of the socialist system, thereby him making comments to the detriment of democracies.” Chang added, “I think that we need to either get rid of all the top leadership of WHO, and it’s a lot of people there who need to leave, or we defund the organization. But this organization certainly has been hindering the world’s response to this epidemic.” Hayward noted the WHO’s initial opposition to the implementation of travel bans regarding China as a disease-controlling measure. Chang noted the unified opposition to President Donald Trump’s use of travel bans from many Democrats, U.S. news media outlets, and the Chinese government. “The one thing that President Trump did on January 31 was to impose the travel restrictions and the quarantine. and President Trump took enormous heat from, not only from Beijing, but from domestic critics, but that was the one thing that bought the United States some time,” Chang stated. “If we didn’t have that, we would be in even worse shape than we are today, because that gave the CDC and others the opportunity to mount a defense.” Using travel bans “was the most important decision that the federal government made,” concluded Chang, “and President Trump made it early and he made the right call.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

"(AFP) — The Australian military will help enforce the quarantine of travellers returning to the country, with the prime minister unveiling strict new measures and door-to-door checks Friday to rein in the spread of Covid-19. With some two-thirds of Australia’s 3,000 COVID-19 cases still linked to overseas travel, Scott Morrison said 14-day home quarantines would now be actively policed with the help of the military. Thousands of citizens and residents are still arriving in Australia every day and there have been instances of return travellers repeatedly breaking a promise to stay at home. Morrison said all returnees arriving after midnight Saturday would now be kept in hotels in the city of arrival for the duration of their quarantine. Those already on Australian soil and under orders to self-quarantine for two weeks will face active checks, he said. Quarantine measures will be getting “a lot tougher and a lot stricter,” Morrison said, adding the Australian Defence Force would “assist in the compliance with these arrangements.” Police in New South Wales this week said they found a 65-year-old woman breaking quarantine twice after returning from Bali. She was slapped with two $1,000 (US$610) fines.

Around 200 of the 2,700 passengers who were allowed to disembark one ship in central Sydney without testing have subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. The presence of three other cruise ships off the coast of Western Australia has sparked an intense debate about whether they should be allowed to dock. Tens of thousands of Australians are still believed to be overseas and Morrison said it would become harder for them to come home. He indicated efforts would be made to return some trapped in locations like Peru, but those who departed after the government advised against all foreign travel may be on their own.

"PARIS (AP) – Criminals are preying on a fearful public and disrupting the provision of medical care during the coronavirus pandemic by selling counterfeit products, impersonating health workers, and hacking computers as many citizens do their jobs online at home, European law enforcement agency Europol said Friday. In one instance, a cyberattack on a major hospital in the Czech Republic where COVID-19 tests are carried out forced the cancellation of planned surgeries, Europol said in a new report. Organized crime groups, well-known for identifying new opportunities, have found new pathways to scam people made vulnerable by fears of the virus, which, like criminals, know no borders, according to the report. “Criminals have quickly seized the opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modes of operation or developing new criminal activities,” Europol Executive Director, Catherine de Bolle said in a statement. She added that organized crime groups’ “capacity to exploit this crisis means we need to be constantly vigilant and prepared.” Europol’s report lists four main avenues for illicit activity: cybercrime, fraud, counterfeit and substandard goods, and organized property crime. Criminals manufacture and sell high-demand products like masks or medicine, impersonate medical workers to get into homes or businesses, and break into a gold mine of information with so many European citizens now doing their jobs online at home. Coronavirus-related criminal activity is not limited to Europe. A March 3-10 operation in 90 countries, overseen by international police agency Interpol, dug out suspects seeking fast cash, notably with the sale of counterfeit face masks and medicines. Germany: Thieves Steal 50,000 Face Masks from Hospitals in Cologne https://t.co/jn8c3of2aE — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 17, 2020  Interpol said that it disrupted the work of 37 organized crime groups, and seized 34,000 fake and substandard masks, and more than $14 million in potentially dangerous pharmaceuticals. The “corona spray,” “corona packages” and medicines are but “the tip of the iceberg regarding this new trend in counterfeiting,” Interpol said. Covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus, causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, such as fever or coughing for two to three weeks. But it can cause more serious illness and death for others, especially for older adults and people with existing health problems. Europol noted the transfer of 6.6 million euros by a European company to another in Singapore to buy face masks and alcohol gels, widely used now for cleaning hands to protect from the coronavirus. “The goods were never received,” the report said. It did not identify either company. Criminals also lurk at the doorways of private homes as hundreds of millions of people across Europe are confined under government orders to slow the spread of the virus. The fraud schemes used to get inside private residences to steal vary but often involve someone impersonating medical officials, conducting a “corona test,” providing hygiene products or informative material, Europol said. In one European country, an individual was notified by phone of a relative hospitalized with the virus and then received a middle-of-the-night visit from individuals in protective gear posing as doctors who actually swabbed the victim’s mouth. European officials have warned the public to be wary of potential scam artists during the unprecedented and vulnerable times. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted recently that increased time online, for work or to while away days and weeks of confinement, means that criminals “exploit our concerns about the coronavirus.” “Our fear becomes their business opportunity,” she said.

"German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) findings indicate that the Turkish government purposely incited riots by planting members of its security services among crowds of migrants. The BND accuses Turkish forces of intermixing with migrants along the border and posing as migrants themselves, throwing rocks and other missiles at Greek forces in an effort to incite riots and facilitate a breakthrough into Greece and the European Union. The findings were denied by the Turkish authorities, according to German tabloid Bild, and the BND did not disclose further detail on the allegations to the newspaper when asked to comment. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the border to Europe in late February, with Greece recording over 50,000 attempts by migrants to illegally cross the border by mid-March. The Turkish government was forced to close the border again due to fears that the large crowds that had gathered in the area could potentially spread the Wuhan coronavirus which has recently begun to surge in Turkey, with over 3,600 cases recorded as of Friday.

Greek Minister for Citizens Protection, Michalis Chrisochoidis, stated that most of the small minority of families and elderly had left the border area already, and that only 5,000 or so young men, who he labelled “provocateurs,” remained. The German intelligence service’s claim that Turkey has co-ordinated the border violence are not the first levelled at the Islamist-led country since it “opened the gates” in late February. Greek authorities report that the Turks used buses and trains to help ship thousands of migrants to the border area along the Evros river, some direct from prison. The Greeks also stated that Turkish authorities helped both arm migrants with tear gas and provide them with cover during repeated attempts to break through the Greek border — which is also a common external border for the EU’s frontierless Schengen area.

"ROME (AP) – Doctors and nurses in Italy’s overwhelmed northern hospitals have welcomed a slight stabilizing in the number of coronavirus infections but fear the virus is still silently spreading in the country’s south 2 1/2 weeks into the West’s most extreme nationwide shutdown. As the dead in Italy keep piling up, virologists warn that the actual number of cases could be up to more than five times as high as the official count, which reached just shy of 86,500 on Friday. That means infections will still climb even with Italians ordered to stay home for all but essential activity. Italy, one of the hot spots in the global pandemic, has by far the most virus deaths of any nation in the world, a grim tally that reached 9,134 as of Friday. Italy also surpassed China in its number of confirmed cases and has more than any nation besides the United States, which outpaced China in total cases on Thursday. “It is something devastating,” said the Rev. Mario Carminati, who has turned over a church in the tiny Lombard town of Seriate to host coffins before they are taken by military convoy to be cremated. This week, dozens were lined up in two neat rows down the central aisle, and were immediately replaced by new ones when they were taken away. “At least the relatives and family know that someone is taking care of them, with a prayer and a benediction before they are taken away,” he said. Despite the toll, officials have also expressed cautious optimism that the exponential spread of the virus is starting to slow in the hard-hit north, thanks to two weeks of military-enforced stay-at-home orders. For several days this week, new infections and deaths showed signs of slowing down, and emergency rooms weren’t seeing the tsunami of sick that characterized the first weeks of the pandemic following Italy’s first positive test Feb. 20. Coronavirus: Italy Sees Worst Day Yet, 969 Dead in 24 Hours; Death Toll Exceeds 9,000 https://t.co/axzYluQP4G — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 28, 2020  “The numbers are still high, but for a few days now the numbers have stopped rising, thank God,” said Dr Luca Lorini, head of intensive care at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo, one of the hardest hit of Italy´s public hospitals. Some 500 medical personnel at the hospital are infected, and Lorini said he has found himself treating colleagues, friends, children of friends and parents of friends in his overwhelmed 88-bed ICU that serves a city of 120,000. He marvels that he is still standing and wonders if maybe he was infected early on with slight symptoms and developed immunity. Nationwide, at least 50 doctors have died and 6,414 medical personnel have tested positive “We know it before we go into battle, and we accept it,” Lorini told The Associated Press. Elsewhere in Bergamo, the Italian army’s Alpini mountaineering forces are building a field hospital to be staffed, in part, by some of the 150 medical personnel sent by Russia, one of only a handful of countries along with China and Cuba to respond to Italy´s urgent appeal for medical equipment, protective masks and personnel. But the need is also growing in the south, where hospitals are even less prepared and equipped than the prosperous north. In one week, Puglia in the “heel” of the Italian peninsula went from 478 cases to 1,182, with a doubling of ICU patients. Campania also doubled its caseload to 1,310 and tripled the number of people in ICUs. “It’s a matter of hours, not days,” the governor of the Campania region that includes Naples wrote to the central government, complaining that his urgent requests for ventilators had gone unheeded. “There is a real chance of adding a tragedy of the south to the tragedy of the north.” Cateno De Luca, mayor of the Sicilian city of Messina, took the extraordinary step of recording a warning to residents in his nasal, gravelly voice for drones to play as they fly over the seaside city monitoring residents’ movements. “Don’t go outside! That is an order from Mayor De Luca!” the drone blasts. Coronavirus Explosion In Welsh Region Resembles Italy ‘Pattern’, UK Daily Deaths Break 100 https://t.co/ZD32kd7TmJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 27, 2020  Italy’s high death toll and the virus’ aggressive spread in the country has led Italian epidemiologists to estimate that the true number of infected people could be as high as 450,000 and to say that under-testing is putting Italians at risk of infection. Currently, Italy only tests people showing symptoms, because its labs cannot process any more, and to date nearly 395,000 tests have been performed. Virologist Dr Andrea Crisanti, director of molecular medicine at the University of Padua and a consultant for the Veneto regional government, points to the only controlled epidemiological study done in the outbreak, in the tiny Veneto town of Vo´Euganeo, as evidence that Italy’s true numbers of infection are much higher – and that the risk of not testing more widely is enormous. Italy recorded its first death in Vo, and the town was locked down Feb. 22 and the entire population of 3,300 tested. According to the study, 3 per cent of Vo’s residents were infected, but between 50-75 per cent of them were asymptomatic. But because all positive cases were identified, isolated and quarantined, regardless of whether they were symptomatic, Vo has seen its new infections crumble. “This tiny town has taught us a lot,” Crisanti told state-run RAI radio. Crisanti said the Vo study showed that even asymptomatic people transmit the virus, since the few new infections registered between tests were within households of asymptomatic people. The only way to stop the spread, he told RAI, is more testing, active surveillance of all positive cases and quarantine. Based on the Vo results, Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia is planning to vastly ramp up testing across the region, aiming to reach 20,000 tests a day and hand out protective masks to each family. Already, Veneto has tested more than 83,000 people, and compared to hard-hit Lombardy next door, has a comparatively low mortality rate with 313 dead and 7,497 positive cases. The industrial lobby Confindustria estimates a cost of 70 billion to 100 billion euros of national wealth a month if 70 per cent of companies are closed, as anticipated… ""We are entering a war economy,"" said Confindustria President Vincenzo Boccia https://t.co/3szitTODmT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 26, 2020  The government on March 10 imposed a nationwide lockdown after an initial quarantine of a dozen small towns in Lombardy and Veneto failed to stop the spread of the virus. On Thursday, Italy idled all non-essential production and industry, the most widespread manufacturing shutdown in the world. The industrial lobby Confindustria has estimated it could cost 70 billion-to-100 billion euros ($77 billion-$110 billion) of national wealth a month if 70 per cent of companies are closed. Two weeks in, the measures appear to be having their effect on the virus, slowing new infections and relieving pressure on the health system. By Friday, nearly 11,000 of Italy’s 86,500 infected had been cured. The president of Italy’s National Institutes of Health, Dr. Silvio Brusaferro, said Friday that Italy hadn’t yet reached the peak of its infection curve or begun to see a decline. But he said: “What we have are signs of a slowing that makes us think that we are close.” Twenty days after coming down with a fever, and after nearly a week in an air-pressurized helmet pumping oxygen into his virus-ravaged lungs, Fausto Russo is now breathing on his own and hopes to go home as early as Sunday from the Santa Maria Goretti hospital in Latina, near Rome. “It’s a horrible sensation, not being able to breathe,” said Russo, a 38-year-old fitness trainer. “Imagine putting your head under water.” Lorini, the doctor, knows well the toll that the virus takes on both patients and hospital staff. When he goes home each night, a five-minute walk from the hospital, he allows himself a few minutes to listen to music and “unplug” from the intensity of the ICU ward. His current favourite song is Bruce Springsteen´s “Secret Garden.” He smiles as he thinks about the lyrics. “You’ve gone a million miles/ How far’d you get/ To that place where/ You can’t remember/ And you can’t forget.” “Listen to it today,” Lorini suggested. “It will give you a sense of tenderness.”   ___ Barry reported from Soave, Italy.",Medics Fear New Coronavirus Onslaught in Southern Italy,2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/28/medics-fear-new-coronavirus-onslaught-in-southern-italy/,Breitbart

Pelosi said, “We need to address pensions. Actually, in that case, we had the support of the president, but not Mitch McConnell. He wouldn’t do it. He said he’d do it in another bill. So, we’re setting up for the next bill.” Pelosi also listed other priorities, like increased support for hospitals, expanded family medical leave, ensuring more money for DC, increased funding for state and local governments, stronger OSHA rules, and ensuring completely free coronavirus testing. She concluded, “The list goes on. There [are] so many needs that we have in there that are urgent to this health issue that are specific to the coronavirus. We’re not having a wish list for all time.

"The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) has predicted that warmer temperatures this summer are unlikely to halt the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. The agency said on Wednesday that despite some hopes, a summer slowdown was unlikely, stating: “There is no evidence to date that SARS-CoV-2 will display a marked winter seasonality, such as other human coronaviruses in the northern hemisphere.” The ECDC noted that coronavirus was able to survive and spread in areas like Singapore where high humidity and tropical temperatures have not seemed to have had dramatic effects on the spread of the virus, Kathimerini reports. Along with warning that summer is unlikely to give respite in terms of the spread of the disease, the ECDC added that by the middle of April it was likely that every European country would see its intensive care unit (ICU) beds at total capacity without any additional measures. The agency also increased its threat level for seniors who are infected with the virus to “very high” while maintaining a moderate level for the general population as a whole.

"(AFP) — Vigilantes in some Australian outback towns have reportedly slashed tyres of those fleeing coronavirus hotspots in the big cities, according to a government minister who urged calm on Friday. Remote areas in the northeastern state of Queensland are being inundated with travellers — mostly retirees — trying to escape the highly infectious disease, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said. “As the borders are being shut, we are seeing a surge of grey nomads from southern states, and also from southeast Queensland, go to southwest Queensland to hide from the coronavirus,” Littleproud told Seven News. “Unfortunately this action could turn caravans into the cruise ships of the outback if someone is infected and spreads it in small communities.” Easter is normally prime season for tourism in Queensland’s west, as retired travellers visit the outback and remote areas of the state in droves. Visitors’ vehicles had their tyres slashed in some small towns as panicked residents fear their health systems may struggle to cope with the epidemic, he said. “I understand the concern of these people in these communities,” he added.

But some areas are pushing for tighter restrictions within states, including far north Queensland, where much of the country’s mining and food production is based. “Quarantining North Qld isn’t about playing politics, it’s about saving lives,” outspoken North Queensland senator Bob Katter tweeted on Thursday. “If north Queensland goes down, so does nearly 10 per cent of your fruit and vegetables, and a quarter of your mining industry goes down with it,” Katter said in an earlier statement. Australian officials have repeatedly urged people to avoid travelling as confirmed cases of the virus climb. “This is not holiday break season,” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said after announcing the border closures on Wednesday. “This is the season to stay at home with your family.” Crikey!

"Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) cast doubt Friday on President Trump’s hope to reopen the economy by Easter, at least in the Bay State, citing information from public health experts and healthcare providers. “The information we’re getting from public health experts and from healthcare providers here in Massachusetts — yeah, no,” Baker said during Friday’s press conference. “We’re not going to be up and running by Easter, no.” The doubt comes as he continues to pursue aggressive measures in his state, including a stay-at-home order and the closure of nonessential businesses. He is also urging all travelers entering Massachusetts — no matter where they are coming from — to self-isolate for 14 days. Trump, however, has expressed optimism, telling Fox News’s Bill Hemmer this week that he would like to see the U.S. economy reopened by Easter, April 12. “I would love to have the country opened up and rearing to go by Easter,” Trump said. “That would be a great American resurrection,” Hemmer remarked. Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the administration’s coronavirus task force, described Easter as an “aspirational goal” and acknowledged that it could look different in certain areas of the country, specifically those hit particularly hard by the virus. “The president said he would love to see it around Easter, but whenever that day is that we can responsibly begin to open up portions of the country,” Pence told CNBC. “But let me be very clear, there’s going to be areas of the country where we need to continue to lean into mitigation efforts,” he added. Massachusetts currently has more than 3,200 confirmed cases of the virus.","GOP Gov.

"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is requiring travelers from Louisiana to self-isolate for 14 days and said the Florida Highway Patrol will install checkpoints on major roads to screen travelers from that area, he announced on Friday. DeSantis is imposing restrictions on travelers fleeing to Florida from Louisiana — particularly New Orleans, which is emerging as one of the hotspots of the coronavirus outbreak. “New Orleans is having a lot of problems — they may not be quite as widespread as New York City. There was a concern from the Panhandle that this could impact them,” DeSantis said during a press conference on Friday. “They are working hard to keep their rates low and we don’t want to add any problems to them,” he added. The Florida Highway Patrol will install checkpoints on the major roads along the Alabama-Florida state line and screen drivers from Louisiana, with the exception of those driving commercial vehicles. “There’ll probably be a diversion for folks with certain license plates,” DeSantis said. Others will be required to tell authorities where they are staying in Florida and told to self-isolate for 14 days. A violation of that order could result in criminal penalties. “All we’re trying to do is keep our residents here safe,” DeSantis said. “If they’re telling you to shelter in place, then do that. But don’t come here, because we’re trying to protect our folks.” DeSantis issued a similar order this week, requiring travelers fleeing the New York Tri-State area to self-isolate for 14 days. “There’s over 190 direct flights from the New York City area to the state of Florida, and I would reckon given the outbreak there, that every single flight has somebody on it who is positive for COVID-19,” DeSantis said on Monday. “And so as we are working to stop it in the state of Florida, you’re consistently having people come in from one of the top hot spots in the entire world,” he continued. “We don’t have people coming from Wuhan, we don’t have people coming from Milan, yet you have a flood of people still coming from New York City,” he added. DeSantis also announced the suspension of new vacation rentals as an effort to discourage potentially infected travelers from entering the Sunshine State state for refuge. Florida currently has over 3,100 confirmed cases of the virus.","Florida Gov.

"(AFP) — Europe was reeling from a staggering surge in coronavirus deaths Saturday, still days or weeks from what experts desperately hope will be the epidemic’s peak. Grim new tolls from Italy and Spain came as the IMF confirmed the world economy has plunged into a historic slump, and the US invoked wartime procurement powers. More than 600,000 cases of the new coronavirus have been officially recorded around the world since the outbreak of the epidemic, according to an AFP tally. Variations in testing regimes mean the true number is likely far higher still, and confirmed deaths are mounting. Spain recorded 832 fatalities in 24 hours, bringing its toll to 5,690, second in the world only to Italy, which confirmed a one-day record of 969 on Friday. Elsewhere, Iran announced 139 more deaths and India sealed off a dozen Punjab villages that had been visited by a guru now known to be infected and a possible “super-spreader”. And, in South Africa, Johannesburg police resorted to rubber bullets to enforce social distancing on a crowd queueing for supplies outside a downtown supermarket during a national lockdown. The United States now has the world’s highest single number of Covid-19 cases but per capita European nations are still the worst hit, with emergency services struggling to cope. Farage: Communist China Regime Responsible for Virus ‘Nightmare’ https://t.co/xWJCmj7Ie3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 19, 2020  Wuhan partially reopens  However, two months of almost total isolation appear to have paid off in China’s Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, which was partially reopened. Since January, residents have been forbidden to leave, with roadblocks installed and millions subjected to dramatic restrictions on their daily life. But on Saturday people were allowed to enter the city, and most of the subway network restarted. Some shopping centres will open their doors next week. The European Union economy has already been disrupted by border closures and stay-at-home orders, and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that the bloc could lose it legitimacy. “If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’etre to the people,” he told the Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper. Italy, backed by France and Spain, wants Europe to come up with a stronger financial response to the crisis, but Germany and the Netherlands are resisting calls to pool national debts. Meanwhile, on Friday, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said massive spending will be needed to help developing nations, warning: “It is clear that we have entered a recession.” In the U.S., which now has more than 104,000 Covid-19 patients, President Donald Trump invoked emergency powers Friday to force a private company to make medical equipment.

With 60 per cent of the country in lockdown, and infections skyrocketing, Trump also signed the largest stimulus package in US history, worth $2 trillion. It came as Italy recorded almost 1,000 deaths from the virus on Friday — the worst one-day toll anywhere since the pandemic began. One coronavirus sufferer, a cardiologist from Rome who has since recovered, recalled his hellish experience at a hospital in the capital. “The treatment for the oxygen therapy is painful, looking for the radial artery is difficult. Desperate other patients were crying out, ‘enough, enough’,” he told AFP. Infection rates in Italy are on a downward trend, but the head of the national health institute Silvio Brusaferro said it was not out of the woods yet, predicting “we could peak in the next few days”. Spain has the world’s second-highest coronavirus death toll after Italy and the number of cases jumped to 72,248 on Saturday as the country moves to significantly increase testing. Smaller Belgium and Luxembourg also saw a steep climb in deaths, with 353 recorded in the former on Saturday — up from 289 the day before — and 15 in the grand duchy, up from nine. Europe has suffered the brunt of the coronavirus crisis in recent weeks, with millions across the continent on lockdown and the streets of Paris, Rome and Madrid eerily empty. In Britain, the men leading the country’s fight against the coronavirus — Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Health Secretary Matt Hancock — have both tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, other countries across the world were bracing for the virus’s full impact, with AFP tallies showing more than 26,000 deaths globally. The World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa warned the continent faced a “dramatic evolution” of the pandemic, as South Africa also began life under lockdown and reported its first virus death. But the Fake News media believe the communists. pic.twitter.com/KGrcdks73S — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 27, 2020  Younger patients  In the United States, known infections jumped past 104,000, the world’s highest figure, with 1,711 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. In New York City, the U.S. epicentre of the crisis, health workers battled a surging toll — including an increasing number of younger patients — while struggling with a severe shortage of protective equipment. “Now it’s 50-year-olds, 40-year-olds, 30-year-olds,” said one respiratory therapist. To ease the strain on virus-swamped emergency rooms in Los Angeles, a giant US naval hospital ship docked there to take patients with other conditions. In New Orleans, famed for its jazz and nightlife, health experts believe the month-long Mardi Gras in February could be largely responsible for its severe outbreak. “This is going to be the disaster that defines our generation,” said Collin Arnold, director of the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness for New Orleans. But as Europe and the United States struggle to contain the pandemic, aid groups have warned the death toll could be in the millions in low-income countries and war zones such as Syria and Yemen, where hygiene conditions are already dire and healthcare systems are in tatters. burs-dc/ach Turkey Accused of ‘Fanning Flames’ of Europe Coronavirus Crisis by Pushing Migrants to Border https://t.co/HcF3ll5tqw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 18, 2020   ","Coronavirus: Spain Logs 832 Fatalities in 24 hours, IMF Confirms World In Recession",2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/28/coronaviurs-spain-logs-832-fatalities-in-24-hours-imf-confirms-world-recession/,Breitbart
"ATLANTA (AP) — The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery fought to end segregation, lived to see the election of the country’s first black president and echoed the call for “justice to roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream” in America. For more than four decades after the death of his friend and civil rights icon, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the fiery Alabama preacher was on the front line of the battle for equality, with an unforgettable delivery that rivaled King’s — and was often more unpredictable. Lowery had a knack for cutting to the core of the country’s conscience with commentary steeped in scripture, refusing to back down whether the audience was a Jim Crow racist or a U.S. president. “We ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get in back; when brown can stick around; when yellow will be mellow; when the red man can get ahead, man; and when white will embrace what is right,” Lowery inaugural benediction in 2009. Lowery, 98, died Friday at home in Atlanta, surrounded by family members, they said in a statement. He died from natural causes unrelated to the coronavirus outbreak, the statement said. “Tonight, the great Reverend Joseph E. Lowery transitioned from earth to eternity,” The King Center in Atlanta Lowery in a Friday night tweet. “He was a champion for civil rights, a challenger of injustice, a dear friend to the King family.” Lowery led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for two decades — restoring the organization’s financial stability and pressuring businesses not to trade with South Africa’s apartheid-era regime — before retiring in 1997. Considered the dean of civil rights veterans, he lived to celebrate a November 2008 milestone that few of his movement colleagues thought they would ever witness — the election of an African-American president. At an emotional victory celebration for President-elect Barack Obama in Atlanta, Lowery said, “America tonight is in the process of being born again.” An early and enthusiastic supporter of Obama over then-Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Lowery also gave the benediction at Obama’s inauguration. “We thank you for the empowering of thy servant, our 44th president, to inspire our nation to believe that, yes, we can work together to achieve a more perfect union,” he said. In 2009, Obama awarded Lowery the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. In another high-profile moment, Lowery drew a standing ovation at the 2006 funeral of King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, when he criticized the war in Iraq, saying, “For war, billions more, but no more for the poor.” The comment also drew head shakes from then-President George Bush and his father, former president George H.W. Bush, who were seated behind the pulpit. Lowery’s involvement in civil rights grew naturally out of his Christian faith. He often preached that racial discrimination in housing, employment and health care was at odds with such fundamental Christian values as human worth and the brotherhood of man. “I’ve never felt your ministry should be totally devoted to making a heavenly home. I thought it should also be devoted to making your home here heavenly,” he once said. Lowery remained active in fighting issues such as war, poverty and racism long after retirement, and survived prostate cancer and throat surgery after he beat Jim Crow. His wife, and served as head of SCLC/WOMEN, died in 2013. “I’ll miss you, Uncle Joe. You finally made it up to see Aunt Evelyn again,” King’s daughter, Bernice King, said in a Friday night. Lowery was pastor of the Warren Street Methodist Church in Mobile, Alabama, in the 1950s when he met King, who then lived in Montgomery, Alabama. Lowery’s meetings with King, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy and other civil rights activists led to the SCLC’s formation in 1957. The group became a leading force in the civil rights struggle of the 1960s. Lowery became SCLC president in 1977 following the resignation of Abernathy, who had taken the job after King was assassinated in 1968. He took over an SCLC that was deeply in debt and losing members rapidly. Lowery helped the organization survive and guided it on a new course that embraced more mainstream social and economic policies. Coretta Scott King once said Lowery “has led more marches and been in the trenches more than anyone since Martin.” He was arrested in 1983 in North Carolina for protesting the dumping of toxic wastes in a predominantly black county and in 1984 in Washington while demonstrating against apartheid. He recalled a 1979 confrontation in Decatur, Alabama, when he and others were protesting the case of a mentally disabled black man charged with rape. He recalled that bullets whizzed inches above their heads and a group of Klan members confronted them. “I could hear them go ‘whoosh,'” Lowery said. “I’ll never forget that. I almost died 24 miles from where I was born.” In the mid-1980s, he led to stop selling South African canned fruit and frozen fish when that nation was in the grip of apartheid. He also continued to urge blacks to exercise their hard-won rights by registering to vote. “Black people need to understand that the right to vote was not a gift of our political system but came as a result of blood, sweat and tears,” he said in 1985. Like King, Lowery juggled his civil rights work with ministry. He pastored United Methodist churches in Atlanta for decades and continued preaching long after retiring. Born in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1921, Joseph Echols Lowery grew up in a Methodist church where his great-grandfather, the Rev. Howard Echols, was the first black pastor. Lowery’s father, a grocery store owner, often protested racism in the community. After college, Lowery edited a newspaper and taught school in Birmingham, but the idea of becoming a minister “just kept gnawing and gnawing at me,” he said. After marrying Evelyn Gibson, a Methodist preacher’s daughter, he began his first pastorate in Birmingham in 1948. In a 1998 interview, Lowery said he was optimistic that true racial equality would one day be achieved. “I believe in the final triumph of righteousness,” he said. “The Bible says weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” A member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Lowery is survived by his three daughters, Yvonne Kennedy, Karen Lowery and Cheryl Lowery-Osborne. ___ Errin Haines, a former staffer of The Associated Press, was the principal writer of this obituary.","Joseph Lowery, Civil Rights Leader and MLK Aide, Dies at 98",2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/news/joseph-lowery-civil-rights-leader-and-mlk-aide-dies-at-98/,Breitbart
"Friday on Fox News Channel, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) went on offense against his colleagues for the procedural manner used to pass the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Earlier in the day, the House of Representatives approved package passed the Senate earlier in the week. However, House members were forced to overcome a procedural move from Massie attempting to force members to vote in person. “I mean, here, think about the arrogance of these congressmen,” Massie said. “They’re telling the truckers to keep driving so that their grocery stores will have groceries. They’re telling the UPS drivers to keep bringing their Amazon packages. They’re telling the bagger at the grocery store to keep bagging those groceries.” “But these congressmen make $174,000 a year,” he continued. “They’ve got the best health care that you can buy these days right now. And they’re telling people that they should — that the congressmen need to stay home, but everybody else needs to work for them. I think that’s the wrong message, but that’s — really gives you a glimpse into how some of these people in Washington, D.C. think.” The Kentucky congressman also insisted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) did not fulfill his pledge to allow for debate, noting that he was denied an opportunity to speak and argued McCarthy was motivated by his quest to become House Speaker. “First of all, they had four hours of debate, and they couldn’t find one minute to allow me to debate,” Massie said. “That’s because they don’t want to hear the truth. If this bill is such a great bill, why not have everybody vote on it? Now, the vote he’s talking about, you know, writing her name on a slip of paper? That’s not showing up in casting a vote that’s going to be recorded for all time in the congressional record. If you — and so, it’s not a real vote, he was trying to have a pretend to vote to placate everybody and say that you could stay home.” “By the way, Kevin McCarthy wants to be the next speaker, so he wanted to make this as easy as he could on everybody,” he continued. “He was trying to be Santa Claus and say, you can stay home, and you don’t really have to vote. And we’ll pretend like we’re voting here, and then we’ll tell everybody that’s what it is. The problem with Kevin’s plan is it didn’t satisfy the Constitution. I literally had to tweet the Constitution and shame everybody, basically, into acknowledging that if you don’t have a quorum, you can’t pass a bill in Congress.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","Massie Slams ‘Arrogance’ of Congress for the ‘Need to Stay Home,’ Saying ‘Everybody Else Needs to Work for Them’",2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/28/massie-slams-arrogance-of-congress-for-the-need-to-stay-home-saying-everybody-else-needs-to-work-for-them/,Breitbart
"President Trump posted a powerful video from his reelection campaign highlighting the administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and heaping praise on the American people, who are “rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy.” “In times of struggle we see the true greatness of the American character Americans from all walks of life are rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy,” Trump states in the video, which cuts away to clips of politicians, health officials, and political pundits praising the administration’s leadership:  “He said everything that I could have hoped for,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) says in the video. “I can tell you the actions he has taken, his team has been on it,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) remarks. The video keenly stresses the role of the American people in fighting the “unseen enemy” and features one of the president’s remarks made at a recent coronavirus task force briefing. “The one that really deserves the credit are the American people,” Trump says. “Our message is to all Americans we love them, we’re with them, and we will not let them down,” he adds. This is not the first time Trump has used the term “unseen enemy” to refer to the current crisis. “Defeating this unseen enemy requires the help and commitment of every single American,” he said during a coronavirus task force briefing last week. The president has remained optimistic throughout the crisis and signaled that he would like to see the economy begin to reopen as early as Easter. “I think you’ll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy,” Trump said during Thursday’s briefing. Poll after poll has shown that the majority of the American people approve of the administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. A Harris Poll released last week showed Trump’s approval rating, on the handling of the coronavirus, specifically, jumping five points in a matter of days — 51 percent to 56 percent. An Ipsos/ABC News poll released this week showed similar results, with 55 percent of Americans approving of Trump’s response to the pandemic. What is more, polls are also indicating that Americans have higher approval of Trump’s response to the crisis than the media’s.

That compliment stands in contrast to her frequent criticism of President Trump and his response to the coronavirus pandemic. Without evidence, Whitmer alleged on Friday that the Trump administration told her state it was on its own: We need assistance. When the federal government told us that we needed to go it ourself, we started procuring every item we get our hands-on. But what I’ve gotten back is that vendors with whom we’ve procured contracts are now being told not to send stuff here to Michigan. It’s really concerning. In response, Trump dubbed the Democrat as “Half Whitmer,” one of his signature diminutive nicknames. In her selfie video, Whitmer concluded by saying the state is “worried about making it through this weekend, and that’s why it’s on all of us to lock arms and to meet this challenge.” Earlier this week, an executive order from Whitmer shut down all “non-essential” businesses and services across the state and required residents to stay home: Businesses and operations maintaining in-person activities must adopt social distancing practices and other mitigation measures to protect workers and patrons. Those practices and measures include, but are not limited to: …

"Pastor Robert Jeffress of Dallas First Baptist Church said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday that particularly during the coronavirus pandemic left-wing groups are trying to drive a wedge between President Trump and his evangelical base and using the crisis to push their radical pro-abortion agenda. Jeffress, who heads one of the largest evangelical churches in the country, slammed left-wing groups for pushing their political agendas during the coronavirus pandemic — specifically, abortion. “The left has not given up their agenda. Right here in Texas, Planned Parenthood has sued our state and Gov. Abbott because he declared that abortion is not an essential service during the coronavirus pandemic,” Jeffress said. “In other words, they are suing for the right to have abortions take priority over other surgical procedures and tie up our healthcare workers and our medical facilities during this crisis. That is absurd.”  “You know, Cory Booker described abortion as a sacrosanct belief, and I mean that’s really true,” he continued. “It is almost a religion to Democrats and to the left, their so-called right to murder babies, and we are seeing this carried out right now. They believe in unrestricted abortion,” he said. The left’s radical position on abortion will only encourage evangelicals to support Trump in even greater numbers in the general election, Jeffress predicted. “And that’s because Democrats have moved so far to the left on this issue in just three years,” he said, noting the Democrat candidates who had signaled their support for unrestricted abortion. “And to most Americans, that’s not only wrong. It is barbaric.” Nonetheless, Democrats are attempting to drive a wedge between Trump and his evangelical base, even during the coronavirus pandemic. Jeffress slammed the recent New York Times article that essentially blamed the pandemic on evangelical Christians. “God doesn’t want us to be paralyzed with panic during this pandemic. He wants us to exercise faith, but He also wants us to exercise common sense,” he explained. “But what’s really going on here, Matt, is the New York Times and other left-wing groups know that there’s an election coming up in a few months. They know President Trump’s on the glide path to reelection, and they’re trying to do anything they can to separate the president from his evangelical base, thinking maybe he will distance himself from the so-called kooky evangelicals, and they will distance themself from him. Neither is going to happen,” he said. “President Trump won the evangelical vote in 2016 by 81 percent — largest margin in history. Every time I see the president, I tell him I believe he’s on the path to win an even greater margin than the 81 percent,” he said, praising Trump’s accomplishments, many of which resonate with Americans of faith. “Without a doubt, it is the irony of all time that it was a secular real estate tycoon from New York City named Donald Trump who has become the most pro-life, pro-religious liberty, pro-Israel president in the history of America,” he said. That, along with the left’s pursual of its radical left-wing agendas like abortion, especially during the pandemic, will only further rally Trump’s evangelical base, Jeffress suggested, adding that Trump’s likely opponent, Joe Biden (D), must be grilled on the issue. “I hope that President Trump will wrap unrestricted abortion around Joe Biden’s neck. Make him choke on it because he needs to answer to the American people whether or not he believes that abortion is an essential surgery that needs to take priority in this coronavirus crisis,” he added.",Pastor Robert Jeffress: Left Wing Using Coronavirus to Separate Trump from Evangelicals and Push Abortion,2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/28/pastor-robert-jeffress-left-wing-using-coronavirus-separate-trump-evangelical-base-push-abortion/,Breitbart
"A 38-year-old Michigan man with no underlying conditions contracted coronavirus last week and was successfully treated with the drug combination being touted by President Trump. Jim Santilli told talk radio host Steve Gruber he is “living proof” the combination of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin works. Santilli said he became seriously ill March 18 “with severe cardiac and respiratory issues” and was admitted to Henry Ford Macomb Hospital in metro Detroit. According to Gruber, “Santilli said the biggest problem was waiting for test results that took four days to come back. In the meantime his condition worsened by the hour, and he thought he was going to die.” “Santilli says he was slowly drowning and was convinced he ‘would not live until midnight.’ That’s when doctors made a decision he says changed everything,” Gruber said. The survivor said the drug combination began to work “within a few hours.” Santilli credited Trump for his survival. “Donald Trump recommending that medication combination saved my life and a lot of other people’s lives,” he told Gruber. Santilli criticized Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) for her recent threat against doctors and pharmacists, and believed it is a “terrible decision,” adding, “She is sentencing people to death.” Whitmer sent a letter to medical professionals on March 24: Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other ailments for which chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are proven treatments. Reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action. Prescribing any kind of prescription must also be associated with medical documentation showing proof of the medical necessity and medical condition for which the patient is being treated. Again, these are drugs that have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19. According to Gruber: Santilli added that he isn’t the only one that is alive because of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin either. He said the medical staff told him other patients were also responding well to the treatment and their lives are also being saved.

"President Donald Trump has authorized Defense Secretary Mark Esper to order units and individual members in the National Guard and Reserves, as well as certain Individual Ready Reserve members, to active duty to augment forces in the coronavirus response, according to the chief Pentagon spokesperson. “Today the President signed an Executive Order authorizing Secretary Esper to order units and individual members in the National Guard and Reserves and certain Individual Ready Reserve members, to active duty to augment forces for the effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,” said Jonathan Hoffman in a statement released late Friday evening. The authorization allows Esper to activate forces under Title 32, but they are still under the control of state governors, a National Guard spokesman told Breitbart News. It is not an authorization to federalize forces, which would if forces were activated under Title 10, the spokesman said. The statement said that decisions about which individuals may be activated are still being reviewed. “Generally, these members will be persons in Headquarters units and persons with high demand medical capabilities whose call-up would not adversely affect their civilian communities,” the statement said. The statement said the Defense Secretary and Department of Health and Human Services would consult with state officials before “any potential utilization” of National Guard Reserve Component units under the executive order. The statement said there is currently no projected number of expected activations, but the Pentagon can do so “as needed.” “As this is a dynamic situation, we do not currently have a projected number of expected activations, but the Department is now fully authorized to make activations as needed. We will provide updates as they become available,” Hoffman said. “The Department has been committed to using all our capabilities to confront the coronavirus outbreak, and the President’s action today ensures that we can bring select members of the Reserves and National Guard to the fight where needed most,” he said. Thousands of National Guard troops have been activated so far by state governors across the nation. They have been helping with coronavirus testing, delivering meals to homebound residents, helping build hospital spaces, and transporting equipment, and providing other logistical support. They have so far not played law enforcement roles. If activated under Title 10, or “federalized, they would be barred from doing so. In recent days, the Army has reached out to retirees, particularly those with medical expertise, to help coronavirus response efforts. The Navy has also reached out to reservists with medical expertise who are not currently serving medical civilian capacities.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Trump Authorizes Defense Secretary Mark Esper to Order National Guard and Reservists to Active Duty,2020-03-27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/trump-authorizes-defense-secretary-mark-esper-to-order-national-guard-and-reservists-to-active-duty/,Breitbart
"During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) touted the coronavirus relief bill, but stated it won’t be the last piece of legislation on coronavirus Congress will need to pass, and they must make sure hospitals “have more resources, supplies, gloves and masks and medical equipment, to protect themselves and their patients from coronavirus.” Transcript as Follows: “I’m Gary Peters, proudly representing Michigan in the United States Senate. Typically you’d see the Democratic Weekly Address from a studio, but like Americans across the country, I’m practicing social distancing and joining you here from my home in Michigan. There’s no doubt that we’re facing an unprecedented public health emergency, and an economic crisis of epic proportions. As cases of coronavirus are skyrocketing, I, along with my Senate Democratic colleagues, are working to protect the health and safety of people across our nation. Families here in Michigan, and Americans all across the country, are struggling. They’re worried about their health and safety, worried about whether they’ll be able to make ends meet and worried about whether help is on the way. Well after working around the clock, and pressing for significantly more funding and federal resources for our heroic health care professionals on the front lines, we negotiated and passed the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act – also known as the CARES Act. This package is not perfect, but it will provide urgent relief to the American people, the engine of our economy —small businesses — and to our overstretched health care system. It will help Americans who are forced to stay home, and aren’t receiving a paycheck or who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. A record-high 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. But help is on the way, and we have your back. After leading the charge to expand unemployment insurance, with my colleagues Senator Wyden and Leader Schumer, we secured a historic expansion of these benefits. Through this bill, workers can receive $600 per week in additional unemployment compensation. We’ve also included a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits for anyone covered by traditional unemployment insurance, and up to 39 weeks of assistance overall. Workers who aren’t typically eligible for unemployment assistance can get these benefits. If you can’t work or have been laid off, we have your back. Whether you’re a small business owner, freelance worker, independent contractor, working in the gig economy, a seasonal worker, or you’ve recently started or were about to start a new job, you can receive unemployment assistance. We also secured federal funding for states, to eliminate the typical weeklong waiting period between applying for and receiving unemployment assistance. No American worker should have to wonder if they can pay their rent or put food on the table. No one should have to make these choices. And as workers and families face extraordinary personal health and financial challenges, our main street small businesses are reeling too. Some small businesses are at risk of having to close their doors or lay off their employees. They are the backbone of our economy and they need support, now more than ever. And that’s why we expanded funding available for small business loans in the CARES Act. This package increases the funding for the popular and very successful 7(a) small business loan program. In fact it expanded it to $350 billion. It provides $240 million for small business development centers and women’s business centers. And it increases funding for minority centers as well. This will help enable small businesses to pay their rent and keep the lights on. We worked day and night to make sure this legislation provides drastically more critical funding for our hospitals and health care system than what was initially proposed. Many of our hospitals across the country, including in rural communities, are in dire straits. This funding will ensure that our overstretched hospitals can make up for lost revenue, keep their doors open, and make payroll for the selfless, dedicated and brave nurses, doctors and health care professionals who are fighting day and night to stop this pandemic. We must also help ensure they have more resources, supplies, gloves and masks and medical equipment, to protect themselves and their patients from coronavirus. Our work is far from done. We must ensure that the people who need help the most get it. The sweeping legislation we’ve passed is an important step as we navigate this crisis, but it’s not the last action we’ll need to take. We don’t know how long this pandemic will last, but you can count on us to be there every step of the way. For over 200 years, the American people have shown resilience in the face of great challenges. From civil wars, to international conflicts, and yes, pandemics, we have faced these challenges united and with resolve. And like the challenges of the past, together we will overcome the coronavirus pandemic.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",Dem Sen.

"President Donald Trump spoke in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday, stating that he is considering a short-term quarantine of the New York City area to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. “I am now considering and will make a decision very quickly, very shortly, a quarantine because it’s such a hot area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut,” Trump said. “We’ll be announcing that very soon.” The president traveled to Norfolk to see off the USNS Comfort hospital ship as it heads to New York City. He said the quarantine would not affect truckers making deliveries or traveling through the areas and that it would not affect shipping to the City. The president also discussed the issue with reporters outside the White House. “We might not have to do it, but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine — short term, two weeks — on New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut,” Trump said. He stated that many New Yorkers were traveling to Florida, raising the possibility of spreading the virus to the state. “They’re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don’t want that,” Trump said. “Heavily infected.” The president said he would rather not institute a quarantine but that it might be necessary and that he was speaking with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. “You know, I’d rather not do it, but we may need it,” he said.",Donald Trump: ‘We May Need’ New York City Coronavirus Quarantine,2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/28/donald-trump-we-may-need-new-york-city-coronavirus-quarantine/,Breitbart
"Despite outrage over Beijing’s initial coverup of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, the country is already attempting to leverage the global pandemic at a time the U.S. finds itself struggling to contain the disease. Below, in no particular order, are four major ways China is gaining ground from the coronavirus crisis. 1 – China is using the pandemic to position itself as a global response leader while the U.S. shifts to survival mode. China greatly suffered at the start of the pandemic, including during the period it was actively engaged in a coverup of the virus. Now that the crisis seems to have somewhat stabilized in China, the country is positioning itself as the global leader in helping other nations respond to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. And that response offers China a unique opportunity to extend its tentacles by massively expanding its international influence and playing the role of superpower precisely at a time the U.S. has been struggling to contain the virus. In just one example, China has been supplying large quantities of masks to hard-hit countries while the U.S. is fast at work trying to produce enough masks for its own domestic requirements. “This could be the first major global crisis in decades without meaningful U.S. leadership and with significant Chinese leadership,” noted Rush Doshi, director of the China Strategy Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Axios reported that Chinese think tanks are floating the idea of a “Beijing-led global health organization that would rival the [World Health Organization].” “The Chinese government has been trying to project Chinese state power beyond its borders and establish China as a global leader, not dissimilar to what the U.S. government has been doing for the better part of a century, and the distribution of medical aid is part of this mission,” argued Dr. Yangyang Cheng, a postdoctoral research associate at Cornell University and columnist for SupChina. Indeed, China has pledged or provided aid far and wide, from Greece to Italy, Japan, Iraq, Serbia, Spain and even Peru, in an attempt, as the New York Times characterized it, “to reposition itself not as the authoritarian incubator of a pandemic but as a responsible global leader at a moment of worldwide crisis.” “The coronavirus pandemic has become a battleground,” said Bruno Maçães, a former secretary of state for European Affairs in Portugal. “I see China focused on using the crisis as an opportunity to play up the superiority of its model.” “I think this also shows what climate change could look like in the future,” Maçães added, “less an opportunity for global cooperation and more the background for geopolitical competition, with every major actor trying to do better than its rivals.” Peter Rough, former research director for President George W. Bush and a fellow at the Hudson Institute, questioned China’s motives in selectively providing aid to certain countries. Rough wrote at Foreign Policy magazine: Take, for example, the decision by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to donate 800,000 masks to the Netherlands. Why would the conglomerate, known for its closeness to the Chinese government, display such benevolence toward a country which, at the time, had hardly any coronavirus cases? Surely it could not be because the Netherlands’ auction of fifth-generation (5G) mobile licenses is slated for June, and because the Dutch still have to decide whether to exclude Huawei from its 5G networks over espionage concerns. Or consider Italy, where China has sent doctors and donated ventilators that have been in short supply. Does China’s newfound interest in Italy’s well-being stem from genuine concern, or from that of Rome’s status as one of Europe’s biggest supporters of the Belt and Road Initiative? Perhaps, then, China’s donation of 500,000 masks to Greece is an uncharacteristically generous gift. Or is it nothing but a gift horse, part of much longer campaign that has showered Greece with trade and investment? Already, Greece has been a reliable supporter of China in Brussels, which Beijing increasingly counts on to veto any measures China considers to be against its interests—on trade, security, or human rights, for example. China may also be seeking to drive a wedge in Europe where it has focused some of its strategically offered aid on non-EU countries at a time when EU members are closing their borders. In one of many examples, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters that he penned a letter to his “brother and friend” Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, asking for medical aid, writing that “the only country that can help us is China.” “European solidarity does not exist,” Vucic complained. “That was a fairy tale on paper. I believe in my brother and friend Xi Jinping, and I believe in Chinese help.” 2 – America and the rest of the world rely on China for pharmaceuticals, a phenomenon Beijing is already starting to leverage.   Like the rest of the world, the U.S. is perilously dependent on China for the ingredients in critical drugs since those products are cheaper there and China is subject to fewer regulations. This puts the Chinese Communist Party in a pivotal role in controlling the supply chain of the world’s pharmaceuticals. About 80 percent of the active ingredients used in U.S. drugs are believed to come from China and India. Perhaps most dangerously, China is the only manufacturer of some generic antibiotics. Even India, which is responsible for about one-fifth of the world’s generic drug exports, receives most of its raw material imports from China. Due to Chinese supply chain disruptions under the coronavirus pandemic, India recently announced it will need to temporarily suspend exports of 26 essential drugs and drug ingredients, including some antibiotics. If China turned off its international pharmaceutical supply chain then “military hospitals and clinics would cease to function within months, if not days,” warned Rosemary Gibson, author of “China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America’s Dependence on China for Medicine.” Already, an article in the Xinhua state-run media agency considered a mouthpiece for the CCP hinted at holding back drugs from the U.S.  The article warned China had the ability to impose pharmaceutical export controls which could throw the U.S into “the mighty sea of coronavirus.” Sen. Marco Rubio said the Chinese warning proves China feels that during the coronavirus crisis “they can threaten to cut us off from our pharmaceutical supplies, they could trigger a domestic problem here that would make it difficult or us to confront them.” “It’s a tremendous amount of leverage,” Rubio said. Holly Strom and Kenneth Schell, both past presidents of the California State Pharmacy Board, documented: The FDA has identified roughly 20 drugs that are solely made in or derive their active pharmaceutical ingredients from China. The U.S. is partly reliant on Chinese raw ingredients for 370 medicines deemed “essential” by the World Health Organization. **According to one research study, the prices on pharmaceutical raw materials have grown by up to 50% since the outbreak began. Despite the well-publicized threat, reliance on Chinese medications has only increased in recent years. According to a U.S. government report released last year, U.S. imports of Chinese pharmaceutical materials grew by nearly one-quarter in 2017 from the prior year to nearly $4 billion. While it’s quite late in the game, several prominent U.S. lawmakers are now advocating for the U.S. to take back control of the drug industry.  Sen. Tom Cotton and Rep. Mike Gallagher introduced the  Protecting Our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain From China Act aimed at ending U.S. dependence on Chinese drugs. Among other things, the legislation offers incentives for manufactures to produce drugs domestically and requires federal entities to cut off the purchase of drugs with Chinese ingredients by 2025. 3 – China’s so-called debt diplomacy may bring it more control as Chinese coronavirus puts global economies into a tailspin.  China’s expansionist Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and other Chinese moves have long positioned China as a debt collector that can use the payments it is owed to influence those countries in its debt. With coronavirus causing worldwide economic turmoil, China may find itself with even more economic control over certain countries even though Beijing will take a big hit from its inability to collect debts. Azeem Ibrahim, research professor at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, took note of what he described as China’s “debt-based model of imperial control” and how the Chinese coronavirus outbreak could expand that influence. Ibrahim wrote: As these countries frantically attempt to manage the economic and financial consequences of the pandemic, they will struggle to service their debts to Beijing—which will expect more favors, and the ceding of more sovereignty, as the cost of debt relief. … Economic suffering is inevitable; as unemployment numbers grow and small businesses stare down the barrel of bankruptcy, it’s already arrived for many. Some may be more resilient than others, but dependent developing countries such as Liberia and Niger are going to be especially vulnerable. Their capacity to respond to the pandemic will be constrained by their relatively limited resources. And preexisting exposure to debt can put them in a real bind when forced to make choices between the lives of their citizens and becoming even more vulnerable to powerful creditors, most notably China. The role of debt in China’s expansion of its sphere of influence along the Belt and Road is already well documented and understood. So-called “debt-trap diplomacy” has already seen Sri Lanka effectively lose sovereign control of one port on the Indian Ocean. Djibouti, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Montenegro have all been identified as at risk of similarly losing sovereign control over areas of interest to China, as they all already owe more than 45 percent of their gross domestic products to Beijing over Belt and Road projects. In the spirit of never letting a crisis go to waste, there are indications China is already using the coronavirus pandemic to reposition its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a development strategy with focus on securing Chinese infrastructure projects in over 70 countries, including across Europe, Asia and Africa. China critics see the Belt and Road Initiative as a Trojan horse scheme to expand Chinese dominance globally, in part using a strategy of low bids to ensure successful tenders. In the wake of the pandemic, China is offering low-cost financing and special foreign exchange liquidity loans for companies involved the BRI, Beijing announced earlier this month. This as the BRI seems to have hit a short-term roadblock because many countries put a freeze on labor coming from China over fears the coronavirus could be spread. While some analysts say China’s massive international infrastructure project might actually take a short term knock from coronavirus, others believe the increased demand for Chinese cooperation on healthcare and virus response will open doors for BRI’s ultimate expansion. Matt Ferchen, head of global China research with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Germany, saw both sides of the coin on the BRI issue. “That China would see belt and road as a natural platform for extending such public diplomacy efforts, especially in developing countries, is not a surprise,” Ferchen remarked.
“The underlying contradiction, however, is that belt and road is a symbol of Chinese-led efforts at promoting the benefits of connectivity, while the virus has exposed the risks and weaknesses of connectivity on a global scale,” he said. 4. China seems to be implementing a post-virus strategy to gain ground from the U.S. As long as the U.S. economy remains in question, China will seek to take advantage in the perceived power vacuum created during the pandemic – likely at the expense of the U.S. “China has a long-standing strategic plan that’s focused on co-opting nodes and systems in which it thinks it can claim coercive power over the United States and the global system,” said Emily de La Bruyere, co-founder of Horizon Advisory, a consulting firm that tracks China. “Now that the world is shutting down, China sees its opportunity to move in much more quickly and aggressively to those nodes and systems.” “They have a post-virus strategy, and it is already underway,” added Nate Picarsic, the other co-founder of Horizon Advisory. Citing Chinese government and media sources, Horizon issued a report last week documenting “Beijing intends to reverse recent US efforts to counteract China’s subversive international presence; at the same time to chip away at US-Europe relations.” Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin penned a piece titled, “How China is planning to use the coronavirus crisis to its advantage.” “In Washington, there’s a lot of talk about how the coronavirus crisis could increase the push for more economic decoupling with China. But the Chinese government is thinking about it in exactly the opposite way. Beijing is preparing to use the crisis to advance China’s economic strategy against us. We better start taking notice,” Rogin warned. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"The embattled chief of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, took time out from combating the spread of the Chinese coronavirus on Saturday to take a telephone call from pop star Lady Gaga and offer her birthday greetings and thanks for her support. Tedros was effusive in his praise for the 33-year-old performer and her offers of strategic assistance to the globalist organization:   The exchange on social media came as Tedros faces calls to resign for allowing the Chinese Communist Party to influence WHO’s behavior during the viral epidemic now sweeping the world, as Breitbart News reported. A petition calling for Tedros’ resignation and Taiwan’s full membership in WHO can be viewed at Change.org, which reported 650,000 signatures as of Sunday morning. Criticism of WHO leadership at Taiwan News stretches back to February when an op-ed wondered why the organization was taking so long to declare a pandemic and a litany of obsequious remarks about China from top officials. Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and House Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) are among the American critics of Tedros’ performance. Cruz described the WHO director’s conduct as “deeply troubling” in a Twitter statement last Tuesday that linked to an article describing how Tedros got the job with extensive assistance from the Chinese Communist Party: It is deeply troubling @WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu is helping the Chinese Communist Party obfuscate the origins and trajectory of #COVID19, at the risk of health around the globe.https://t.co/gobeAmq7Pd — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) March 25, 2020  The Daily Caller article referenced by Cruz noted that Tedros “worked closely with China during his time as Ethiopia’s health minister,” won the election to become WHO director “despite widely covered accusations that he covered up three different cholera epidemics as health minister in Ethiopia,” was shamed out of tapping the monstrous Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe to be a “goodwill ambassador” to the U.N. as a favor to Beijing, and is not even a medical doctor, although he has training in infectious disease response. Senator Rubio and Rep. McCaul were quoted criticizing Tedros in a RealClearPolitics piece on Thursday. Rubio joined Cruz in labeling the director’s performance as “deeply disturbing.” “The actions of the Chinese Communist Party exacerbated the public health crisis plaguing the international community, and instead of prioritizing global health, Dr. Tedros and the WHO played favoritism to China,” said Rubio. For her part, Lady Gaga announced Tuesday she will delay the release of her sixth studio album Chromatica as a result of the epidemic, telling fans that it would not feel right to release it “with all that is going on during this global pandemic.” In a post on social media, the singer – whose real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta – explained she would prefer people to prioritize the purchase of essential goods such as food and medicine over her music. Gaga is not the only musician who has had to make changes amid the global pandemic. As Breitbart News reported, other artists including Madonna, Khalid, Billie Eilish, and the South Korean boyband BTS have all had to either postpone or outright cancel their upcoming tours to help prevent the virus’s spread.",WHO Chief Sends Lady Gaga Birthday Greetings and Praise for Coronavirus ‘Support’,2020-03-29,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/29/who-chief-sends-lady-gaga-birthday-greetings-and-praise-for-coronavirus-support/,Breitbart

"President Trump’s Department of Homeland Security released updated guidelines naming gun manufacturers and retailers as essential on Saturday, which means they are to stay open and operational nationwide during a Chinese coronavirus shutdown. The DHS guidelines list as essential: The Second Amendment Foundation’s Alan Gottlieb commented on the DHS declaration, saying, “Every freedom loving American owes President Trump and his administration a very big thank you for protecting our Second Amendment Rights. This is another Trump promise made and promise kept.” The DHS declaration comes just days after Governor Phil Murphy (D) laughed in the face of a man who expressed concern that the statewide shutdown in New Jersey had put an end to gun sales, thereby eliminating the ability to get a firearm for self-defense. Breitbart News reported the concerned man asking Murphy, “If less guns reduce crime, will you give up your personal bodyguards?” Murphy responded by intimating that he and the citizen had a philosophical difference in the role guns play, with the governor believing “a safer society has fewer guns, not more guns. And the guns that do exist are in the hands of the right people — particularly trained members of law enforcement.” The governor then giggled, referenced an armed law enforcement member next to him, and said, “It is what it is.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"When Virgil thinks about President Donald Trump vs. Rep. Thomas Massie, he thinks back to a famous moment in Roman history—63 BC, to be precise—when the great statesman, Cicero, stood up on the floor of the Roman Senate to denounce a fellow senator, Catiline, for plotting to undermine the Republic. A famous painting from the 19th century tells the tale—and it was a tale that ended badly for Catiline.  Cicero Denouncing Catiline (Cesare Maccari/Public Domain) Now, more than 2,000 years later, Trump—having epically denounced everyone from Hillary Clinton to Nancy Pelosi to Adam Schiff to Mitt Romney—is at it again, and with good reason. On March 27, the object of presidential ire was Massie, who took it upon himself to delay passage of the CARES Act, the lifeline the economy needs in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.   That legislation was so important that every member of Congress, in both parties, in both chambers, was on board with allowing it to pass on an emergency basis—even if he or she might have personally opposed it. That was the case, for example, for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She was as strongly against the bill as anyone, calling it “shameful,” and yet even she didn’t seek to block it. That was also the case with another Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan, who went “crazy” on the House floor, in the words of Breitbart News’s Hannah Bleau. Yet still, Stevens, “panicked” as she was—she had to be angrily gaveled down by her fellow Democrats—agreed to the passage of the bill.  In other words, Massie was alone—the only lawmaker who wished to obstruct the CARES Act. He might think that his action makes him a hero, but most others think it makes him, well, to put it mildly, a bad lawmaker. It’s all well and good for someone to say that his or her conscience dictates a certain course of action, no matter how lonely or solitary it might be. And yet it’s questionable whether a conscience-stricken solo artist should be in a legislature at all. Lawmaking is, of course, by definition, a group activity.   And as for any deliberative body, the goal of a legislature is to get things done—or, as they say, to make the sausage—and so maybe a self-absorbed prima donna ought to find another line of work. Perhaps somewhere there’s a job for Massie in which he can just stare into a mirror and trill to his own moral superiority. Under the headline, “Thomas Massie’s forced coronavirus vote is irresponsible,” the Washington Examiner’s Kaylee McGhee made the real-world conservative case against Massie’s dereliction of duty. McGhee agreed with much of Massie’s critique of specific porky provisions in the bill, and yet as she put it, “The coronavirus relief bill is not perfect. It might not even be good. But it is better than nothing. And given a choice, most people would prefer inadequate help to no help at all.” Once again, that’s the nature of politics. And it’s true that politics, being made by human beings, will never be pure enough for a purist.  So if one’s precious conscience doesn’t agree with the political truism, “Half a loaf is better than none,” that’s fine—but maybe the “precious” ought to find something else to do.   The real problem with Massie, McGhee continued, was the sheer perverseness of his position. That is, Massie wasn’t seeking to persuade anyone—he was simply making a shrieking statement of his own contempt for Congress, and for the national interest. Once again, other Americans might think that way, too, but as a Member of Congress (at least for now), Massie certainly can’t expect to get anything done for the people he was elected to serve. As McGhee concluded,  This roll-call vote is irresponsible for several reasons, the most obvious being that it forces representatives to abandon isolation and group together in direct violation of health officials’ social distancing guidelines. Some representatives have tested positive for COVID-19, and others have remained self-quarantined out of respect for their other colleagues.  Massie is now callously undermining the caution this pandemic demands. Yes, that Massie is a piece of work. But why not take it from The Man himself? On the 27th, Trump denounced Massie in an epic tweet-storm:  Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress.  He just wants the publicity.  He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous . . . & costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn’t their fault. It is “HELL” dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the “big picture” done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party! Of course, thanks to Trump’s prodding, the compromise bill passed, with Massie sitting in his own pouty Catiline corner.   Later that day, as he signed the legislation in the Oval Office, Trump laid out the stakes in another tweet: “We are marshaling the full power of government and society to achieve victory over the virus. Together, we will endure, we will prevail, and we will WIN! #CARESAct.” Trump has the right tone here: This is a war, and we must win it. In the meantime, people on the front lines of the fight—in the emergency rooms—are working hard and paying a heavy price; it’s estimated that fully a fifth of those suffering from COVID-19 are EMTs, nurses, and doctors. Together, these brave health workers form a national honor battalion—and by not honoring them, Massie has dishonored himself. So yes, in a vital war, good citizens—including politicians—must get with the war effort. To do otherwise is to be a bad citizen, a shirker, or worse. And as for useless politicians, well . . .  they might lose their seat.  Speaking of losing a seat in a vainglorious pose, Massie might wish to acquaint himself with the story of Rep. Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who holds the dubious distinction of being the only member of Congress to vote “nay” on the 1941 declaration of war against Japan, in the wake of Pearl Harbor. Yes, the vote was unanimous—save for Rankin playing the lone naysayer. Indeed, we could even say that Jeannette Rankin was the Tom Massie of her time. (Rankin lost her seat, of course, in the next election.)  Interestingly, late on the 27th, the Republican Jewish Coalition—which rarely involves itself in GOP primaries—announced that it was supporting Massie’s primary opponent this year. That opponent would be Todd McMurtry, a conservative lawyer who represented Nick Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School teenager who in 2019 was falsely accused of . . .  something (or was it everything?) by the Main Stream Media.  In other words, McMurtry worked effectively to turn the tables on the MSM; from now on, arrogant reporters will have to be more careful about smearing ordinary kids from the Heartland.    So we can see, McMurtry has done something genuinely constructive. And he pledges to work with Donald Trump, as well as with his fellow Kentuckian Mitch McConnell, along with other problem-solvers. Surely, that’s the sort of servant-leadership the people of Kentucky’s Fourth Congressional District want—and deserve. Oh, and one last thing: Catiline, the ancient conspirator against the Roman Republic, died a violent death shortly after Cicero denounced him. He wasn’t missed.   Of course, in our time, Virgil would never wish physical harm on anyone. Yet he, and many others, would be happy to see Massie safely retired from politics. And more importantly, so would the Commander-in-Chief.",Virgil: Rep.

"Clint Phillips, the CEO of telehealth company Medici, told Breitbart News Saturday that President Donald Trump’s telehealth reform has given 100 million Americans access to virtual care. The Trump administration expanded Medicare telehealth coverage that will enable beneficiaries to receive a broader range of healthcare services from their doctors. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved a waiver that temporarily pays clinicians to provide telehealth services for beneficiaries. Medicaid recipients could receive access to the plan if a state government would approve the reform. President Trump also signed a coronavirus-related bill in March that would provide $500 million to help clinicians expand telehealth services. Phillips said that the reform increased virtual healthcare access for over 100 million Americans. He said that this is “a big game-changer that the Trump administration has put forward, which is just huge for healthcare innovation, for people getting care. Over 100 million people have access to virtual care because of what the White House and the Trump administration have put out. Doctors can get paid for virtual care for Medicare.”  Phillips said that the reform has dramatically increased demand for telehealth services. “We’ve grown about 16-fold in less than two weeks. So we have had to double, quadruple, the servers,” the Medici CEO noted. He added that they are “hiring frantically” to keep up with the demand for telehealth services. Phillips noted that Medici offers text-based translation services so that could patients and doctors can speak to each other if they do not speak the same language. He added that the patients could “rate” their visits with their doctors that physicians can receive feedback on their healthcare services. Trump has previously worked to expand telehealth services through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Trump’s telehealth reform has been lauded by CMS Administrator Seema Verma and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). In 2017, then-VA Secretary David Shulkin said that Trump moved to expand video technology and diagnostic tools to conduct medical exams. He said that veterans would be able to use mobile devices to schedule or cancel appointments with a VA doctor. Phillips said that the telehealth reform has served as a boon for patients and doctors across the country. “The last few weeks have been incredible because of the changes to the law because of coronavirus that has led virtual care to just explode.,” he said.

"Former Donald Trump administration staffer and Pennsylvania’s Eighth Congressional District candidate Jim Bognet told Breitbart News Saturday that it is “inexcusable” that freshman Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) has been playing “politics” with Congress’s response package. On Friday, the House passed a historic coronavirus relief package after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) spent days holding up the legislation. During that time, she was pushing her own coronavirus bill. Republicans such as Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) slammed Pelosi’s political stunt, noting that it was jeopardizing Americans’ health by delaying crucial aid to hospitals, businesses, and Americans afflicted by the coronavirus outbreak. Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle noted that Cartwright did not “speak up” about Pelosi’s stunt and that Americans could have received aid much faster if the Democrats “did not play games.” Bognet said that Cartwright did not do anything to block Pelosi’s political games, calling the Democrats’ stunt “inexcusable.” Bognet told Breitbart News Saturday “Cartwright is part of her leadership. They’ve been playing politics for years, and they will keep playing politics at a time of crisis, and it was embarrassing this pork that they tried to throw in at a time of national emergency. We should be rushing to help people at the front lines: the doctors, the nurses, FEMA, and instead, we are playing political games. It’s unconscionable and inexcusable.”  Bognet also said that the Chinese communist party has been lying about the number of coronavirus cases the country has and that China must pay for unleashing the pandemic on the world. “When we go through this crisis, they need to be held to account for what they’ve done to the world,” he said.

"Despite mass unemployment of Americans during the Chinese coronavirus crisis, federal agencies are accelerating the speed at which foreign workers will be imported to the United States to take blue-collar industry jobs. This week, the federal government announced that nearly 3.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment as businesses have been forced to close due to the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. from Wuhan, China. The 3,283,000 jobless Americans due to the coronavirus crisis far surpass the 1982 record of 695,000 jobless claims, and the number of unemployed is expected to continue to surge. Despite mass unemployment, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Chad Wolf will fast-track foreign workers on H-2A and H-2B visas into the U.S. to take blue-collar agricultural and nonagricultural jobs. A memo released by Pompeo reads: The H-2 program is essential to the economy and food security of the United States and is a national security priority. Therefore, we intend to continue processing H-2 cases as much as possible, as permitted by post resources and local government restrictions. Secretary Pompeo, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, has authorized consular officers to expand the categories of H-2 visa applicants whose applications can be adjudicated without an in-person interview.  Consular officers can, if they so choose, now waive the visa interview requirement for first-time and returning H-2 applicants who have no apparent ineligibility or potential ineligibility. [Emphasis added] This expansion also increases the period in which returning workers may qualify for an interview waiver. Applicants whose previous visas expired in the last 48 months, and who did not require a waiver of ineligibility the last time they applied, do not need to be interviewed in-person if they are applying for the same visa classification as their previous visa.  We anticipate the vast majority of otherwise qualified H-2 applicants will now be adjudicated without an interview. [Emphasis added] The directive effectively allows agricultural and nonagricultural businesses to quickly import foreign workers on H-2A and H-2B visas without standard interview and application procedures — a move that echoes President George W. Bush’s decision to waive visa requirements in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. “The agriculture industry’s dependence on poorly screened, cheap foreign labor to produce our food is indefensible,” Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) RJ Hauman told Breitbart News. “Validating it through a guest worker policy change at a time of mass unemployment and a public health crisis is an enormous mistake.” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue praised Pompeo’s decision to waive visa requirements in a statement, claiming the American economy hinges on foreign workers: Temporarily waiving in-person interviews for H-2 visa applicants streamlines the application process and helps provide steady labor for the agriculture sector during this time of uncertainty. H-2 labor is vital to the economy and food security of America – our farmers and producers depend on these workers to continue to feed and clothe the world. [Emphasis added] Officials with NumbersUSA, which represents American workers, blasted the decision by Pompeo and Wolf. “Low-wage foreign guest workers can also come in by the tens of thousands thanks to [Chad Wolf],” NumbersUSA officials wrote on Twitter. “Will every individual be tested for coronavirus or does corporate greed trump public health?” .@DHS_Wolf has now waived in-person interviews for H-2 (ag and seasonal non-ag) guest workers. This includes employees for landscaping, restaurant, and hotel industries. Not only does this add insult to injured American workers, it threatens public health. — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 27, 2020  The Agriculture Dept. is making it easier for employers to replace Americans with foreign guest workers amid the coronavirus crisis. This is what happens when lobbyists for the Ag industry like  Kristi Boswell run policy. Americans go jobless and public health is threatened. — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 27, 2020  Last year, farm companies hired roughly 250,000 H-2A foreign workers as there is no cap on the number of H-2A workers who can be imported into the U.S. This month, Wolf approved 35,000 extra H-2B foreign workers to take nonagricultural jobs in the American economy and has refused to halt the program amid the coronavirus crisis. Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut.

"Whatever you think about President Trump and his response to this global pandemic that sparked from a Chinese “wet market” selling wildlife, you cannot exactly be heartened to behold the response offered by Democrats. The party’s presumed nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, finally mounted the barricades this week to personally combat the Wuhan virus by — what else? — setting up a television studio in his Delaware home to offer “counterprogramming” to the president and his crisis team of doctors, public health officials, industry leaders, and economic experts. Watching Mr. Biden stumble, mumble and dodder through a simple speech in his living room while looking lost and lonely staring into a cold camera is physically painful for any human. For nearly five decades, Mr. Biden has been one of the great masters of Washington. Yet he is a blubbering disaster unfit for the national stage during a crisis. Unfit, really, for any stage at any time. He is Barack Obama — minus the fake Greek columns. Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress cannot help but reveal their true loyalties in the desperate throes of a global meltdown. More Americans have lost their jobs in the past several weeks than at any other point in history, and what is the first instinct of panicked Democrats in Washington? They race to lard up an emergency financial rescue package with treasonous smash-and-grab bags of obscene money for the greedy special interest groups that keep Democrats in power. From environmental wackos to self-serving union bosses to the suicidal open borders industry, the great puppeteers of Washington Democrats were the party’s first — and only — priority in this panic. Workers be damned! Taxpayers be screwed! Damn the greatest economic engine on the earth! This really should not be much of a surprise if you look back at their performance these past several years. Since the dawn of the Trump Dynasty, Democrats have manufactured ridiculous crisis after ridiculous crisis. Russian hookers peeing on a bed in a Moscow hotel room. Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh a serial gang rapist. Ukraine Kabuki impeachment. These people are fundamentally unserious. Totally untrustworthy. Genetically anti-American. And nothing reveals their unseriousness like an actual, true crisis. Perhaps the most obvious and cynical way Democrats in Washington exposed themselves during this pandemic was their nakedly partisan effort to expand — of all things — “voting from home” in the massive bailout bill. Also known as “ballot harvesting,” this scheme strips away every safeguard designed to ensure election integrity in America. After all, this is the same party that managed to lose an election to President Trump. The only way they have any hope of winning is to entirely rig the whole thing. There is also talk in Washington these days of doing something just as bad as ballot harvesting. Some people want to allow congressmen and senators to be allowed to cast ballots from anywhere. These people are bad enough being allowed to vote while in Washington. Why on earth would we want to encourage them by allowing them to vote from home, too? The whole point of establishing the nation’s capital in Washington was that it was a dismal swamp uninhabitable most of the year. The mosquitoes alone kept Congress out of session for long months at a time. This narrowed the amount of time each year that federal legislators could be in Washington wasting your money and destroying the country with their ridiculous ideas and votes. Then along came air conditioning, and that ruined everything. One of the rare bright spots in this whole pandemic has been that — finally — Mitt Romney found a job for which he is actually qualified: self-quarantine. It’s just too bad he didn’t think of that back in 2012 before Republicans nominated him to run against Mr. Obama. Maybe if he had, Republicans could have nominated a real leader — a real statesman — like Donald Trump. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com or @charleshurt on Twitter.",Charles Hurt: Doddering Joe Biden Unfit to Lead in Time of Crisis,2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/28/charles-hurt-doddering-joe-biden-unfit-to-lead-in-time-of-crisis/,Breitbart

"Digital media platform Amaze has launched an at-home sex ed video series on Facebook that teaches children home from school during the coronavirus crisis that watching porn is normal. In an email sent to subscribers, Amaze announced: In light of COVID-19, we’re rolling out an at-home sex ed series via our Facebook page. Every weekday we’ll share helpful videos, infographics, and resources to help spark important conversations at home. This week we’re all about general framing to prepare you for conversations, and then in forthcoming weeks we’ll dig deeper into specific topics. Also, be sure to check out My AMAZE custom playlists (which offer a great way to engage with kids at home!) and our parent resources.  Amaze touts it offers children “medically accurate” and “age-appropriate” information. Among the organization’s offerings for at-home sex ed is a new series called #AskAMAZE. “Our first video covers the much asked question, is it normal to watch porn?” Amaze announces, and, in the video, answers the question with a resounding “Yes!”  “Lots of people watch porn,” the narrator continues. “After all, it’s right there and it’s free. And anyway, many people are curious about this sex stuff.” The only negative aspect of porn Amaze mentions in the video is that “porn is not real.” “It’s just a fantasy like superheroes movies,” the narrator explains. “Bodies don’t look like those in porn movies.” A partner of International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), which promotes comprehensive sex education (CSE), Amaze.org describes itself as a platform that desires young people to be “supported and affirmed” and envisions a world in which “the adults in their lives communicate openly and honestly with them about puberty, reproduction, relationships, sex and sexuality.” On Amaze’s website is a New York Times op-ed by Peggy Orenstein from March 2016 that assails abstinence or risk-avoidance sex education, the public health approach to sex ed. “President Obama is trying – finally – in his 2017 budget to remove all federal funding for abstinence education,” Orenstein wrote, advocating for speaking to children often about sex, to “normalize” it, and “integrate it into everyday life.” In a post about Amaze’s new sex ed at-home series, Massachusetts Family Institute (MFI) observed: Is this what amaze.org considers “honest sex education?” Telling kids that it’s perfectly normal to watch porn doesn’t sound medically accurate or age-appropriate to me, and researchers agree. Studies have shown that porn is highly addictive and has negative and detrimental effects on the brain and behaviors of youth. MFI notes that Culture Reframed, an organization that addresses hypersexualized media and pornography as “the public health crisis of the digital age,” asserts boys exposed to porn are more inclined to adopt attitudes that normalize sexual harassment and violence toward women. Similarly, girls exposed to porn are increasingly likely to participate in high-risk sexual behavior and develop problems such as eating disorders and drug abuse. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) also observes children exposed to porn are inclined to engage in sex at younger ages, opening them up to higher risk of developing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and pregnancy. Like risk-avoidance sex ed, NCOSE advocates for a “public health approach” to pornography. Such an approach has proven “effective with other major problems from smoking, to lead poisoning, to HIV/AIDS,” the organization states. “Leadership and an investment are needed in a multi-disciplined, multi-pronged approach to be effective against a well-funded industry in order to prevent and combat the harms.”",At-Home Sex Ed Digital Media Teaches Children Watching Porn Is Normal,2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/28/at-home-sex-ed-digital-media-teaches-children-watching-porn-is-normal/,Breitbart
"Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday that the Democrats’ delay of the economic relief package hurt small businesses in his own district, which is being ravaged by the coronavirus. Zeldin said his district, the 1st Congressional district in New York, has been “crushed” with positive cases and added that hospitals are nearing capacity. The Democrats’ delay — rejecting the initial bipartisan coronavirus relief package — only served to hurt business owners and individuals, especially in his district. “And just to put a perspective of the consequence of the delay: One example is I woke up this morning and had multiple people reaching out to me asking about the small business loan and forgiveness program, and where do they go to apply,” he said, noting that many business owners are trying to decide if they need to close permanently and adding that some already have. “There are businesses, because of a delay over the course of the week, there are businesses that are out that — if Congress just moved quickly and passed this on Monday — as a product, as you point out, of bipartisan agreement, because it was Senate Republicans working with Senate Democrats — fast forward to this morning with these people reaching out to me. I’d be able to send them to a link,” he said. “They would have already been in touch with lenders, filling out applications. Every moment that goes by matters. Hospitals making decisions on money available to purchase PPE. States and local governments, especially states that are looking to acquire ventilators and whatnot.” Zeldin said the federal government has been helping but added that the delay had a negative impact. “This delay hurt,” he continued. “The Speaker’s plane landed in DC and she blew everything up,” he said of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who, along with her caucus, offered their own version of an economic relief bill fraught with progressive agenda items unrelated to the crisis. “And it’s amazing hearing them talk about items that were in the bill on Sunday as if the delay somehow secured those components,” he added. The lawmaker said he would have taken no issue with delaying a bill to strengthen it, but that was not the case with the Democrats. “But if you’re going to put up your own bill, it’s going to be filled up with liberal wish list fantasy items that have nothing to do with coronavirus, that’s what you’re delaying it for? That’s what — you know the downtown in my district that is going to lose a few more businesses this week because of your push for ballot harvesting? Give me a break. This is not that moment. That’s for some other debate on some other day in some other bill.”  The bipartisan bill, which Trump signed on Friday, provides relief to small businesses, hospitals, and individuals. “Because of the loan that is being made available, they are going to have a process in place to be able to pay what they owe, to be able to maintain a headcount and on the backend of it, because of a loan forgiveness program, be able to get the loan forgiven and still be in business,” Zeldin said of the bill. “And this was a successful business through no fault of their own. The government closed them down.” He also noted that the measure provides assistance for hospitals, which need to invest in PPE and increased bed space, as well as assistance for state and local governments. “We should not include anything in the bill that is not related to coronavirus,” he stressed. “If you’re firing off a $2 trillion bullet, you can make an argument that our federal government doesn’t have a $2 trillion bullet to fire, but we are firing one anyway to get these small businesses through what we’re going through,” Zeldin said, emphasizing that the small businesses the bill helps have been hurt through no fault of their own. “This was a government decision that closed down these businesses. And government is trying to help them get through the other side. And government’s capable of really screwing it up or actually providing assistance,” he said. As for his state, Zeldin said hospitals are currently working on increasing bed capacity, highlighting the United States Army Corps of Engineers building a temporary hospital, as well as the state receiving thousands of ventilators from FEMA. “That kind of cooperation is essential. Listen, President Trump and Gov. Cuomo, they might battle on issues in the past, they might battle on issues in the future, but we’re not Democrats or Republicans here. We’re Americans,” he said, adding that Americans need to root for both of them to be successful.",Lee Zeldin: Democrats Delay of Coronavirus Relief Bill Hurt Small Businesses,2020-03-28,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/28/lee-zeldin-democrats-delay-of-coronavirus-relief-bill-hurt-small-businesses/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump on Saturday sent off the medical ship USNS Comfort from Norfolk, VA, to New York City to assist in the battle with the coronavirus.

The president described the ship as a “70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity” to the people of New York that was “stocked to the brim” with medical equipment. “We’re here for you, we’re fighting for you, and we are with you all the way, and always will be,” Trump said. “You have the unwavering support of the entire nation.” The USNS Comfort will arrive in New York City on Monday.

In an televised interview on Good Morning Britain, Mayor Khan was asked by host Sussana Reid: “Can you see a situation in which a sort of metaphorical ring of steel is put around London in order not to spread the virus, in the same way that we’ve seen has happened in Wuhan in China?” Khan insisted he could not foresee such a situation — which has now unfolded in Finland, for example, where Helsinki and the capital region are sealed off from the rest of the country — and claimed that plans were in place were to “contain the virus, to delay it’s spreading”. Reid pressed her point, however, asking him: “at what point will you say to people, in this containment, or even in the next delay stage, look, being in public transport is obviously a risk factor, people are coughing and sneezing on a crowded Tube carriage, that is going to put you at risk — you know, people might be saying [to Khan] now, as mayor of the city, should we still be getting on public transport and using the tubes?” “Well, it’s very important that we don’t spread panic or alarm based on misinformation,” the Labour politician replied. “What we need to do as politicians is to rely upon the best advice we have from the public health experts and from the Chief Medical Officer — there is no risk in using the Tube or buses or other forms of public transport, or going to a concert,” he insisted.   Sadiq Khan: ‘Covid-19 Is Not a Chinese Virus’, Trump ‘Disgraceful’ https://t.co/Fpj1NXRsO3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2020  “Mr Mayor, no disrespect, but how on earth can you say that in a city of 12 million people there is ‘no risk’ given that we now know it’s here and is beginning to spread here and we know that in other countries the spread has been ferocious — places like Italy, Iran, and others,” interrupted Piers Morgan, Reid’s co-host. “How can you say as Mayor of London there is ‘no risk’ to people using public transport?” “Because I rely on the advice I receive from Public Health England and the Chief Medical Officer,” Khan shot back, referring for a second time to top technocrat Professor Chris Witty — who is now in self-isolation with coronavirus symptoms himself. “[T]he advice is you’re not going to catch if you’re washing your hands regularly and if you’re using public transport,” Khan continued. “On the Tube on a daily basis there are five million journeys, on our buses six million journeys, many of the concert venues in London have crowds of between 5,000 and 20,000,” he added — although without explaining why the statistics he provided would suggest anything but very strong potential for the London transport network to become a critical vector for the virus, despite his claims to the contrary.

Now, London has emerged as the British epicentre for coronavirus, with hospitals saying the fear being overwhelmed and the Tube network much reduced due to the fact that, as Khan himself reported in The Telegraph on March 28th, “nearly a third of our TfL staff are now off sick or self-isolating themselves.” Khan used that Telegraph article to plead with “more people to stay at home to ensure our critical workers can travel safely” on the Tube, with the reduction in service meaning that the remaining trains are often still crowded. It is not right to direct selective outrage at workers for crowded tubes & trains when their frequency has been cut & many operators have reduced the number of carriages on each train.

"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The streets of Stockholm are quiet but not deserted. People still sit at outdoor cafes in the center of Sweden’s capital. Vendors still sell flowers. Teenagers still chat in groups in parks. Some still greet each other with hugs and handshakes. After a long, dark Scandinavian winter, the coronavirus pandemic is not keeping Swedes at home even while citizens in many parts of the world are sheltering in place and won’t find shops or restaurants open on the few occasions they are permitted to venture out. Swedish authorities have advised the public to practice social distancing and to work from home, if possible, and urged those over age 70 to self-isolate as a precaution. Yet compared to the lockdowns imposed elsewhere in the world, the government’s response to the virus allows a liberal amount of personal freedom. Standing at bars has been banned in Sweden, but restaurant customers can still be served at tables instead of having to take food to go. High schools and universities are closed, but preschools and primary schools are still running classes in person. “Sweden is an outlier on the European scene, at least,” said Johan Giesecke, the country’s former chief epidemiologist and now adviser to the Swedish Health Agency, a government body. “And I think that’s good.” Email Leaks Show Experts Slamming Swedish Govt for Not Taking Virus Seriously Enough https://t.co/iq1reoPYNB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 22, 2020  Other European nations “have taken political, unconsidered actions” instead of ones dictated by science, Giesecke asserted. It remains unclear how long Sweden’s exceptional state will last. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, warning of “many tough weeks and months ahead,” announced Friday that as of Sunday, gatherings would be limited to 50 people instead of 500. The government noted that weddings, funerals and Easter celebrations would be affected. Still, to reduce the spread of the virus in Germany and the U.K., groups larger than two are currently prohibited unless they are composed of people who already live together. Officials in Italy and France introduced increasingly restrictive limits on public activities and eventually authorized fines because they said too many people ignored social distancing recommendations. For now, the Swedish government maintains that citizens can be trusted to exercise responsibility for the greater good and will stay home if they experience any COVID-19 symptoms. Many Swedes are indeed keeping the recommended distance from others. Victoria Holmgren, 24, praised the Swedish government´s handling of the public health crisis as “very good.” “And it’s partly because I don’t think I could manage being inside the whole day,” Holmgren said. But some scientists have criticized the Swedish Public Health Agency’s approach as irresponsible during a worldwide pandemic that has already killed over 21,000 people in Europe. In an open letter to the government, some 2,000 academics called for greater transparency and more justification for its infection prevention strategy. Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Karolinska Institute, a prominent medical university in Sweden, said the concern centers on “the assessments and the course that the Swedish government has taken through this epidemic, and especially because there is really a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies.” Linnarsson compared Sweden’s handling of the virus to letting a kitchen fire burn with the intent of extinguishing it later. “That doesn’t make any sense. And the danger, of course, is that it burns the whole house down,” he said. Sweden Not Prepared For Major Coronavirus Outbreak Says Whistle-blower Doctor https://t.co/IvSkpJ9i1U — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 26, 2020  Sweden’s current chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, argued that even if the country’s comparatively permissive policies are an anomaly, they are more sustainable and effective in protecting the public’s health than “drastic” moves like closing schools for four or five months. Sweden, a nation of 10 million, had a total of 3,447 confirmed virus cases and and 105 deaths by Sunday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. However, there has been limited testing, with some 24,500 tests conducted by Wednesday, according to official statistics. “The goal is to slow down the amount of new people getting infected so that health care gets a reasonable chance to take care of them. And that’s what we all do in every country in Europe,” Tegnell said. “We just choose different methods to do it.” Susanna Moberg, a 63-year-old retired teacher, said she trusted the government and also believes Sweden´s experience with the virus will not be as dire as Italy’s, which has by far the most virus-related deaths in the world at more than 10,000. “I’m not so worried. I’m not 70 years yet. And my children are not sick so we will go to a restaurant on Sunday,” Moberg said. “We said `Everybody is well and the restaurant is open.´ So we will go there to celebrate. We can’t stay at home the whole day, all week.” ___ Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, contributed to this report.

"The scientific adviser who called for Italy’s lockdown says Britain was ten days too late in doing the same to have a significant impact on the outbreak and, as a result, is now at risk of having a worse coronavirus infection rate than his own country. Professor Walter Ricciardi, a World Health Organization (WHO) expert and scientific adviser for the Italian government, told Sky News that the United Kingdom had the advantage of seeing how the deadly pandemic played out in his home country and should have acted sooner as a result. He gave the example of seeing crowded trains on the London Underground in recent weeks when Italy was already aware of how dangerous that kind of close contact during a pandemic can be. When asked when Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have locked down Britain Prof Ricciardi said: “I would say, at least ten days ago.” “Having had the example of Italy, the UK could have adopted [the strategy] much earlier,” he said, remarking that the cases which have been transmitted in the past ten days would not have been as a result of a sooner lockdown. “When we scientists put the evidence on your table, you should take action,” Prof Ricciardi added, warning: “When you take this position later than possible, you pay a price in sick people and in deaths. Certainly, this is something that could have been avoided.” Coronavirus: Sadiq Khan Insisted Crowded Tube Posed 'No Risk' on March 3rd https://t.co/vvl9nDTmfA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2020  The doctor added that the delay in locking down the country had actually resulted in the possibility of the current national quarantine being longer than it otherwise should have been, saying the duration could be “at least one month but I guess it could be even longer”. Britain is thought to be around two weeks behind the curve from Italy, which is the worst-hit nation in the world, officially with fatalities surpassing those put out by the government of the China, where the coronavirus originated. While the British government’s advisers claim that the National Health Service (NHS) is within capacity to cope with the worst of the virus, thanks to the lockdown and an increase in staff and ICU beds, the country is still vastly short on life-saving equipment, notably ventilators, which industrialists are rushing to produce in the coming weeks. Deaths in Britain continue to climb, with London and Gwent, Wales the worst-hit regions. One hospital specialist said that London clinics are experiencing “tsunamis” of coronavirus patients, warning that the capital city’s hospitals could be overwhelmed in “days”.

"TORONTO (AP) – Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife said Saturday that she has recovered from being ill from Covid-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus. “I am feeling so much better,” Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said in a statement on social media. She said she received the clearance from her doctor and Ottawa Public Health. Trudeau’s office announced on March 12 that she had tested positive for the coronavirus after she fell ill upon returning from a trip to London. The prime minister and his family have been in self-isolation at home since then. He and their three children didn’t show symptoms. Justin Trudeau has been giving daily news conferences outside his residence. He said earlier Saturday that his wife was in fine form. “From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out to me with their well wishes. And to everyone who is suffering right now, I send you all my love,” she said. Looks like Justin Trudeau has some explaining to do. https://t.co/ZHFXhjtUHB — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 26, 2020  The prime minister suggested Saturday that he would continue to work from home to set an example for Canadians who are being asked to stay at home. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, meanwhile, said Saturday that it is prohibiting gatherings of five people or more. The order was effective immediately and replaced one that prohibited public events of over 50 people. It does not apply to households with five or more people, and funerals will be permitted with up to 10 people at one time. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said if the virus is to be stopped, extraordinary measures are needed to ensure physical distancing. The province has already closed all nonessential services. Quebec announced police checkpoints in eight regions outside the province’s major cities where the population is deemed more at risk. Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault said that only essential travel will be allowed in those areas and that provincial police have also set up checkpoints near the Canada-U.S. border to intercept snowbirds coming back to Quebec to ensure they understand there is a 14-day quarantine. Canada has more than 5,616 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 61 deaths. About 445 people have recovered. Why has Canada already run out of basic medical equipment, like face masks? Because Trudeau sent it all to China as “foreign aid” just a few weeks ago.

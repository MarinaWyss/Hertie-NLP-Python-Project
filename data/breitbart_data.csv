"A group of Conservative party grandees will seek to pass legislation to make Huawei involvement in British telecoms networks illegal, over fears the Chinese may use the equipment to spy on the United Kingdom. Former Cabinet ministers including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, and Owen Paterson will submit an amendment to Boris Johnson’s Telecoms Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill on Tuesday. It would seek to ensure that no equipment provided by companies deemed “high-risk vendors” by the National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), are used in Britain’s communication networks from after December 31st, 2022. Currently, BT, O2, EE, Vodafone, and Three are all using Huawei in the United Kingdom. Tory rebels speaking to the Financial Times said that as many as 40 to 60 MPs could back them, which could be enough to defeat the vote on the government’s bill. Another said that, currently, the number is closer to an ineffectual 20. While the rebel leaders represent the right-wing European Research Group (ERG) faction, there is also support from “centrist” SO-CALLED One Nation Tories such as Tom Tugendhat. There is also opposition to Huawei from the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party (SNP). Top Tory: Huawei Deal Worst Govt Decision Since MI6 Hired Soviet Spy https://t.co/a5PdzchRW1 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2020  According to The Guardian, an insider said the move is the first in a “guerilla” campaign to force Downing Street to rethink its decision. In January, Prime Minister Johnson announced that he would be giving the go-ahead to allow the Chinese firm to assist developing the British 5G network, against the security advice of Five Eyes security alliance partners Australia and the United States. Assertions that Huawei would only be working on the “non-core” elements and be limited to 35 per cent of the work has not assuaged the concerns of British politicians and security specialists. Last month, Nigel Farage warned that Huawei involvement could threaten intelligence-sharing with allies, a future trade deal with the U.S., and even pose a risk to NATO. MPs discussed Huawei’s involvement in 5G during a debate in Westminster Hall on Wednesday, with Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, calling the decision to allow “effectively a state-owned corporation in the People’s Republic of China under the Communist Party” access to Britain’s 5G network “ridiculous”, comparing it to coopering with Nazis on British radar development just before the war. He said: “Imagine that in 1939 we had been developing our radar systems and decided to have one of the Nazi companies in Germany directly involved. Oh, but we reduced their involvement to 35 per cent, so they only controlled 35 per cent. I wonder how ridiculous that would have seemed.” Report: Chinese Army Stole Over 13 Million British Citizens’ Personal Data https://t.co/ImQe4loOI8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2020  The Brexiteer Tory also said the figure of 35 per cent had been “plucked from thin air” and said that restricting the Chinese firm only to the peripheries “rests on the assumption that the core cannot be compromised from the edge. Most cyber experts whom I have spoken to know that this is an unsafe assumption, because they know that the whole 5G network can be attacked starting from the compromised edge, given the nature of change to the technological capability of the edge.” “The UK Government have brushed aside the concerns of all our most important allies and the people we generally rely on. There is an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that Huawei is an untrusted vendor, which should not be given any further opportunity of access to our most vital communication networks,” he said. There have also been concerns over reports of slavery in Huawei’s supply chain. Tory MP Bob Seely has asked BT, which owns EE, to investigate whether using Huawei contravenes the telecoms company’s anti-slavery policy, after the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) study — Uyghurs For Sale — alleged that third-party suppliers to Huawei (amongst other firms named in the report) are using the forced labour of China’s Muslim minority. BT is said to be in discussions with Huawei over the report.

"Greece has accused the Turkish government of spreading “fake news” propaganda amid claims as many as five migrants have been shot dead on the border. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed that the Greek police had killed “at least five people” and that the Greek border forces had intentionally tried to pierce rubber dinghies used by migrants in an effort to sink them. “Greece persecutes those people,” Erdogan alleged in the Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah on Friday, saying: “Those [Greek] politicians should know that human life is not cheap.” “Are the borders open or closed? We don’t have time to discuss it anymore. It is done. Refugees are leaving on their own,” he added. President Erdogan also noted that he had refused an invitation from Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov to hold a trilateral summit that would include Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, saying that he rejected it because of the Greek police’s alleged treatment of migrants. “Our borders will not close. Bulgarian prime minister Borissov has asked to meet in Sofia and invite Kyriakos Mitsotakis. On the day he proposed it, there were two deaths at the border. I don’t want to be in the same place and in the same photo as him,” Erdogan claimed.

Others have also claimed that the Turkish government has not only been bussing in migrants to the border area but has been arming them with tear gas and actively helping them get across the border into Greece.

"Dramatic pictures and video are emerging of fires raging along the border between Greece and Turkey, as migrants — aided and even armed by the Turks, according to the Greeks — continue their efforts to force their way in. The European Union, including the United Kingdom, funnelled billions of euros to the Islamist government in Ankara in an effort to persuade it to bring the migrant crisis under a modicum of control after hundreds of thousands of illegal border crossings, often by sea, in 2015-16. That deal unravelled at the end of February 2020, as Turkish president Reep Tayyip Erdogan announced migrants were free to pass through his country and into Europe, seemingly as punishment for the West’s failure to offer sufficient support to his invasion of Syria, which has become fraught with danger as his forces clash with the Russian-backed Syrian government in Idlib province.   Greeks riot police clash with migrants along the Greece-Turkey border in the village of Kastanies on March 6, 2020.

Prime Minister Mitsotakis accused the Turkish government of having “systematically assisted, both at land and at sea, people in their effort to cross into Greece,” but vowed that “Europe is not going to be blackmailed over this problem by Turkey.” A migrant throws tear gas at Greek police on the Turkish-Greek border in Pazarkule, Turkey, on Friday, March 6, 2020.

(Photo by BULENT KILIC/AFP via Getty Images) Social media gives some indication of just how tense the situation on the Greek border has become, with video footage purporting to show Turkish police firing tear gas over the border at Greek police — in response to the Greeks firing tear gas at them, the Turks claim — and heavily armed soldiers from either country staring each down through border fencing as they patrol the frontier, just yards apart. The history of relations between the two countries has been far from easy, with Greeks having inhabited what is now the Turkish heartland for more than a thousand years before the Turks arrived there, and Greeks continuing to comprise a very substantial minority of Turkey’s population right up until the 1920s — when a combination of war, genocide, and population exchange all but eliminated their presence. Turkey continues to menace its much smaller neighbour down to the present day, laying claim to a number of Greek islands and violating Greek airspace and territorial waters hundreds or even thousands of times every year.

"Finland’s millennial feminist-led government faces a vote of no confidence after pledging to send personnel to the Greek border — to help migrants claim asylum. 34-year-old Green League politician Maria Ohisalo, who serves as Minister of the Interior under 34-year-old Social Democratic party leader Sanna Marin in a red-green left-wing coalition government, said Finland was following the common European Union line to “reject Turkey’s attempts to use people as political pawns” — but also said that the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications was “wrong”. The Greeks have been faced with huge pressure at their land border with Turkey, where thousands of migrants have massed, facilitated by transport provided by the Turkish authorities. The migrants have been making violent sallies against Greek border forces for days, often under cover of tear gas fire on the Greek lines by Turkish personnel — although the Turks claim this has only been in response to the Greeks firing tear gas at them. WATCH: Turkey Arms Migrants with Tear Gas, Sends Freed Prisoners to Border, Claims Greek Government https://t.co/Y7F6saZiTA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  But despite going along with the official EU-mandated line of support for the Greek government and committing to “sending a four-guard unit to take part in a rapid border intervention operation” on the Greek border, according to public broadcaster Yle, the Finnish government has also denounced the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications — and suggested any Finnish personnel on the ground will “try to support Greece” by receiving asylum seekers. “The Finnish government’s position here is clear. When we secure our borders, we are abiding by international obligations. International obligations include [observing] the right to apply for asylum. This is one of the areas where we will try to support Greece,” said Maria Ohisalo. Danish personnel operating in Greek waters with Frontex, the European Union Border and Coast Guard Agency, have already boasted of having defied orders from Greek senior officers to turn back illegal migrants arriving in Greek territorial waters by sea, instead bringing them to the Greek island of Kos. Greek Frontex leader ordered Danish Frontex patrol boat to force 33 rescued refugees/migrants back in their dingy and to tow them across the sea border. The Danish patrol boat refused to follow the order from ""Operation Poseidon"" headquarters, https://t.co/0XyNztHWMp — Ole Ryborg (@OleRyborg) March 6, 2020  The Finns Party — formerly the True Finns — is calling for a vote of no confidence in the left-wing government over its contradictory position on the border crisis, which was further complicated by finance minister Katri Kulmuni, 32. Kulumni, filling in for the prime minister — who had jetted off to New York to attend United Nations events marking International Women’s Day — stated: “We support Greece in ensuring its external borders hold. Connected to this is the fact that international law and human rights must be observed.” The Finns Party deemed that this amounted to obfuscating the government’s position, as supporting Greece’s efforts to hold its border while also insisting on its supposed obligations to receive people claiming to be asylum seekers are mutually exclusive positions. For its part, the Finnish government has insisted it will not turn away any migrants who arrive at its own border.

"A total of 76 per cent of the Greek public support the tough border control policy enacted by the conservative Greek government, according to polling. The poll, which was conducted by polling firm Pulse, found that just 18 per cent of the Greek public thought the measures currently being taken by the government to stop large numbers of migrants entering the country was wrong. The results also showed that 84 per cent of Greeks were very concerned about Turkey’s attitude toward the border situation, Greek newspaper Proto Thema reports. Respondents were also asked about their concerns regarding the spread of the coronavirus in Greece, which has around 45 confirmed cases so far. Just under half of those surveyed, 42 per cent, said they were concerned about a major outbreak occurring in Greece. The ruling New Democracy (ND) party also remain the most popular in the country, with 39 per cent of the vote in the poll, ahead of the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) headed by former Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, which scored 25 per cent. WATCH: Turkey Arms Migrants with Tear Gas, Sends Freed Prisoners to Border, Claims Greek Government https://t.co/Y7F6saZiTA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  The polls are likely to be welcome news for the Greek government which has been hit with several accusations by Turkish authorities in recent days, including allegations that border guards had fatally shot a Syrian migrant earlier in the week. Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas slammed the Turkish allegations as “fake news”, saying: “Video showing fatality on Greek-Turkish border is fake news. We call upon everyone to use caution when reporting news that furthers Turkish propaganda.” Since Turkey opened the gates to migrants last week, tensions at the land border between Greece and Turkey have been high. Migrants have attacked Greek border officials while attempting to force their way into the country. On Friday, Mr Petsas presented a video on social media that alleged the Turkish government was arming migrants with tear gas and was releasing prisoners and sending them to the border area as well.

"MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak during his Friday broadcast. Hayes said, “Consider this, how does anyone, you, me, Vice President Pence, know how to handle a situation if we don’t know the full know the scope? We have had three months to prepare for the coronavirus to come to the U.S. and see how outbreaks started. We have completely failed. The federal government have completely failed until now. We are weeks and weeks behind where we should be.” After comparing the coronavirus outbreak to Chernobyl and Hurricane Maria, Hayes played a clip of Trump being asked about a cruise ship docked off the California coast with coronavirus patients. Trump said, “I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather — because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship … I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off.” Hayes said, “He’s saying that his preference, in defiance of the experts, is that the sick Americans stay marooned on the boat because he doesn’t want the numbers going up for him… All he cares about at the numbers, not the actual problem.” He concluded, “You cannot spin a virus. Countries like China learned that early on. Spinning is all our president knows. This is what happens when you elect a BS artist to the most important job in the country.

"President Donald Trump has fortified his White House with a new chief of staff, former House Freedom Caucus chairman and retiring Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC). On Friday night, the president named Meadows his new incoming White House chief of staff, announcing that his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would become the new special envoy to Northern Ireland. I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020  ….I want to thank Acting Chief Mick Mulvaney for having served the Administration so well. He will become the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020  Meadows served as the second chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, taking the reins from the group’s founder and his close ally, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). Together, Meadows and Jordan have been a pair of the president’s fiercest defenders in the House, but even before President Trump’s 2016 election, the soft-spoken firebrand conservative from western North Carolina has helped pave the future path of the Republican Party—pulling the GOP away from swamp deals and failed establishment politics towards populist, grassroots conservative policies that are much more popular with the electorate. Meadows’ success in Congress has won him many friends among top conservatives and even across the aisle, with a huge swath of Trump allies on Friday evening telling Breitbart News that the president could not have made a better choice going into his re-election campaign. “Congressman Meadows has been one of the most effective advocates for the MAGA movement for years now,” Donald Trump, Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, told Breitbart News. “There are some major battles ahead and I can’t think of anyone more equipped to fight alongside the President for the future of our country.” “Meadows is cut from the same cloth as the President; he’s a fighter and will do what it takes to win,” Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House official and outside ally of the president, added. “He’s the perfect choice to lead the White House staff through election season. A brilliant choice by President Trump.” “Mark has great political instincts and, to put it bluntly, is just a total killer,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and also a former White House official, added. “He’s exactly who President Trump needs by his side in an election year.” “Mark being chief of staff is a massive win for the MAGA movement,” Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, told Breitbart News. “Mark Meadows is the right person at the right time to serve as President Trump’s Chief of Staff,” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News as well. “After enduring Establishment operatives undermining his efforts since his inauguration, the President will now have a fearless warrior on the inside to promote and safeguard his agenda.” Meadows was a back-bencher second-term congressman when he filed a “motion to vacate the chair” in the summer of 2015, a bold move that would have forced a vote on whether then-Speaker John Boehner would be allowed to remain in his position. When Meadows did it, most of the Washington establishment wrote him off and considered the effort unserious, but quickly and quietly he—working with his fellow House Freedom Caucus members—amassed the votes necessary by September 2015 to knock out Boehner. When Boehner realized Meadows had succeeded, he resigned before a public spectacle tanked him on the floor of the House in order to avoid embarrassment. While most of the rest of the media ignored him, Breitbart News traveled to his district that August recess to profile him and provide a detailed report on his then-quixotic effort to change Congress for the better by removing someone who, as Speaker, had pushed a variety of deals with now former President Barack Obama that left the country worse off. In the interview he gave during that trip to his district in western North Carolina, Meadows explained how so many people come to Washington, DC, and forget why they were elected in the first place—but how he wanted to be different. “I think everybody starts out doing that, because they’re real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, ‘Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,’” Meadows said when asked if enough members of Congress listen to their constituents. “The longer they’re there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I’ve had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here? There are some of them that have been difficult for me. A prime example is on the Syrian invasion, where really they were bantering back and forth on should we invade Syria or not? I had my own personal view, the fact I believed that ISIS was going to continue to grow and that we had to go in and put an end to it right away, really quickly. I was war weary, but I felt like we needed to do that. My district started calling the office and sending in surveys and other things as well—87 percent of the people that contacted us, or it could have been 82 – 82 or 87 percent of the people said, ‘We don’t want you to do that.’ We’re tired of wars. It shifted where we were to saying, “Just listen, the people back home…” and it wasn’t just Republicans. It was Democrats, independents, everyone. For us, it’s just about trying to have an open ea, then going to Washington, D.C., and voting the way the people here want you to vote. When you do that, it sometimes puts you at odds with what is deemed pragmatic in Washington, D.C., or ‘the practical thing to do,’ but I try to conduct at least a couple days of really listening every time I come back – especially if it’s for a week or longer where I’m just listening to people. Both the good and the bad. We’re going to continue to try to get better,” Meadows said. Listen to his constituents he certainly did. After he toppled Boehner—a remarkable achievement for a then-second-term congressman—Meadows soon after became the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, replacing its first chairman and founder Jim Jordan. Meadows weaponized the Freedom Caucus, leveraging the group’s approximately 40 members in the GOP majority for the last year plus of Obama’s administration and for the first two years of Trump’s first term to steer the party away from now former Speaker Paul Ryan’s failed visions for Republicans and to guide the party toward successes on major issues ranging from taxes to healthcare to immigration. Supporters of Meadows say that they should expect Trump’s new chief of staff to continue to listen to the constituents who put both of them in office—rather than special interests or lobbyists. “Finally, a chief of staff that respects the Trump supporters who put him in the White House,” J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Breitbart News. Many members of Meadows’ Freedom Caucus unit have gone on to much bigger and better things. Of course, Mulvaney is the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, a position he took after previously serving as director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Trump. But he was one of Meadows’s allies and fellow Freedom Caucus fighters back in the early days for both of them. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who’s currently America’s most popular governor, was a Freedom Caucus member when he served in the House. Former Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), now the frontrunner for U.S. Senate in Wyoming, was a Freedom Caucus member too. Another former Freedom Caucus member, former Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), now works at Liberty University leading efforts to expose Chinese communists. He told Breitbart News on Friday night that Meadows is an excellent choice for Trump to lead the White House staff. “I think Meadows loves the American people as President Trump does and that he is highly ethical and he knows who the bad apples are, and he will help to execute President Trump’s agenda and make America great again,” Brat said. When Ryan was pushing President Trump to support an unpopular and unsuccessful healthcare plan at the beginning of his first term—an Obamacare replacement that critics derisively called “RyanCare”—the deal fell apart, a Ryan failure that hurt Trump in his first few months as president. Meadows, working with Republican members like now former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), revived, reformed, strengthened, and secured House passage of the GOP healthcare plan. It was later doomed in the Senate by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who infamously gave it a thumbs-down on the floor of the Senate as he voted against it. But it would have stopped in the House after Ryan’s failure had it not been for Meadows’ work to save the president’s push for a better healthcare vision for the country than Obamacare. Healthcare was not the only major policy fight in which Meadows helped President Trump against leftist Democrats and establishment Republicans. On everything from ending endless wars to fighting against open borders amnesty pushes to battling for the Trump tax cuts and more, Meadows has been one of Trump’s go-to allies in the House since the president took office—and the two speak on the regular. Meadows was also critical in helping Trump fight back one of the most vicious and unhinged conspiracies against a sitting president in history, which ultimately ended in the president’s acquittal by the U.S. Senate after the Democrat-led House impeached him. A member of the president’s team of House members fighting back against the coup attempt by the deep state, Meadows was critical in securing the president’s position and holding back the plotters. The coup attempt started out with various leftist and media attacks claiming Russian “collusion” with Trump’s 2016 campaign that eventually led to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that cleared Trump in the en, which then led to the renewed attacks on the Ukraine front. The Ukiraine accusations led to the House impeachment effort and, finally, the president’s acquittal. Every step of the way, Meadows was at Trump’s side, fighting back against the leftists and fake news attacks that ended up failing to take Trump down. For all of these reasons and more, Meadows has lots of allies in the conservative movemen. FreedomWorks Vice President Noah Wall told Breitbart News that his group could not be happier with the choice Trump made here. “FreedomWorks could not be more proud that the former House Freedom Caucus chair and strong constitutional conservative will help support President Trump through this critical election year,” Wall said. Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, added that “Mick Mulvaney did a great job of leading the White House through impeachment and has proven to be an extraordinary utility man for the President as OMB Director and the head of the CFPB.” “He will be a trusted problem solver who is able to help Northern Ireland transition through the difficulties of Brexit,” Manning said. But Meadows, Manning added, is “a fighter who has the President’s trust.”",‘The Perfect Choice’: Trump Brings Warrior Mark Meadows into White House as Election Year Chief of Staff,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/the-perfect-choice-trump-brings-warrior-mark-meadows-into-white-house-as-election-year-chief-of-staff/,Breitbart

They have seen a 194 percent increase in .223 (AR-15 amm0) sales, 101 percent increase in 9mm ammo sales, and a 95 percent increase in the sale of 12 gauge shells. The sales of other calibers and types of ammunition have increased as well. On February 28, 2020, the Washington Examiner reported that “preppers” were buying up rifles and pistols and seeking safe havens where they could hide out should a pandemic strike. Hyatt Guns’ Justin Anderson spoke to the spike in ammunition and firearm sales, saying, “I’ve seen a notable spike in the purchase of bulk ammo, which is usually a barometer of people’s fear in these types of situations.” He added, “The person with the most ammo wins.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Democrat voters must determine if Joe Biden is “mentally fit” to serve as President of the United States given the former vice president’s frequently slurred speech and regular misstatements, assessed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas. Biden’s Super Tuesday performance — winning 566 delegates relative to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 501 delegates — is not the result of a strengthening campaign but of a division among Democrat primary voter support between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), determined Pollak. Pollak then highlighted questions of Biden’s cognition given the former vice president’s behavior: Biden doesn’t look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign. On the stage last night — I was at his victory party in Los Angeles — he, at one moment, appeared to confuse his wife and his sister. He slurred his speech. He didn’t seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign. “He did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter,” noted Pollak, referring to Biden’s failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America’s founding documents. Pollak continued: I’m being serious, here. I’m not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They’re going to do whatever it takes to be competitive. Pollak added, “Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job. When you put [Trump and Biden] side-by-side on stage, Biden comes out very poorly, and I don’t think there’s very much Democrats can do to change that.” Thomas highlighted Biden’s “cognitive function” and ability “to be sharp and quick on his feet” as noticeably lacking. Thomas asked if Sanders’ supporters would go with a possible Democrat nomination of Biden as the party’s presidential nominee. “Initially my feeling was that [Sanders supporters] would sit it out. They did not like Biden. They really didn’t like Pete Buttigieg. They  don’t like Elizabeth Warren. Early surveys suggested that the Sanders voters were the least likely to stick with the party nominee. “ What we do know is that right now the Bernie Sanders camp feels that they’re the victims of a coup,” Pollak added, noting Marianne Williamson use of the term. “They feel the Democratic establishment has maneuvered once again to try to steal the election from them, and they’re fighting that.” Pollak stated, “It’s very clear — if it wasn’t before — the Democratic establishment is pulling a lot of strings behind the scenes and really, they’re barely even trying to hide it anymore. You’re going to see a lot more shouting before all this is done.” Thomas praised Breitbart News as a “great site.” “I rely on your site regularly,” he said. “I encourage my listeners to bookmark it. You’re a thorn in the side of a left-wing media and it’s a refreshing. It’s always reliable information, much to the chagrin of what leftists say about Breitbart.

"On Friday, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf signed a disaster declaration to provide increased support to state agencies in combating the coronavirus. As the “COVID-19” pandemic — commonly known as coronavirus — continues its international tour, more and more cases are popping up despite a notable lack of widespread testing. Now, with two cases in eastern Pennsylvania’s Wayne and Delaware counties, Gov. Tom Wolf is taking measures to ensure his state is ready for the inevitable. “It is critical to prepare for and respond to suspected or confirmed cases in the commonwealth, and to implement measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Wolf said in a press conference immediately following his signing of an emergency disaster declaration. He continued: The disaster declaration is an additional way we can be prepared, so I authorized the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Director or his designee, to assume command and control of all statewide emergency operations and authorize and direct that all commonwealth departments and agencies use all available resources and personnel as is deemed necessary to cope with this emergency situation. But his reassurance was accompanied by some street-level advice to help combat the spread of the deadly contagion. “First and foremost, we want all Pennsylvanians to be safe and remain healthy and follow the practical advice of the Department of Health on ways to protect yourself from any virus,” Wolf said, “and that’s by washing hands, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough and staying home if you are sick.” Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine added her voice to the press conference as well. “As this situation evolves, we will continually update Pennsylvanians through our website, health.pa.gov, our Facebook page and our Twitter account,” she said, but she reminded citizens that “it’s important to remember that the most accurate and timely information regarding this outbreak is available through the Department of Health.” There are currently over 101,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, though the actual number of those infected may be exponentially higher. It has officially claimed at least 3,460 lives at the time of this writing. In that light, President Donald Trump has signed an emergency $8.3 billion spending bill in the interest of protecting the American people. “It’s an unforeseen problem … came out of nowhere, but we’re taking care of it,” he said.",Pennsylvania Gov.

"After three years of fighting childhood leukemia, Jonathan Whetstone rung the victory bell at Columbia hospital on Thursday. Since he was just two years old, Jonathan Whetstone has been fighting for his survival. When he contracted an ear infection and the flu before his second birthday, doctors said they had nothing to worry about. But as his parents watched their infant son’s energy decline, they pursued further testing. That diligence saved his life. Jonathan had been living with undetected childhood leukemia, which can carry a mortality rate as high as 40 percent. The fight for his life lasted for the next three years and finally ended on Thursday morning. “It’s kind of surreal after three years of going through this it’s finally over,” said Maryann Whetstone, Jonathan’s mother. Mark Whetstone, Jonathan’s father, has been overwhelmed by the widespread show of support. “It’s been prayers across the country,” he says, “Even outside the United States. The support we’ve gotten from our churches, families and volunteer firefighters service has been great.” But the local community has been just as fervent. The Edisto and Bolentown Volunteer Fire Department, where Mark volunteers, lent their support to the Whetstone family — and shared in their celebration. “What a Beautiful Day! Jonathan Whetstone has officially BEAT CANCER and rung the bell,” they posted on Facebook on Thursday morning.  But, as they wrote, “our fight still continues.” To that end, the department has signed up to participate in the “7th Annual Curing Kids Cancer Fire Truck Pull,” an event that raises money to fund research for a cure that would save the lives of other children just like Jonathan. “There are many more kids out there that need your help,” they wrote. “Help us continue celebrating Jonathan by donating to the link below. Even the smallest donation can make a HUGE difference.” At the time of this writing, they have raised $9,215 of their $10,000 goal.",South Carolina 5-Year-Old Rings Cancer-Free Bell After 3-Year Battle,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/south-carolina-5-year-old-rings-cancer-free-bell-after-3-year-battle/,Breitbart
"During a portion of an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria released on Friday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reiterated her claim that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) isn’t the strongest person to take on President Trump and stated that 2020 Democrat former Vice President Joe Biden is building “a broad-based coalition.” Clinton said, “As I’ve said many times, I do not think he’s our strongest nominee against Donald Trump.” Zakaria then asked if this was an endorsement of Biden, and Clinton responded that she isn’t endorsing. Zakaria then countered, “There’s nobody left.” Clinton conceded that there isn’t anyone left, adding, “But I think what Joe’s victories on Super Tuesday showed is that he is building the kind of coalition that I had, basically. It’s a broad-based coalition. I finished most of the work I needed to do for the nomination on Super Tuesday, and then it kind of lingered on.

"MSNBC host Al Sharpton said President Donald Trump was tearing apart the “very fabric of this country” by having Attorney General William Barr acting as his personal Roy Cohn-type lawyer. The panel was discussing a judge requesting a version of the redacted Mueller report. Host Nicolle Wallace said, “The federal judge on that issuing criticism saying that the differences between the Mueller report and the attorney general’s description of it, quote, ’cause the court to seriously question whether Barr made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the Mueller report in favor of President Trump, despite certain findings in the redacted report to the contrary. These circumstances generally and Barr’s lack of candor specifically call into question Barr’s credibility,’ a judge wrote that. One George W. Bush picked. And for that reason, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton is ordering government lawyers to give him the complete report so he can evaluate whether the material was properly blacked out.” Sharpton said, “I think what is very important about this last judge on this Mueller report, and the open rebuke of Barr is that not only is he a respected judge, he’s a Bush-appointed judge. We need to emphasize he is a Republican president’s appointed judge. And to come on as strongly as he did, he didn’t leave any room to misinterpret him. I think it is a significant statement.” He added, “It really speaks to how Barr has, in a way, helped this president reinterpret what the presidency is all about. It is a real threat to our we are going to be in this country even if Donald Trump is no longer president after the November election and trying to realign what government is.” He added, “Because if we start normalizing where the attorney general operates as the private attorney to the president, rather than the head of the Justice Department for the people. And a Roy Cohn type of lawyer at that, then we have the whole nation beginning to unravel and reinterpret what is the constitutional premise of how this government is set up. That’s what’s at stake here. This is bigger than Donald Trump and a distorted Mueller report. We’re talking about speaking to the very fabric of this country.

I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

"An illegal alien has been arrested after being on the run from law enforcement for alleged child abuse and child sex crime charges. Jose Bulmaro Cruz-Guillen, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested evading child abuse and child sex crime charges for incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2019, according to WBRC.com. The illegal alien had been twice arrested last year for crossing illegally through the United States-Mexico border. According to law enforcement officials, Cruz-Guillen was investigated in 2014 for allegedly repeatedly punching his four-year-old stepson in the face and on his body. Then, years later in 2019, Cruz-Guillen was indicted for allegedly sexually abusing his stepdaughter for years. The abuse allegedly involved first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, and sexual abuse of a child less than 12-years-old. Before his trial, Cruz-Guillen fled Etowah County, Alabama, in hopes of evading the charges. Last month, though, the Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force in Augusta, Georgia. arrested Cruz-Guillen and extradited him back to Alabama to face the charges.

Jaime Galvan, a 31-year-old illegal alien with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer, was charged with raping the 14-year-old girl after the two met up and he served her two pre-mixed alcoholic cocktails, the Idaho Press reported. The girl told police that Galvan told her to lay down after she became dizzy from the drinks. That’s when Galvan allegedly started touching the girl and raped her. Galvan was asked to stop by the girl but continued, the girl told police. The girl said the rape occurred for about five minutes. Afterward, the girl said Galvan put her pants back on her and left the room. Galvan is currently being held on a $500,000 bond.

"The number of people who have died from seasonal influenza so far has now reached 20,000, including 136 influenza-associated deaths in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported as of February 29. This is up from 18,000 just a week ago. “This number [of children] is higher for the same time period than in every season since reporting began in 2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic,” the CDC reported. As the world gears up to battle the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,460 worldwide, including 13 deaths in the United States in the state of Washington, the CDC is engaged in its usual battle to inform people about influenza and its dangers: Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications.  There are two main types of influenza (flu) virus: Types A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people (human influenza viruses) are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year. The best way to prevent flu is by getting vaccinated each year. “CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 34 million flu illnesses, 350,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths from flu,” the CDC’s Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report said. “Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to flu vaccine in the control of influenza,” the report said. Almost all (more than 99 percent) of the influenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications recommended for use in the U.S. this season.” The CDC report reveals where influenza cases exist on a state-by-state basis. The CDC said influenza reports from the U.S. Virgin Islands have been sporadic and that Guam did not report.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s (D) sanctuary city policy is responsible for freeing an illegal alien who has been accused of child sex crimes, including rape. Miguel Federico Ajqui-Ajtzalam, a 20-year-old illegal alien from Guatemala, was arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency after the New York Police Department (NYPD) freed him following his arrest for felony second-degree rape and second-degree sexual abuse of a person less than 14-years-old. According to the NYPD, Ajqui-Ajtzalam in 2018 was in a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl and had allegedly raped her five times throughout the year. The illegal alien was 19-years-old at the time. When the girl’s mother reported the man, he was subsequently charged with statutory rape. After his arrest by NYPD, though, Ajqui-Ajtzalam was arraigned and released from police custody. The NYPD ignored ICE’s request that he be turned over to them for arrest and deportation. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez defended his decision to free Ajqui-Ajtzalam: The case was reported by the girl’s mother, alleging that her daughter had a sexual relationship with an older teenager, which constituted statutory rape … Accordingly, we did not request bail for this nonviolent felony that allegedly took place a year-and-a-half ago. [Emphasis added] ICE official Thomas Decker said it is “inconceivable” that New York City officials would release an illegal alien charged with rape and sexual abuse of a child. “It’s frightening that our detainer was ignored and he was released onto New York City streets to possibly re-offend,” Decker said. “The safety of city residents, especially the more vulnerable, continues to be a priority for ICE enforcement.” Ajqui-Ajtzalam, according to ICE, first crossed illegally into the U.S. through the southern border on September 23, 2016. The illegal alien was processed as an Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC) and released into the U.S. after less than two months. He was initially encountered by U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) on Sept. 23, 2016 after illegally entering the U.S. without inspection. Ajqui-Ajtzalam was supposed to show up for his removal proceedings at a later date but never did. Now, Ajqui-Ajtzalam is in ICE custody, where he is awaiting deportation. As Breitbart News reported in January, the sanctuary state of New York released more than 7,500 criminal illegal aliens back into communities last year, including convicted murderers and sexual abusers.

"Fox News’s townhall session with President Donald Trump on March 5 averted any questions about raising wages or curbing the legal inflow of foreign workers. The 46-minute program did not mention wages or salaries, Trump’s “Blue-Collar Boom,” blue-collar H-2B visa workers, or Trump’s unfulfilled, campaign-trail promise to reform the huge white-collar H-1B program. But it did have 4.2 million viewers, making it “the most-watched town hall in cable news history,” according to Fox.  The only immigration question was focused on illegal migration — which brings in far fewer wage-cutting workers than do the various H-2A and H-1B visa worker programs, or the legal immigration of roughly one million people each year: Q Immigration. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q Next question is from Jennifer, and she has a question about this issue. THE PRESIDENT: Hi. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Thank you, Mr. President. This is truly an honor and one of the best days of my life. Just don’t tell my husband. (Laughs.) THE PRESIDENT: Wow. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: And I want to know: How are you going to control the illegal immigration without support from the Democratic Party? THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know it’s been hard, but we’ve done it incredibly. It could have been — we have things called “loopholes,” and the loopholes are terrible, like lottery — where you give lotteries. They pick lotteries and they have people coming into our country …. The soft-ball question allowed Trump to talk about his growing progress in building the border wall: And, most importantly, the wall is way under construction. We’re up to 129 miles already. Where we have a wall, by the way, nobody is coming through — practically nobody. We will have, by early next year, almost 500 miles of wall. And once we have that wall, it’s going to stop drugs, it’s going to stop big percentages of everything coming in. Okay? (Applause.) And we’re really — really doing job. Trump’s tough policies have dramatically reduced blue-collar migration over the Mexican border, amid furious resistance from various pro-migration groups in business, law, and Congress. In February, for example, officials slashed the catch and release of migrants to just 2,000 migrants, greatly easing the task of sending them home once their legal stay is up. In May 20189, 80,000 migrants were released because of the mass migration to the border. Trump’s lower-migration, “Hire American” policies have helped to spike wages for blue-collar Americans. But Trump has zig-zagged while business donors push him to increase the legal inflow of white-collar workers via the H-1B and Optional Practical Training programs.

"Scott Presler told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump’s tweets about the trash-filled and rat-infested streets in Baltimore inspired him to help clean up the city and, since then, many other American cities, including San Francisco, where Presler said he was shocked by the conditions on that city’s streets. ….As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019  Trump’s tweets about Baltimore angered the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who represented the city, but Presler reacted differently. “Everybody was pointing the finger but nobody was doing anything,” said Pressler, who is a loyal Trump supporter. “I said, okay, I’m going to send out a tweet saying I’m going to the city of Baltimore even if it’s me standing on a street corner picking up trash,” Presler said. “From that we had more than 170 volunteers descending on the city of Baltimore and we picked up 12 tons of trash in 12 hours in one day,” Pressler said. Breitbart News spoke with Presler at the recent American Conservative Union’s 2020 CPAC convention in Oxon Hill, Maryland, about why he started a movement that has made fans and volunteers of the almost half a million people who follow him on Twitter. Since his first cleanup in Baltimore in August of 2019, Presler and his volunteers and fellow Trump supporters collected 105 tons of trash in Austin, Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles before the New Year arrived. This year, so far, he has also cleaned up in Portland, Oregon, but it was his trip to San Francisco that put a new spotlight on the blight in one of America’s once shining cities. “You saw some horrible things in San Francisco,” Breitbart News asked Pressler. “Can you share what you saw, because it wasn’t just coke bottles and water bottles.” “I can just tell you I have been to some of America’s most dirtiest and dangerous cities — I’ve been to Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco — San Francisco was the only city where you had to watch your step because of human excrement,” Presler said. “You know you hear things about the ‘poop map,’ and you hear things about the city — it’s hard to believe because so many things are hyperbole,” Pressler said. “I’m here to tell you having walked the streets it’s real, it’s factual.” He witnessed people passed out on sidewalks surrounded by trash and used needle syringes. “It was really sad,” Presler said. Presler plans more cleanups on March 14 in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia on April 4. His crew will visit Detroit on May 2 and he also hopes to host a cleanup during the Democrat nominating conference in July. “Sometimes, before pointing the finger at someone else, you have to point it back at yourself and ask, ‘What are YOU doing to help?’” Pressler told Breitbart News.  “I’m not going to wait for the government to fix the problem,” Presler said. “I’m going to do it myself and vote out those who aren’t helping our cities.” And now, Presler has added another date for cleaning up: This Sunday in Nashville, Tennessee. “As soon as I heard about the tornadoes in Nashville, I felt a responsibility to help,” Presler said. “What do all of these followers, likes, and retweets on Twitter mean if I don’t use my platform for good?” Things are coming together. We’ve identified some neighborhoods to help in Nashville. We’re going to literally go door-to-door, asking people what debris they want removed  & if they need anything else.  I’ll have a list of items that volunteers can donate for the cleanup. — #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) March 5, 2020  Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",Scott Presler’s Trump-Inspired City Cleanup Movement Finds Horror on the Streets of San Francisco,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/scott-preslers-trump-inspired-city-cleanup-movement-finds-horror-on-the-streets-of-san-francisco/,Breitbart
"The FBI missed opportunities to stop homegrown jihadis from killing and injuring Americans between November 2009 and January 2017,under the Obama administration and the leadership of the agency’s former director James Comey, an audit released this week by the inspector general (IG) at the Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed. On Wednesday, Michael Horowitz, the DOJ IG who serves as the department’s internal government watchdog, reported: The FBI has acknowledged that various weaknesses related to its assessment process may have impacted its ability to fully investigate certain counterterrorism assessment subjects who later committed terrorist attacks in the United States. Following these attacks, the FBI made various efforts to evaluate and improve its assessment process. However, it has not ensured that identified areas for improvement were formalized and implemented into enhanced policies and procedures. … During our audit, we found at least six attacks committed in the United States by individuals who the FBI had previously assessed or investigated and who were subsequently categorized as HVEs [homegrown violent extremists]. The FBI reportedly defines “HVEs as global jihad-inspired individuals who are in the United States, have been radicalized primarily in the United States, and are not receiving individualized direction from a foreign terrorist organization (FTO).” Horowitz identified the six attacks by individuals who were under the FBI’s radar as: The cited terrorists killed a total of 70 people and injured scores of others. Horowitz highlighted the “lapses” in how the FBI handled some of the cases, noting: Following the 2009 attack at a military facility in Fort Hood, Texas, the FBI requested an independent review of its actions associated with its assessment of Nidal Hasan, the individual who conducted the attack. This review determined that shortcomings in the FBI’s policies and procedures related to counterterrorism assessments contributed to delays and potential missed opportunities to mitigate Hasan’s actions. … Similar lapses in acting on subsequent threat information regarding a previous FBI subject were also noted … following a terrorist attack in Garland, Texas. … Threat information related to Elton Simpson was conveyed … but not acted upon because field office agents did not interpret the information as portraying a significant threat, which resulted in a missed opportunity to avert the attack. … Although the field office subsequently received additional information regarding Simpson and opened an investigation on him, the field office did not open an assessment on Simpson’s roommate, who also had indications of radical behavior and participated in the Garland terrorist attack. The audit also found shortcomings in how the FBI handled the 2013 Boston Marathon attack. Horowitz reported: In April 2014, a multi-agency Inspector General review of the FBI’s actions in assessing Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the HVEs who carried out the terrorist attack, found that the FBI counterterrorism agent assigned to the [case] … did not take certain available steps to evaluate the subject. Although the DOJ [IG] could not definitively determine if these steps would have revealed any additional information, the DOJ [IG] concluded that certain available investigative steps, including conducting additional database searches, asking questions of Tsarnaev and his parents to elicit information about any plans Tsarnaev may have had to travel to Russia, and interviewing Tsarnaev’s former girlfriend and wife, would have resulted in a more thorough assessment [of the threat]. Horowitz suggested that FBI agents were too quick to close some terrorism cases, which resulted in a failure to assess the potential threat adequately. He wrote: Since September 11, 2001, HVEs have carried out over 20 attacks in the United States, some of which occurred after the FBI closed a counterterrorism investigation or assessment on the individual. Following these attacks, the FBI conducted reviews and determined there were weaknesses in its HVE assessment processes. However, we found that the FBI has not taken sufficient action to address these weaknesses. Additionally, in 2017, the FBI conducted an enterprise-wide review and identified potential terrorist threats that may not have been adequately assessed during calendar years (CY) 2014 through 2016, which amounted to 6 percent of the total assessments reviewed. We found that the FBI did not take adequate action on nearly 40 percent of these assessments for 18 months. After we inquired about the lack of action, the FBI reexamined these assessments and, in some instances, the reexamination resulted in the opening of an investigation. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) acknowledged via Twitter on Thursday that many of the missed opportunities occurred under the leadership of Comey, who served as FBI director between July 2013 and May 2017. When I asked James comey after the Pulse mass shooting if in retrospect the FBI concluded too soon that Mateen was not a threat.

"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday announced its updated debate guidelines, which essentially eliminate the chance of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) participating in the upcoming CNN/Univision debate. In order to participate in the March 15 debate, a candidate must have earned at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates allotted up to that point. That effectively eliminates the chance of Gabbard, who remains in the race, participating, as she currently stands with two delegates. The previous debate requirement allowed a candidate to participate if he or she had a single pledged delegate. If the DNC stuck to the previous rules, Gabbard, who did not qualify for any of the debates ahead of the caucuses in Iowa and Nevada or the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, would have been able to participate. Joe Biden (D), as of Friday, held the lion’s share of delegates — 664. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) easily surpasses the 20 percent threshold as well, with 573 delegates. According to Politico, “Biden had earned 48 percent of delegates awarded thus far, while Sanders had 41 percent. (Some delegates have not yet been awarded from states that held primaries this week on Super Tuesday.) DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa signaled this week that a change in requirements was imminent. “We have two more debates– of course the threshold will go up,” Hinojosa said on Tuesday. “By the time we have the March debate, almost 2,000 delegates will be allocated. The threshold will reflect where we are in the race, as it always has,” she added: We have two more debates– of course the threshold will go up.

On Tuesday, she highlighted a Fox News segement featuring Karl Rove, who suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has since dropped out of the race, was the only woman left in the Democrat primary. “.@DanaPerino I’m not quite sure why you’re telling FOX viewers that Elizabeth Warren is the last female candidate in the Dem primary,” Gabbard said. “Is it because you believe a fake indigenous woman of color is ‘real’ and the real indigenous woman of color in this race is fake?”: .@DanaPerino I'm not quite sure why you're telling FOX viewers that Elizabeth Warren is the last female candidate in the Dem primary.

"Landmark Legal Foundation, the conservative public interest law firm chaired by radio host and author Mark Levin, filed an ethics complaint Friday against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for his recent threatening statement against Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. At a demonstration Wednesday with pro-choice advocates outside the Supreme Court, as it heard a challenge to a Louisiana law requiring doctors performing abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, Schumer had singled out Gorsuch and Kavanaugh specifically, saying: “[Y]ou have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you, if you go forward with these awful decisions.” Schumer’s statement earned a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but he refused to apologize. The Landmark Legal Foundation complaint, filed with the Senate Ethics Committee, states, in part, that Schumer’s statement may “inflame the unhinged and incite violence”; that they “may violate criminal provisions of federal law”; and that the Senate should consider censure as a remedy. It notes that the Senate could also choose to reprimand or even expel Schumer for his comments. Currently, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has introduced a resolution to censure Schumer, though it may not have enough support to pass a filibuster threshold of 60 votes. Joel B.

"Four GOP-held Senate seats are currently being led by Democrats, with at least a four-point margin, according to new polls from Public Policy Polling (PPP). The polling found Sara Gideon with a four-point lead over incumbent Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) at 47-43 in the Maine Senate race and Mark Kelly leading Sen. Martha McSally (R-AR) 47-42 in the Arizona Senate race. In the poll conducted in Maine, Collins’ approval rating sits at 33 percent, with 57 percent of voters expressing disapproval of her job performance. In the Arizona poll, PPP found McSally to have a 37 percent job approval rating while 46 percent stated they disapprove of her performance in office. Kelly, who is running to unseat McSally, received a greater favorability rating of 41 percent, while 29 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. The poll also found a correlation between President Donald Trump’s approval rating in Arizona and Maine with that of McSally and Collins. The poll noted, “In Maine only 42 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing to 56 percent who disapprove, and in Arizona only 45 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing to 51 percent who disapprove.” In addition to the results found in Maine and Arizona, Public Policy Polling also found Cal Cunningham with a lead over incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) at 46-41 in the North Carolina Senate race and John Hickenlooper with a lead over Cory Gardner (R-CO) at 51-38 in the Colorado Senate race. Should the Democrats successfully take these four GOP seats currently held by Collins, McSally, Tillis, and Gardner, and lose in Alabama where Sen. Doug Jones’ (D-AL) seat is at stake—assuming nothing else changes – the Vice President next year would cast the tie-breaking vote to decide the majority.

"Hilary Rosen, the Democrat strategist who once attacked Ann Romney for being a stay-at-home mom, apologized Friday to Nina Turner, spokesperson for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), for a racially-charged shouting match on CNN. But for the Sanders campaign, it was not enough. The two had argued Thursday evening on Chris Cuomo’s Prime Time over the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., after Turner suggested that former Vice President Joe Biden was the “white moderate” that King had warned about in his famous “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” Rosen countered that Turner was not qualified to invoke the civil rights leader against Biden. “You don’t have that standing. I’m sorry, you don’t.” Turner resounded angrily: “Don’t tell me what kind of standing I have as a black woman in America. … How dare you, as a white woman.” As the Daily Caller noted, Rosen apologized — but deleted the tweet because it referred to “angry black women,” which some readers found offensive. Sanders demanded an apology directly from Biden on Friday afternoon: .@JoeBiden must accept responsibility for his surrogate telling our campaign co-chair Senator @NinaTurner that she doesn't have standing to invoke the words of Dr. King. That is unacceptable and Joe must apologize to Nina and all the people of color supporting our campaign. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 6, 2020  In 2012, Rosen apologized to Ann Romney, wife of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, for mocking her by saying she had “never worked a day in her life.” Joel B.

"Police are searching for a group of suspects who allegedly stomped on a teenage girl lying on a sidewalk in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday. Surveillance footage showed the group of suspects surround a 15-year-old girl on Utica Avenue in Crown Heights and repeatedly attack her as she lay on the pavement, according to CBS New York. At the beginning of the video, one suspect ran toward the girl and stomped on her as she curled up in the fetal position and tried to protect herself. Seconds later, several other suspects approached and kicked her repeatedly. As the crowd began to disperse, a man wearing jeans and a green shirt bent down and pulled off her shoes, then walked away from the scene. The suspects also reportedly stole the young woman’s cell phone and debit card. “The victim was taken to the hospital with bruising and swelling to her face,” the report said. Friday morning, the New York Police Department (NYPD) tweeted the video and asked residents for help in identifying the suspects: 🚨WANTED for ROBBERY/GANG ASSAULT: On 3/5, at approx 4:10 PM, in front of 216 Utica Ave in Brooklyn, a 15-year-old female was approached by a group of individuals & was punched & kicked to the ground & had her property removed.

In February, New York City residents told Mayor Bill de Blasio during a town hall event that they are fed up with the growing crime rate and asked him to work with state lawmakers to abolish the new bail reform law, Breitbart News reported. “Many people are being beaten, slashed, and hurt by criminals being released. They said they would only release people that are non-violent but they’re releasing people who are very, very violent,” one resident said. “New York City is becoming a crime city. Could you please get rid of bail reform to make our city safer?” she asked him. Despite their concerns, de Blasio claimed people who believe the crime rate is increasing were “not interested in the facts” and accused them of “whipping up fear.” However, the NYPD said Thursday that the state’s bail reform law was mostly to blame for the recent spike in crime, according to the New York Post.  “Criminal justice reforms serve as a significant reason New York City has seen this uptick in crime,” the department stated.","VIDEO: Suspects Stomp, Kick Teenage Girl on Brooklyn Sidewalk",2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/03/06/video-suspects-stomp-kick-teenage-girl-on-brooklyn-sidewalk/,Breitbart
"The left-wing Hollywood celebrities are stoking public hysteria over the coronavirus, using social media to spread fear as well as disinformation about President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly global outbreak. While some stars are using the coronavirus to re-air their hatred of all things Trump, many other celebrities are fanning the flames by making false claims about President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, accusing the White House of lying to the American public and exacerbating the problem. Comedian Chelsea Handler repeated the false claim that President Trump suggested that people who have “tested positive for coronavirus can still go to work and get better there.” Trump supporters: your president just suggested people who have tested positive for the Coronavirus can still go to work and get better there. Go with god. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 5, 2020  But President Trump never said or suggested what Handler claims he did. The president was speaking during an interview this week on Fox News’ Hannity in which he described some situations in which people who have contracted coronavirus only experience a mild case of the illness and quickly recover. President Trump said that some of these people chose to go to work and eventually got better, but he never recommended that they do so. “So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better,” Trump said. I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC.

But Fauci has denied the claim, saying during a recent White House briefing: “Let me clarify. I have never been muzzled — ever.” He said that the rumor arose out of a misunderstanding. “We were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, ‘Let’s regroup and figure out how we’re going to be communicating.’ So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared.” But Tony Fauci – head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH for 36 yrs now (!) – needs Mike Pence's approval to speak publicly.

"A court in a German city has ruled that the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD) will be allowed to erect a statue of Vladimir Lenin, the mass-murdering founder of the Soviet Union. The administrative court in Gelsenkirchen overruled the city’s decision to halt the construction of a monument to Vladimir Lenin, the architect of the Russian Revolution of 1917 which birthed the Soviet Union — a state responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of innocent people. The city had argued that the statue would detract from the historical value of the adjacent savings bank building, but the court ruled that objections over Lenin’s historical atrocities were irrelevant as the statue is to be constructed more than ten meters away from the bank, Deutsche Welle reports. The Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany hailed the decision by the court, saying: “A few weeks before his 150th birthday, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin has once again won a great victory.” The move by the court was slammed by Marco Buschmann, a Free Democrats (FDP) member of parliament from Gelsenkirchen, who said: “A Lenin statue would be a disgrace for Gelsenkirchen” as “Lenin stands for mass murder and totalitarianism.” “Anyone who wants to erect a Lenin statue should ask themselves whether they are still grounded in liberal democratic principles or not,” he added.

The statue was first installed in the city in the early 1990s after a local man purchased the statue following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Benedict Evans, a local venture capitalist, and over 900 people in a Facebook group named “Seattle, Tear Down This Lenin Statue!” called for the removal of the monument to the communist dictator. “If one wanted to pull down statues of profoundly evil people, responsible for uncountable human suffering, this one might be on the list,” Evans wrote. Lenin’s reign as the head of the Soviet Union was marked by mass starvation, the internment of political enemies in gulags (concentration camps), the mass executions of the Red Terror, and the invasion of neighbouring countries. In his persecution of the kulaks — peasants with over eight acres of land — Lenin ordered his men in one instance to: “1) hang without fail, so that the public sees, at least 100 notorious kulaks, the rich, and the bloodsuckers. 2) Publish their names. 3) Take away all of their grain. 4) Execute the hostages.” “This needs to be accomplished in such a way, that people for hundreds of miles around will see, tremble, know and scream out: let’s choke and strangle those blood-sucking kulaks,” Lenin commanded.

A majority, 53%, said that Sanders was their second choice, followed by 32% who said Biden was their second choice, 5% who chose Gabbard, and 10% who were undecided as to who their second choice candidate will be. Despite Biden’s edge, the greatest proportion of likely Democrat voters, 43 percent, are supportive of Medicare for All — a hallmark of Sanders’ campaign. “When asked which candidate had the best healthcare policy, Sanders lead with 43% and Biden followed at 40%,” Emerson reported.

"Swedish populist leader Jimmie Åkesson has been reported to the police for inciting “hate” after handing out “Sweden is full” flyers in Turkey this week. Swedish attorney Behrang Eslami reported the Sweden Democrat (SD) leader to the police, claiming that Åkesson was engaging in incitement against a group of people by handing out the flyers near Turkey’s border with Greece. “I believe that it is everyone’s right to seek asylum in Europe or in Sweden,” Elsami told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. “To go down and try to persuade people, who are fleeing for their lives and in need, not to go to Europe. It is in principle wrong and it violates human rights,” he claimed. Åkesson responded to the police report, telling broadcaster TV4, in comments reported by Nyheter Idag, that he considered himself a voice for many Swedes, pointing to recent opinion polls that have shown his party as the most popular in the country. Swedish Populist Leader Hands Out ‘Sweden Is Full’ Flyers in Turkey https://t.co/kYSdYhi75L — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2020  “I think it is pretty clear when you look at opinion polls and other things that the Swedish people want a more restrictive immigration policy than the one we have had so far,” he said. Lawyer Anton Strand, who was hired by Åkesson, also dismissed the police complaint, telling Nyheter Idag: “It seems to me that people have sought attention rather than wanted to make a serious complaint.” “Notifying a person without basis can in itself constitute a criminal act and my client is also considering reporting the lawyer to the Law Society,” he added. Åkesson’s handing out of the flyers, which stated, “Sweden is full. Don’t come to us! We can’t give you more money or provide housing. Sorry about this message,” is not the first time a country or politicians have tried to dissuade migrants from coming to Europe. In 2018, Belgium launched a social media campaign directed at migrants, stating that many of the promises made by people-traffickers about Europe were actually myths.

"Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) stumped for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at a rally in Detroit, Michigan, on Friday, encouraging supporters to mobilize their friends and family and declaring that it would “feel good to have a president that you didn’t have to check” all the time. Tlaib stumped for the presidential hopeful on Friday in her home state ahead of its upcoming March 10 primary. “This is a once in a lifetime moment in our country to elect someone who won’t sell us out,” she said to cheers. “It would feel good to have a president that you didn’t have to check him all the time,” she continued, instructing the energized crowd to mobilize their friends and family members: 2020 is about showing up for others folks. It really is, because when you cast that vote, please know that vote isn’t just for you. It’s for the kids— kids caged at the border. It’s for that mother that doesn’t know how she can afford insulin for her daughter, for her children. “It’s for all of the people now living in poverty. It’s for my neighbors right here in Detroit that get their water shut off, their kids taken away the following day. Show up for her,” she continued. Tlaib praised Sanders for taking on the “wealthy” and “powerful” and predicted that he will win Michigan. “He’s winning states all over the country, and he’s about to win Michigan,” she said, promising that “another world is possible.” Sanders, for his part, delivered a typical stump speech, calling President Trump a “pathological liar,” “bully,” and “vindictive person.” He also accused him of running a “corrupt administration”:  Michigan, offering 125 delegates, is one of six states voting Tuesday.",Rashida Tlaib: ‘It Would Feel Good to Have a President that You Didn’t Have to Check’ All the Time,2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/rashida-tlaib-feel-good-have-president-didnt-have-check-all-time/,Breitbart
"MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak during his Friday broadcast. Hayes said, “Consider this: how does anyone–you, me, Vice President Pence–know how to handle a situation if we don’t know the full scope? We have had three months to prepare for the coronavirus to come to the U.S. and see how outbreaks started. We have completely failed. The federal government have completely failed until now. We are weeks and weeks behind where we should be.” After comparing the coronavirus outbreak to Chernobyl and Hurricane Maria, Hayes played a clip of Trump being asked about a cruise ship docked off the California coast with coronavirus patients. Trump said, “I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather — because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship … I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off.” Hayes said, “He’s saying that his preference, in defiance of the experts, is that the sick Americans stay marooned on the boat because he doesn’t want the numbers going up for him… All he cares about at the numbers, not the actual problem.” He concluded, “You cannot spin a virus. Countries like China learned that early on. Spinning is all our president knows. This is what happens when you elect a BS artist to the most important job in the country. He has BSed his way through his entire career. He has BSed his way through a crisis, and he is trying to BS his way through this one so here we are.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",MSNBC’s Hayes: ‘BS Artist’ Trump Coronavirus Response ‘Completely Failed’,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/06/msnbcs-hayes-bs-artist-trump-coronavirus-response-completely-failed/,Breitbart
"Democrat voters must determine if Joe Biden is “mentally fit” to serve as President of the United States given the former vice president’s frequently slurred speech and regular misstatements, assessed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas. Biden’s Super Tuesday performance — winning 566 delegates relative to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 501 delegates — is not the result of a strengthening campaign but of a division among Democrat primary voter support between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), determined Pollak. Pollak then highlighted questions of Biden’s cognition given the former vice president’s behavior: Biden doesn’t look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign. On the stage last night — I was at his victory party in Los Angeles — he, at one moment, appeared to confuse his wife and his sister. He slurred his speech. He didn’t seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign. “He did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter,” noted Pollak, referring to Biden’s failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America’s founding documents. Pollak continued: I’m being serious, here. I’m not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They’re going to do whatever it takes to be competitive. Pollak added, “Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job. When you put [Trump and Biden] side-by-side on stage, Biden comes out very poorly, and I don’t think there’s very much Democrats can do to change that.” Thomas highlighted Biden’s “cognitive function” and ability “to be sharp and quick on his feet” as noticeably lacking. Thomas asked if Sanders’ supporters would go with a possible Democrat nomination of Biden as the party’s presidential nominee. “Initially my feeling was that [Sanders supporters] would sit it out. They did not like Biden. They really didn’t like Pete Buttigieg. They  don’t like Elizabeth Warren. Early surveys suggested that the Sanders voters were the least likely to stick with the party nominee. “ What we do know is that right now the Bernie Sanders camp feels that they’re the victims of a coup,” Pollak added, noting Marianne Williamson use of the term. “They feel the Democratic establishment has maneuvered once again to try to steal the election from them, and they’re fighting that.” Pollak stated, “It’s very clear — if it wasn’t before — the Democratic establishment is pulling a lot of strings behind the scenes and really, they’re barely even trying to hide it anymore. You’re going to see a lot more shouting before all this is done.” Thomas praised Breitbart News as a “great site.” “I rely on your site regularly,” he said. “I encourage my listeners to bookmark it. You’re a thorn in the side of a left-wing media and it’s refreshing. It’s always reliable information, much to the chagrin of what leftists say about Breitbart. It’s very accurate information, and I’m pleased you’re there.” The Brian Thomas Show, which broadcasts live on AM station 55KRC in Cincinnati from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern, is available any time nationwide via iHeartRADIO.

"Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ripped into his former political party, the Democrats, and laid out why he considers himself now a “Trumpocrat” in a broad, nearly 30-minute-long exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Saturday morning. Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Blagojevich—whose sentence President Donald Trump commuted last month, releasing him from federal prison—laid out how his old political party has “abandoned” American workers and black voters. Blagojevich said a number of policies his former party’s leaders, from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to former Vice President Joe Biden to even his home-state Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), have put forward have hurt African Americans and working class Americans economically and socially—and now that he is out of prison, and clear of the Democrat Party machine, he is speaking out against it all. What’s more, Blagojevich says the great irony of American politics is that Trump—a Republican—has done more to rectify these problems that Democrats created for black and working class Americans than any of America’s other recent presidents, in large part because Trump has ditched the “traditional” GOP playbook to pursue a more solutions-oriented agenda. Upon his release from prison, Blagojevich announced he is a “Trumpocrat”–making him the highest profile such Democrat who has left the Democratic Party to join President Trump–and here he explains his views in the most in-depth interview yet since his release. “When I say I’m a Trumpocrat—and hopefully a lot of others are as well, and I believe they are—it’s largely because the Democratic Party has not only left us but it’s abandoned traditional Democratic constituencies like working people, factory workers like my father an immigrant who came to America and spent all of his time here as a working man working in a steel factory,” Blagojevich said. “And also, the Democratic Party has for far too long taken the African American community for granted. They’ve not only abandoned them, they’ve sold them out when they passed the crime bill in 1994 that President Clinton and Vice President Biden, then-Senator Biden backed and voted for. Our senator here, Sen. Durbin, voted for it. It’s a bill that led to the mass incarceration of a whole new generation of African American men for nonviolent first-time drug offenses, over-sentencing them and then putting them in a position where they can have no opportunity whatsoever to begin a new life after correcting the mistakes that they made and paying their debts to society, frankly, for the crimes that they committed. President Trump, interestingly enough, is speaking to those constituencies in ways that traditional Republicans never did.” Blagojevich said that whether it’s through his economic policies or his criminal justice reform policies or other norm-challenging fights, Trump has upended the normal political battle lines in a way that is “revolutionizing American politics” and “re-aligning” what would be considered “traditional” political coalitions by zoning in on and successfully “drawing from” what were considered “Democratic constituency groups.” “And I think he’s not only been successful politically because he’s done it, I think he’s revolutionizing American politics,” Blagojevich said. “He’s re-aligning politics in America by drawing from those traditional Democratic constituency groups, the factory worker that used to work in a factory that’s gone because of the 1994 NAFTA bill that President Clinton signed sending all those jobs away. President Trump is bringing them back in places like western Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin and southern Illinois—the rust belt states. One of the many frustrations I had as governor was when I would leave the Chicagoland area where I’m from—I’m from Chicago—and I’d visit places like the Quad Cities or Marion, Illinois, or Franklin County, Illinois, where they used to have coal mines and people were working and that was the economic anchor of the community or you’d go to a place like Galesburg, Illinois, where the Maytag factory once was but has left because of NAFTA and President Clinton and the policies of the Democratic Party that’s supposed to be the party that protected those people and looked out for their interests. It’s hard to be able to explain to those communities that there was hope, that there was a possibility that we might be able to bring some of those economic engines back to the state. Now, at last, we have a president who not only promised to do it but he’s doing it. I think President Trump is making real strides in succeeding in that but more importantly he’s actually addressing the needs of the American worker. And with the First Step Act, he’s actually done something for a community that overwhelming votes for Democrats like me. We easily get 90 percent or better of the African American vote when we run against Republicans. Yet, the Democratic Party I would say cynically has taken the African American community for granted. It’s almost immoral, their treatment of the African American community by sort of just keeping them dependent and in a certain place where they have to look to government for all the answers when at the same it’s actually government through over-sentencing and targeting African Americans that are causing a lot of the problems and conditions in these very communities.” Blagojevich served almost eight years of a 14-year sentence handed down after multiple trials finally resulted in partial convictions, some of which were later vacated on appeal. The first time they came at Blagojevich, he was convicted on only one of 24 charges—the charge was lying to the FBI, something the agency has similarly used to target Trump allies in the various scandals he’s been entangled in—but then prosecutors retried him on 20 counts and he was convicted on 17 of them, acquitted on one, and on the other two no verdict was rendered. Later, on appeal, five of the counts were vacated and Blagojevich’s lawyers continued fighting for years to try to get the Supreme Court to hear them. But eventually, it was Trump in early 2020 who commuted his sentence—and let him out after eight years behind bars. Blagojevich to this day insists he did nothing wrong, and that what he was put away for was politics as usual. In fact the core allegation that he tried to sell Obama’s U.S. Senate seat when Obama was president-elect and Blagojevich was to appoint Obama’s successor, was one of the conviction charges vacated—or overturned—on appeal. But the broader point Blagojevich tells with this story is that there is a serious problem in America’s criminal justice system, and what happened to him could happen to anyone. “On this subject, sadly and unfortunately it took this long—I had this experience I had to endure and I will tell your listeners they put me in prison for things that are routine politics. I didn’t cross any lines,” Blagojevich said. “We were doing routine political things. The sale of the Senate seat was never a crime. That was reversed by the appellate court. I was there for some fundraising requests and they convicted me by moving the line and telling the jury you can be convicted for seeking a campaign contribution without any evidence of a promise or a threat because there was none. But anyway, having said all of that, this long unhappy experience has given me a unique perspective. I truly believe I am an expert witness on this. I have street cred having done eight years in prison and I spent the first 32 months in prison as probably the only governor in American history to be in a high security prison behind what the inmates call ‘the razor wire,’ where I spent nearly three years with over 900 inmates coming and going where some would leave and new ones would come in. They were largely drug dealers, gang-bangers, cartel members, there were bank robbers here, there men there who had committed murder, only two percent were so-called ‘white collar.’ So, I really got a firsthand lesson on real life and yes of course I met a lot of my fellow inmates—particularly drug dealers—who experienced over sentencing. Here’s a classic example, Jonair Moore, my friend who I just left behind is in his 11th year or actually just starting his 12th year of prison as part of a 26-year sentence as a first-time non-violent drug offender, a young African American man. Consider the fact that the average rapist in America serves no more than four years, and here’s Jonair—he’s not unusual, he’s actually the rule not the exception, sent to prison for a quarter of a century for a one-time mistake when no one was hurt. The system is broken and it disproportionately discriminates against African Americans. It’s what the author Michelle Alexander has called ‘The New Jim Crow in America.’” Trump, Blagojevich said, has done more to reform this broken system than any Democrat has—including the first black president, Obama—and he said it was Democrats who created the problem to begin with when Biden and Clinton and Durbin teamed up to push the 1994 crime bill that Obama did nothing to alleviate. “I’ll say this, this is one of the great ironies in modern history: On this issue, it’s actually Donald Trump who’s trumping the first African American president—Obama—and actually doing something to solve this problem and undo the racist injustice caused by that 1994 crime bill, which has led to the current conditions we’re facing,” Blagojevich said. “This was a bill Joe Biden not only voted for, but Joe Biden was a vocal advocate for and so were most of the leading Democrats including my senator here in Illinois Dick Durbin and of course President Clinton was the who signed it.” Asked if these actions by Trump on this front, and what Trump has done with the economy and school choice among other efforts are winning the president support in the black community, Blagojevich said that “my instincts tell me that it will and it will be a dramatic improvement among President Trump’s performance in the African American community among voters.” Democrats have usually won around 90 percent or more of the black vote in most elections. Trump won about eight percent in 2016, which, while better than failed 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s six percent that year, is still a very small percentage. “I’ve only been home a little over two weeks so I haven’t been as plugged into the community as I was in the good old days, but I have made an appearance on an African American radio station here in Chicago maybe the second or third day I was home and I got the sense there was a growing sense President Trump was someone who was actually addressing the problems in the African American community that they have gotten all too often almost accepting that they’re going to receive from the politicians they elected is just lip service,” Blagojevich said. “I think there’s a real sense among people, and it’s growing as the truth gets out, and I think there’s going to be more and more people in the African American community who see that this president, President Trump, is a very different kind of leader than a traditional politician. This is a guy who solves problems as opposed to making honestly—very too often, politicians make promises they have no intention of following through on to begin with. I think that when it comes to criminal justice reform, this is a case where this is a president who’s actually doing real meaningful things that’s leading to the end of over-sentencing of many African Americans in the system. I saw a few guys go home before I went home because of the First Step Act. In terms of the guys I went to prison with, are they seeing what President Trump is doing? The answer is: yes, they are. And I also think a lot of these guys like the fact that this is a president with a badass style and a guy that actually fights. I think they like that too, and that’s waking up a lot of people. They’re sick and tired of the BS.” Blagojevich, who was the home state governor of Obama’s Illinois in 2008, when the former president was first elected to the White House, and was the first governor in America to endorse him that year, also told Breitbart News he now considers it a mistake to have endorsed Obama. Blagojevich said that Obama promised all sorts of changes and hope for the country—“hope and change” were the now former president’s infamous campaign slogan—but Blagojevich says now upon reflection that Obama failed in every respect to bring either to the country, and that they were empty rhetorical catchphrases with no substance behind them. He said Trump, on the other hand, has actually delivered whereObama failed. “President Obama was elected in 2008. Here’s something I’ll plead guilty to: I was the first governor to endorse him,” Blagojevich said. “That I did, and it was wrong—but at the time I thought it was right. Obama’s election if you really think about it was based very little on detail. It was based on his themes ‘hope and change.’ People were sick and tired of the usual baloney in politics and fake solutions dressed up as solutions but they’re not real. ‘These guys are saying they did something for us somehow, but I’m not feeling it. Things continued to stay the same and the lobbyists and the insiders are all getting rich in Washington or in my case in Illinois in Springfield, but how come my tax bill is going up?’ Obama was elected because the American people felt they wanted change and this was a new candidate who was talking about hope and change. It wasn’t a lot of substance under it, but they were so hungry for change they took a leap of faith on President Obama and did something historic electing our first African American president in the history of our country—which is a very good thing for our country. It turns out however Obama was just that, all rhetoric. It was just a slogan. He didn’t do it. So I think that eight years later, when President Trump came down that escalator—I was watching that in prison on one of those televisions in prison—I felt the same way you did. He started to talk and then he didn’t back down. He was losing big because of some of the tough positions he was taking, but I was convinced at that time he was going to win. Now, you have a guy who’s not just saying he’s going to bring change—he’s bringing real hope that he’s going to stand up for something and take the hit and lose something for what he was going to get. It’s not real change unless you ruffle some feathers and make a few enemies. That I think is what President Trump is doing. I think some of the guys I was in prison with, African American guys who are seeing this new president as a very different kind of leader than Obama and frankly all the other ones that preceded President Trump leading up to his election.” Asked about the unique populist space that Trump has found in American politics, Blagojevich said he believes it is the future—whether it’s on trade deals like the USMCA, which got more than 380 votes in the House and 89 votes in the Senate, or on forthcoming major policy packages like infrastructure. He noted, too, that while he disagrees with the socialist solutions offered by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), he thinks that Sanders is zoning in on some of the core problems facing the country—and the culprits in Washington and on Wall Street behind such problems. “President Trump has filled that vacuum,” Blagojevich said. “That’s absolutely right. That’s what’s going on. You see it, frankly, even with Bernie Sanders and his supporters. He’s taken positions and views and he’s offered solutions to the problems that I think frankly are unworkable. History proves that socialism never works, and actually is counter-productive. But at least Bernie Sanders is actually talking about identifying some of the problems that are facing our country. Now, President Trump on the other hand is not only addressing those issues but he’s now the president and he’s actually achieving things and providing real, meaningful solutions that are leading to an economy that is booming because of the very things he has done whether it’s the tax cuts, reducing the regulations, and these trade deals—all are absolutely long overdue. Here again is an example of a different philosophy that Trump is offering to the American people and I think he’s speaking to a whole bunch of different people who frankly tuned out of the process long ago because they understand how full of baloney the political system has become for a long, long time. They’re now coming back into the political system.” Blagojevich added that Trump’s success is in large part marked by how many “enemies” he’s amassed in Washington trying to take him down and stop his progress. “You got a lot of voters who are not even being called by pollsters because they haven’t voted for several elections, but now because President Trump is actually bringing real change and actually keeping promises that he’s making and solving those problems and among the evidence that he’s doing it is that he’s got so many enemies that want to destroy him,” Blagojevich said. “One of the Roosevelt presidents, I think it was Franklin but it could have been Teddy, he said ‘ah, you have enemies. Good. That means you stand for something.’ The fact that President Trump is getting so much pushback and the opposition is so determined to destroy him—and that raise a whole bunch of other issues, and I’m also an expert witness on this and how when you go down and try to shake things up and change things the political establishment comes after you and destroys you personally, this is a real serious problem for another discussion—but the fact that President Trump is getting that kind of response and that the Democrats decided to abuse the impeachment process and use it as a political weapon frankly is a badge of honor for President Trump. It’s more evidence he’s doing what he said he was going to do and he’s changing things and they know it in that establishment in Washington and they don’t like it. So the more he keeps fighting and achieves things and changes things, like USMCA as you say in spite of all this opposition to be able to do the necessary things to get the bipartisan support to pass those trade deals, because he’s been able to use Twitter and the ability to communicate directly to the people, he’s been able to force those people like the operatives and congressmen in Washington to respond to his leadership and support some of his stuff because even though they don’t want to give him a political win they got to support this stuff to get re-elected. So yeah, I think there’s a tremendous space—a lot of room in that area—of those non-voters who tuned out a long time ago and I think you’re going to see President Trump being very successful in November and I think you’re going to see the number of votes that he gets will far exceed what he got the first time and a lot of those will be voters who haven’t been voting for a long time. A lot of them came out in 2016, but my prediction is a lot more of them will come out in 2020 since President Trump has proven to be different from the usual politicians. This is a guy who actually fights to get things done.” Blagojevich said that the same Democrat machine that targeted him—and Trump—is also trying to take down Sanders. That is because, he said, the Democrat Party is now “the party of Wall Street,” he said. “Absolutely, and it seems so transparent to me. This is the new Democratic Party, the Chuck Schumer-Nancy Pelosi Democratic Party,” Blagojevich said. “It’s the party—ready for this—of Wall Street. They’ve become the party of Wall Street. That’s why they sold out the American worker with NAFTA. They went to Wall Street because it’s loaded with campaign contributions. Now, the Democratic Party today because of the growth of the internet and online communications, now the Democratic Party is also the party of Silicon Valley—again, at the expense of the working person and family and the African American community because of some of the other things that they do. They cynically have abandoned the African American community and made a determination to keep that part of our nation dependent upon government in a way so that they have no other place to go but to vote for Democrats and the simple way for Democrats to keep them voting for them is call anybody who offers some kind of solution like school choice or other reforms like criminal justice reform, to call them racists. It’s a real cynical ugly kind of politics that the modern Democratic Party is engaged in. Of course they’re going to do anything they can to keep Bernie Sanders from winning and they’re going to be successful in doing it with the establishment ganging up on him. Bernie, again, is wrong on the solutions but at least he has the courage to raise the issues. I remember here’s where he was so right and I was so wrong. I remember when I was a brand new congressman back after 9/11, me and everybody else we all voted for the Patriot Act. Then there was Bernie Sanders, that crazy guy from Vermont—Bernie voted against the Patriot Act. I remember thinking how crazy he was. He was right, and we were wrong. That Patriot Act has led to the undermining of civil liberties, giving unchecked power of prosecutors who have weaponized their power and now criminalized routine practices motivated not by the desire to serve the interests of justice but instead to go after political enemies or people they want to bring down who are ruffling the feathers of the establishment. Frankly, what they did at the AAA level to a Democratic governor, to me—a lot of the same people, Comey, Fitzgerald, and Mueller, the same ones have been trying to do it at the major league level to a Republican president in President Trump. We have a lot of challenges ahead of us and the Democratic establishment abandoned these traditional voting groups and Bernie Sanders is going to pay a price because he’s got the chutzpah enough to challenge and raise questions that frankly question the establishment.” For Blagojevich, for now, he is unclear about the future—he says he wants to write a book or two, and find a way to help champion the issues he cares about–especially criminal justice reform. But one thing he is certain of: He is “everlastingly grateful” to Trump for having the “testicular virility” that he says Obama did not ever have to right the wrong he considers was done to him by the criminal justice system. “I’m not sure, it’s all very new, I’ve never come out of prison before so after eight years it’s a new experience,” Blagojevich said. “I hope to write a book or two—I’d like to write a book about my experience and what I’ve learned along the way. I think I can offer a unique perspective. I’d also like to write a book about helping people through their struggles and adversity because I share with them how I found the inspiration and the strength and purpose that worked through the long dark wilderness that I was in. I’d like maybe to be able to do something like that that could be helpful to people. I’d like to fight for criminal justice reform and I do believe I have a lot I can say about that from both sides, as a former governor where we did certain things but could have done so much more but also what I went through and have come out of. Right now, I’m doing this thing called Cameo where you do shout-outs to people and it’s a way to earn a living and it’s actually kind of nice because I’ll get a request from a daughter and she wants to celebrate her mother’s birthday so she’ll ask ‘hey governor can you say to my mother you’re a great mother and thank you for raising us children and loving us as you have?’ So you bring a little smile on the faces of people who make these requests, so that’s been nice. But in terms of what I’m going to do in the way of something lasting, it’s unclear right now. It’s all very new. But let me say this—whatever it is, it’s way better than what it was. There’s nothing like being home and being with your family and I’m blessed to be with my daughters and with my wife Patti who are the purpose and inspiration for me to come out and find a way back home. I’m grateful, everlastingly grateful, to President Trump again for having the testicular virility to trump Obama and do the right thing.” LISTEN TO FORMER ILLINOIS GOV.

"Politico continued the media’s effort to trash President Donald Trump’s response to coronavirus, citing “current and former officials” Saturday who fault the president for what they call “Trump-inspired disorganization.” The sources for Dan Diamond’s article Saturday evening are described as “13 current and former officials, as well as individuals close to the White House” — remarkably similar to the “10 current and former Trump administration officials, as well as two people close to the administration” cited in Diamond’s Feb. 26 article attacking Centers for Disease Control (CDC) director Robert Redfield. The article begins by attacking President Trump for disagreeing with Vice President Mike Pence about whether to evacuate passengers off a cruise chip near California, the Grand Princess, on which coronavirus had broken out. The president, Politico reports, wanted to keep the passengers on the ship, though he ultimately deferred to Pence as leader of the nation’s coronavirus fight. What Diamond does not note is that Politico — among others — devoted extensive coverage to criticisms of the decision to evacuate Americans last month from another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined in Japan. That is the context in which the administration is making similar decisions. The fact that President Donald Trump is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn’t suggests that there is something other than reasonable criticism on offer. Politico faults the Trump administration for “failing to secure enough testing to head off a coronavirus outbreak in the United States,” a claim that — if true — would be laid at the feet of the CDC. But while admitting that, Politico uses “current and former officials” to say that Trump’s “atmosphere” at the White House is really to blame. The “atmosphere,” Politico alleges, is one that discourages officials from giving the president bad news. But that fails to distinguish between how the government functions under Trump from how it functions under anyone else. (There were similar allegations of a bad “atmosphere” during the Obama administration when it came to intelligence reports about the fight against the so-called “Islamic State.” An inspector general’s report later found that there had been no deliberate attempts by the Obama White House to distort the intelligence, but that a perception that the administration did not want to hear “bad news” led intelligence analysts to self-censor in some of their reporting.) Politico also faults Trump for failing to appoint “a sole leader to fight the outbreak, as President Barack Obama did with Ebola in 2014.” The implication is that Obama did a good job with Ebola. But the Obama administration was perceived at the time to have bungled the response, and only belatedly put Ron Klain, a political staffer with no relevant experience, in charge.
Diamond also criticizes Trump for replacing his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, with Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), in the midst of a crisis. While it is not clear that had anything to do with coronavirus, one of the hallmarks of Trump’s administration has been the swift removal of people perceived to be doing less than the best job possible. It may not be how “politicos” think Washington ought to function, but it is how the business world works — and it is part of the reason Americans elected Trump. (Arguably, it has worked, and is working.) Politico‘s latest criticism is indistinguishable from hundreds of others that have appeared in the mainstream media since the president took office, driven by unnamed sources with apparent axes to grind and vague complaints about the president’s management style. In a similar vein, the Washington Post accused the Trump administration Saturday of “squander[ing] time” in the fight against the virus, after even the New England Journal of Medicine said that early travel restrictions “may have helped slow the spread of the virus.” The Post‘s sources: “16 current and former administration officials.”
In an atmosphere where Trump’s critics have a strong incentive to a) inflame the crisis, and b) blame it on him, it is remarkable how little the method of criticism has changed. Joel B.

"During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA) touted the coronavirus aid package and vowed House Democrats “will remain vigilant in our oversight of the administration’s efforts to ensure a thorough response that keeps Americans safe and healthy.” Transcript as Follows:  “Hello, I’m Dr. Raul Ruiz, and I represent California’s 36th Congressional District. I’m also an emergency doctor, public health expert and disaster aid specialist with medical, public health and public policy degrees from Harvard. In 2009, I was working in the emergency department when our nation was combatting the H1N1 pandemic. There, on the frontlines, I saw firsthand how important a coordinated, comprehensive, government-wide response is to addressing public health threats like the one we are currently facing. In situations like this, we must prepare for the worst as we work for the best. That’s why this week, House Democrats took early and decisive action to protect the health of the American people by passing the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act. This aid package allocates $8.3 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak, including: more than $3 billion for research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics; $2.2 billion in public health funding for prevention, preparedness and response efforts; and nearly $1 billion in support of state and local health agencies, who are on the frontlines, working night and day to defend our nation’s health. House Democrats’ aid package provides funds to reimburse state and local governments – like Riverside County in my district – for their expenses incurred while assisting with the federal response. This rapid reimbursement is essential for readiness capacity to prevent future outbreaks and treat this disease. We have passed a comprehensive funding aid package to help our public health infrastructure—but House Democrats’ work doesn’t end there. We will remain vigilant in our oversight of the Administration’s efforts to ensure a thorough response that keeps Americans safe and healthy. While Congress has passed a comprehensive supplemental to address the coronavirus, there are steps you can take personally to help keep you and your family safe and healthy. Knowledge is power. And knowing the facts about transmission and prevention reduces anxiety and empowers you to protect yourself and your community. CDC.gov is the best source of information. There, you’ll find real-time updates on the number of coronavirus cases and critical information from our nation’s leading public health experts on mitigating the spread of the virus. There are also simple things that you can do every day to protect yourself and our most vulnerable populations, like people over 60, people with weakened immune systems and people with underlying conditions like diabetes, heart and lung disease. As a physician, here’s what I’d tell my patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19: wash your hands often with warm water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue you can discard, then immediately wash your hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and, if you feel sick, stay home; and, also, clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. With these basic practices, you can and will make a difference in combatting this disease. America—we can do this. Together, we can defend our nation’s health. And, together, we can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. House Democrats are continuing to work hard For The People every day, to protect you and your family’s health—and make sure communities across our nation have the resources they need to stay safe and healthy. We have your back. Thank you.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",Dem Rep.

"A Georgia Republican lawmaker has introduced a bill that would make child transgender surgeries and drugs illegal. On February 27, Georgia State Rep. Ginny Ehrhart (R) introduced the Vulnerable Child Protection Act (HB 1060) in the Georgia House of Representatives. The legislation would ban health care professionals from performing transgender surgeries on a minor child – such as mastectomy, vaginoplasty, castration, penectomy, etc. – “for the purpose of attempting to affirm the minor’s perception of such minor’s sex, if that perception is inconsistent with such minor’s sex.” In addition, the bill would make illegal the administering of medications, such as puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones, to children for the same purpose.  “This form of child abuse is becoming a serious problem in Georgia and is evolving into a national crisis,” Ehrhart told the local CBS affiliate about her bill in October. She added: We are talking about children who have not reached the legal age of consent yet are being subjected to life-altering, irreversible surgeries and drug treatments that render them sterile and permanently disfigured. The psychological damage this does to innocent children must come to an end. This legislation makes such abusive actions criminal. Vernadette Broyles, president and general counsel of the Child and Parental Rights Campaign (CPRC), told Breitbart News in an interview the bill was partly modeled after one that came close to passing in South Dakota. Broyles’ nonprofit, public interest law firm, one she founded to defend the rights of parents to protect their children from the harms of gender ideology, was involved in the drafting of the bill. “Tremendous amounts of research went into this bill,” she said. “Medical, scientific research, and it was vetted by a variety of doctors and specialists.” Broyles said the legislation would include criminal penalties for medical professionals providing transgender drugs or surgeries to minor children, as well as the possibility of review by professional boards and for civil liability. However, the attorney added CPRC’s concern “is not the speed with which this bill precedes.” “It is more important to lay the important groundwork and to educate both legislators and Georgians about these harmful interventions that have been happening in the dark and about which most Georgians are not aware,” she explained. Broyles said her organization has been responding to what, in some cases, is “the wholesale trampling on parental rights.” As Breitbart News reported in October 2018, Broyles, working with the Georgia Adoption and Family Law Practice, co-filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department, one that focused on the sexual assault of a kindergarten girl in a Decatur school district that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. In that case, which is still working its way through the education department’s Office for Civil Rights, the mother of a five-year-old girl alleged that her daughter was sexually assaulted by a “gender-fluid” boy in the girls’ bathroom in November 2017. Broyles said: So, we began to look more closely into what’s going on in schools, and that it wasn’t just the private facilities use, that it was now in other aspects of the school, where various school systems were allowing [transgender] activists into the school, or they were allowing their teachers or their administrators to be trained by activists, such that they were bringing in either curriculum or just a mindset similar to evangelism. “I use that term very deliberately because this thing has some similar aspects to a religious belief and a cult,” the attorney added. “It’s not grounded in science, it’s grounded in a very subjective, personal metaphysical belief.” Broyles said many parents are now seeing teachers or administrators “proselytizing” this transgender belief system in their children’s schools. She said: It’s coming through a variety of different avenues into the school system, but they’re using it to indoctrinate a whole different world view of the very nature of homo sapiens. That’s one of the reasons why transgender ideology is so harmful, is that it is indoctrinating children in a worldview that says there are no boundaries. Broyles explained that her law firm comes to this issue from both a child development and children’s basic civil rights perspective, rather than a political or faith viewpoint. “Children have a central right, that should be protected, to be taught the truth about science and biology,” she asserted, adding: They have a very basic right to view their body not as their enemy, and their biological sex not as a disease. A child has the right to know that his or her biological sex is not a disease and that puberty is not a disorder. Broyles said the other danger gender ideology has created in many schools is the perspective that parents are an enemy to their children, rather than their primary advocates. She discussed situations in which some school districts are actually instructing teachers not to inform parents of a minor child’s change in “gender identity” at school. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty recently filed a lawsuit, on behalf of a group of parents, against the Madison Metropolitan School District, claiming the district violated parental rights by implementing a policy that allows children to change their gender identity without parental notice or consent. “What we’re encountering is schools having a presumption that not only are parents a potential danger to their children, or parents do not have the children’s best interests at heart, but also that it is the schools that know better,” Broyles said. “That’s putting the keys to the car in the child’s hands,” she said. “And also, automatically, the presumption is that parents are a potential threat and danger to their children.”","Georgia Bill Would Make Child Transgender Surgeries, Drugs Illegal",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/georgia-bill-would-make-child-transgender-surgeries-drugs-illegal/,Breitbart

Sanders described the president, as he has in past stump speeches, as a “pathological liar” and accused him of “moving this country into an autocracy.” While Sanders told supporters that he and his opponent, Joe Biden (D) are “friends,” he said they have different vision and records, citing the former vice president’s past positions on the Iraq War, trade agreements, and Social Security, as well as his support from super PACs and billionaires. Despite that, Sanders said Democrats will get behind the eventual nominee because the differences between those within the party are “far, far less” than the differences with this “dangerous” president. Sanders also touted his ultra-progressive positions, including his “100 percent pro-choice” voting record, promising to never appoint a judge who is not “100 percent pro-Roe v. Wade.” He also promised to “expand” funding for Planned Parenthood. The Vermont senator also harped on climate change — one of the central issues of his campaign. “Instead of spending $1.8 trillion a year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change,” he said, prompting chants of “Bernie.” Sanders added that he is prepared to take on the “whole damn one percent.” Watch the full rally below: ","Bernie Sanders Draws Crowd of 15,000 in Chicago: Trump Is ‘Moving this Country into an Autocracy’",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/bernie-sanders-draws-crowd-of-15000-in-chicago-trump-is-moving-this-country-into-an-autocracy/,Breitbart
"Super Bowl champion, businessman, and Utah Fourth Congressional District Republican candidate Burgess Owens joined Breitbart News Saturday, where he discussed the remaining Democrat presidential candidates and President Donald Trump’s commitment to all Americans. “We have a choice now between a full-fledged communist and a socialist Marxist,” Owens told host Matthew Boyle in regards to Democrat presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “This is the Democratic Party that chose these guys,” Owens continued, adding that neither of them understand “what we the people are going through.” Burgess also offered advice to those Democrats who “still love our country” and suggested that they reassess their decisions and think about whether the Democrat Party is the party they “want to be a part of.”  “I think the best decision we have been given today is Bernie Sanders or Biden against our president,” Burgess said. “They have a stark difference in the vision of our country. One is going toward pro-American, Judeo-Christian values, capitalism, and the other going Marxist, socialist, and anti-God, so it’s a good place to be.” Owens also praised President Trump for his efforts in making the American dream a possibility for all Americans. “Now that we have a president that has shown America within three years how an America-loving president should look like, they don’t know what to do next,” Owens said. “Democrats are like a wounded animal and they’re dangerous. A wounded animal is frantic. It’s crazy; it doesn’t know what to do next and that’s what’s happening to the left. They’re doing stuff that’s crazy now. They’re going further and further to the left thinking that America is going to be with them, and there’s no way it’s going to happen. Just get ready for a great turnout.” Owens also outlined Booker T. Washington’s “playbook” and related his tenants to that of President Trump’s, adding that what Washington worked so hard to attain for America is now “being seen within the Trump administration.” “Think about how angry and mean these people are,” Burgess said, jumping back to the conversation on the remaining Democrats running for president. “They’re not bringing hope.” “Don’t trust those guys,” Burgess said. “What they will do to the rest of our country is what they did to my community. What they’re doing to Chicago, Baltimore, around the world, the misery that comes with Venezuela, you name it.” Burgess also claimed neither Sanders nor Biden “have any common sense or desire to love our nation.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.","Burgess Owens: Sanders, Biden Have No ‘Common Sense or Desire to Love Our Nation’",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/burgess-owens-sanders-biden-have-no-desire-to-love-our-nation/,Breitbart

"Johns Hopkins University experts held a press briefing on Friday on Capitol Hill to discuss efforts to confront coronavirus as it spreads around the globe, including the launch of a website with an interactive dashboard that collects data worldwide about the virus, including data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).   Lauren Gardner, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, led the team that designed the dashboard, which has a wide range of always-updating data, from the number of confirmed cases (105,559), the number of deaths from the virus (3,555), the number of people who have recovered (58,354) and cases by region and country. Gardner said that statistics about users of the dashboard shows that the public is mostly using it “looking for reliable, factual information.” But local, state and federal governments, public health agencies — “and pretty much everything in between” are also using it, Gardner said. Statistics show people in the United States account for the majority of users. Gardner said her team has been taken aback but just how popular the dashboard has become. “It’s been pretty popular for awhile,” Gardner said. “At the moment we’re getting well over a billion requests per day — or interactions with this dashboard on a daily basis.” “It’s gone viral on almost every social media channel that exists,” Gardner said. “So I think that this really speaks to this huge demand for reliable, trustworthy, objective information especially around situations like these,” Gardner said.  Lauren Gardner, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, spoke about a new website the school has launched. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News) Others experts on the panel included Jason Farley, professor in the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing; Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Lisa Maragakis, epidemiologist and senior director of infection prevention for the Johns Hopkins Health System; and Andy Pekosz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Panelists called for public calm and warned about the danger of misinformation that is pumped out daily online, including on social media, where Pekosz said health experts have been engaging in conversations to try to get the facts out. Inglesby said there remains “substantial work” that still needs to be done to make the U.S. health infrastructure capable of handling the virus. And, according to Ingelsby, a vaccine that can be made available widely to the public is still 12 to 18 months out. The panel distributed literature that included tips to stop the spread of the virus, including avoiding contact with people who are sick; coughing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue properly; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; clean and disinfect objects and surfaces; stay home when sick except to seek medical help; and wash your hands with soap frequently for at least 20 seconds.

She was also snubbed by CNN’s town hall series despite the liberal network inviting former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, whose polling was lower than hers,” the article said. Following Gabbard’s request, Twitter users voiced their displeasure with the DNC’s decision to update the debate qualifications. “I don’t particularly like your politics – but I suspect Senile Joe and Comrade Sanders are deathly afraid that you’d be seen as a much more viable candidate than them if you were up there on the stage with them,” one person wrote. “Tulsi, you qualified, you deserve to be on that stage. I hate that the elite of the Democratic Party keeps doing this to you,” another commented.","Tulsi Gabbard Asks Biden, Sanders to Demand DNC Allow Her on Debate Stage",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/07/tulsi-gabbard-asks-biden-sanders-demand-dnc-allow-her-debate-stage/,Breitbart
"The Nissan Motor Company has announced that it will be doubling down on its investments in the United Kingdom, bucking predictions by anti-Brexiteers that the British car industry would crumble after Brexit. As a part of a £1 billion investment scheme at its British factory in Sunderland, Nissan announced that it has already invested £400 million to produce the next generation of its Qashqai compact crossover SUV in post-Brexit Britain. The Japanese auto-giant has installed a gigantic press to stamp out vehicle pannels for the new Qashqai. The press, which was tailor-made to produce the SUV, took 18 months to install and cost an estimated £52 million, according to The Telegraph. The new line of Qashqai SUVs is set to hit the market by 2021 and since a typical run of a model lasts for approximately five years, the 6,000 employees at the Sunderland factory will have relatively good job security until at least 2026. At the unveiling of the new production press, Ashwani Gupta, chief operating officer, said: “Designed, engineered and made in the UK, and more than three million vehicles later, it remains the benchmark, just as our team in the UK continues to set the standard for productivity and quality.” UK Employment Rate Reached Record High as It Leaves the EU https://t.co/BkI8fQPXLC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2020  In February, it was rumoured that Nissan would pull out of Continental Europe to focus on the British market, should Britain and the European Union fail to reach a trade agreement by the end of the year. If the United Kingdom leaves without a trade deal, carmakers such as Volkswagen and Ford would face import tariffs on cars sold in Britain, thereby giving companies with British production facilities, like Nissan, a competitive edge. The plan, according to two insiders at the company, vould enable the company to grow from four per cent of the market share to over twenty. Nissan denied that such a contingency plan exists, however, telling the Financial Times: ”We continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.” The statement by Nissan in February led some to believe that its factory in Sunderland could be in jeopardy in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but with the latest round of investments the company has to date spent over £4 billion at the site, and the factory remains the company’s most efficient outside of Japan.

"New Jersey police arrested 25-year-old Roosevelt Twyne for “illegally” carrying a firearm and possessing so-called “hollow point ammunition.” The Washington Free Beacon spoke to Twyne’s attorney, Evan Nappen, who said Twyne is a security guard with a permit to carry a gun. Nappen said, “He was arrested for the hollow point ammunition. Then they claimed he was transporting his handgun illegally. He had a permit to carry a handgun. The law … makes it clear that it’s illegal to transport unless you are licensed pursuant to chapter 58. And that is precisely what a handgun carry permit is.” He noted that the ammunition in Twyne’s possession, Hornady “Critical Duty” ammunition, was issued by his employer. Moreover, he pointed to the New Jersey State Police website, which shows that such ammo is not considered hollow-point ammunition in the state of New Jersey. The New Jersey State Police website says, “Ammunition lacking a hollow cavity at the tip, such as those with a polymer filling, are not considered to be hollow point ammunition. An example of this can be seen with the Hornady Critical Defense / Critical Duty, Cor-Bon PowRball / Glaser Safety Slug and Nosler Inc. Defense ammunition.” Nappen added, “[The ammo is] lawful. It’s publicly announced as lawful because it is. It’s not hollow. It’s filled.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"AMORIO, Greece (AP) – Over the years, villagers who live near Greece’s border with Turkey got used to seeing small groups of people enter their country illegally. The Greek residents often offered the just-arrived newcomers a bite to eat and directed them to the nearest police or railway station. But the warm welcomes wore off. When Turkey started channelling thousands of people to Greece, insisting that its ancient regional rival and NATO ally receive them as refugees, the Greek government sealed the border and rushed police and military reinforcements to help hold back the flood. Greeks in the border region rallied behind the expanding border force, collecting provisions and offering any possible contribution to what is seen as a national effort to stop a Turkish-spurred incursion. In several cases, authorities asked villagers familiar with the local terrain to help locate migrants who managed to slip through holes cut in a border fence or to cross the River Evros – Meric in Turkish – that demarcates most of the 212-kilometre (132-mile) border. “We were born here, we live here, we work here, we know the crossings better than anyone,” Panayiotis Ageladarakis, a community leader in Amorio, a village that lies some 300 meters (yards) from the river banks. Other villages also responded to the call for volunteer trackers. Small groups of unarmed men monitor known crossing points after dark. Video shows Turkish security forces ordering migrants to cross Greek border at gunpoint, terrifying children https://t.co/ziCZJ4AeGH — Borzou Daragahi 🖊🗒 (@borzou) March 7, 2020  “We sit at the crossings, and they come,” Ageladarakis told The Associated Press as he drove a pickup truck with a fellow Greek border village resident along a rough track at night. “We keep them there most of the time, call police and they come and arrest them. Then, it’s a matter for the police. We aren’t interested in where they take them. We just try to help this effort taking place by the army and the police.” Help for the border units also came from Evros businesses and store owners. Nikos Georgiadis, head of the local restaurant owners’ association, said his colleagues delivered food and water to units stationed at four points on the border. “They also asked us for masks and gloves, and we’ll try to find some,” he said. Ageladarakis said all the migrants he encountered over the past few days were cooperative. “These people are frightened. Nobody has caused any trouble,” he said. But the village community leader said that in his view, the people he encountered did not look like they were fleeing wars in their own countries. “There’s nobody coming from a war,” he said. “None of them are refugees. They’re all illegal migrants and that’s why they’re trying to get into Europe [this way].” Greek authorities said that out of the 252 people arrested for illegal entry over the past week as of Friday, 64 per cent were Afghans, 19 per cent Pakistanis, 5 per cent Turks and 4 per cent Syrians, while the others were from Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Egypt.

"Five teenage boys have been charged in connection with an alleged attack on a teenage girl in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said the five suspects, whose ages range from 14 to 17, turned themselves in to the 77th precinct, according to ABC 7. “All five were charged as minors with robbery and assault. Their fate will be decided in Family Court,” the report stated. Video footage of the incident showed one suspect running toward the 15-year-old girl and kicking her as she lay on the sidewalk. Moments later, several others ran up and also assaulted her. When the group began to disperse, a man reached down and pulled off her tennis shoes, then walked away from the scene holding them as the other suspects followed. Officials said the girl’s cell phone and debit card were also stolen. She was later transported to a hospital with bruising and swelling on her face but is expected to recover. Friday, the NYPD tweeted the video and asked the public for help identifying the suspects: 🚨WANTED for ROBBERY/GANG ASSAULT: On 3/5, at approx 4:10 PM, in front of 216 Utica Ave in Brooklyn, a 15-year-old female was approached by a group of individuals & was punched & kicked to the ground & had her property removed. Any info call or DM @NYPDTips at 800-577-TIPS. pic.twitter.com/JjCCFbnhSJ — NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) March 6, 2020  In a media release Thursday, the department said the recent criminal justice reforms were the “significant reason” New York City has seen a rise in crime this year. The release continued: In the first 58 days of 2020, 482 individuals who had already been arrested for committing a serious (felony) crime such as robbery or burglary were rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Thirty-five percent, or 299, were for arrests in the seven major crime categories – murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto – that is nearly triple the amount of those crimes committed in the same 58 days in 2019. All of [sic] people were arrested for offenses that prior to Jan 1 and bail reform, could have landed them in jail. At a town hall event in February, Mayor Bill de Blasio dismissed Queens residents’ concerns about the growing crime rate and accused them of “whipping up fear.” “There are people and organizations in this city that are trying to tell you New York City is not safe, that are trying to tell you we are declining and we’re going back to the ’70s,” he told them. “Listen, listen if you believe that, God bless you.

"Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) has scheduled a vote for the committee next Wednesday to subpoena former Ukrainian politician Andrii Telizhenko, who may shed insight into Hunter Biden’s potential role in trying to help Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings evade corruption charges. A committee meeting to consider a motion to subpoena Telizhenko is scheduled for March 11 at 2:30 p.m., according to a public posting on the committee’s website. The motion will likely pass, with a majority of Republicans on the committee. Telizhenko was a former Ukrainian diplomat. He worked at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington, DC, between December 2015 and June 2016, as the U.S. presidential campaign was underway, according to the Daily Beast. Telizhenko has claimed that former Ukrainian Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Oksana Shulyar worked with former Democratic National Committee (DNC) consultant Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American, to help the Hillary Clinton campaign investigate then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. He told Politico in a January 2017 article that Shulyar instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort, and Russia. “Oksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,” he said. “They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa.” He added, “Oksana was keeping it all quiet [but] the embassy worked very closely with” Chalupa. Other “sources familiar with the effort” told Politico that Shulyar called Telizhenko into a meeting with Chalupa to provide an update on an American media outlet’s ongoing investigation into Manafort. He said Chalupa told him and Shulyar, “If we can get enough information on Paul [Manafort] or Trump’s involvement with Russia, she can get a hearing in Congress by September [2016].” Chalupa confirmed to Politico that she had discussed the possibility of a congressional investigation with the office of Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, but that it “didn’t go anywhere.” Johnson’s subpoena to Telizhenko, however, is focused on his work as a consultant for Blue Star Strategies, a firm Burisma hired to fight allegations of corruption it was facing. Burisma appointed Hunter Biden to its board in 2014, after his father became the point person in the Obama administration for Ukraine and as the firm’s CEO was facing allegations of corruption and money laundering. Despite having no relevant experience, he was receiving up to $83,000 a month. After Biden’s appointment to the board, Burisma hired Blue Star Strategies to help them fight off the allegations of corruption and to lobby U.S. officials on its behalf. The New York Times reported in May 2019 that Hunter Biden was linked to Burisma’s hiring of Blue Star Strategies. “Among the Americans brought in by Hunter Biden’s American business partners to help fend off the investigations was Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm run by Clinton administration veterans that had done substantial work in Ukraine,” the report said. Biden had links to one of Blue Star Strategies’ co-founders — Sally Painter, a former senior adviser for the Clinton administration. He knew Painter from the Truman National Security Project, an organization for young national security experts on the left. Biden and Painter were both directors of the organization at the same time, according to the Washington Free Beacon. The other co-founder was Karen Tramontano, a former deputy chief of staff to President Clinton. While Painter was working for Burisma, she moderated a panel at a Truman National Security Project event on June 24, 2016. Then-Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken had spoken earlier at that event. Three days later, she contacted Blinken’s then-aide William Russo, to schedule a meeting with Blinken and Tramontano to discuss Ukraine, according to the Daily Caller. Painter wrote to Russo, who currently serves as director of communications for Biden’s presidential campaign, “Per my conversation with Tony at the Truman event, Karen Tramontano and I would like to have a brief coffee with Tony at his earliest convenience regarding some troubling events we are seeing n [sic] Ukraine.” “(He said yes),” she added, referring to Blinken, who currently serves as foreign policy advisor to Biden’s presidential campaign. “We are just back from Kiev.” According to the Times, a team from Blue Star Strategies, including John Buretta, a lawyer who served as a senior official in the Obama Justice Department, had two meetings in Ukraine with its top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, in 2016. Lutsenko replaced Viktor Shokin, whom Joe Biden has stated publicly he pressured Ukraine to fire. Lutsenko had taken a hard line against Burisma, but within 10 months of taking office, Burisma announced he and the Ukrainian courts had “fully closed” all “legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations” against Burisma’s CEO and his companies and that he had been removed by a Ukrainian court from “the wanted list,” according to the Times. Sen. Johnson said in a March 1, 2020, letter to colleagues that he has received U.S. government records indicating that Blue Star Strategies sought to use Hunter Biden’s role as a board member of Burisma to “gain access to, and potentially influence matters at, the State Department.” He said the committee has also requested and received documents from Blue Star Strategies and Telizhenko. However, he said Telizhenko said he cannot turn over all relevant records unless he is compelled by a subpoena, since some of them are subject to a non-disclosure agreement in his employee contract and Blue Star Strategies has been unwilling to turn over the records, according to Johnson’s letter. “Because Mr. Telizhenko’s records and information would be responsive to the Committee’s requests, and Blue Star [Strategies] has refused to produce them, a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko for these records is appropriate at this time,” Johnson wrote. Democrats have blasted the subpoena as an attempt to hurt Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, although Johnson’s efforts were in the works weeks before he announced this week he would seek a subpoena. His committee’s investigation into Burisma has also been going on for nearly a year. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) reportedly was considering voting against the motion, but CNN reported Friday that he would vote to pass the motion — likely ensuring its passage — after receiving assurances from Johnson that the investigation would not become a public spectacle. Johnson also announced this week that he would likely issue an interim report within a month or two focused on what Joe Biden knew about his son Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Senate GOP Investigation into Burisma-Biden Heats Up with Subpoena Planned Next Week,2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/senate-gop-investigation-into-burisma-biden-heats-up-with-subpoena-planned-next-week/,Breitbart
"Left-wing actress Bette Midler took her public disdain for President Donald Trump up a notch on Friday, defending “powerhouse” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) from the president’s critiques, calling him the “most hated, most repulsive human male on the planet today.” “#EllizabethWarren is a powerhouse, but Donald Trump, that stable genius, said she was unlikeable,” the Beaches actress said one day after Warren’s announcement. “Well, Don, in breaking news, she’s 100% more likable than you!

She’s a very mean person, and people don’t like her,” Trump explained. “People don’t want that. They like a person like me that’s not mean.” Despite her defense of Warren, Midler affirmed her support for Mike Bloomberg (D) on Super Tuesday, telling her 1.8 million followers that she was “all in” for the former New York City mayor. “TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, as if you didn’t know. And I am all in for @MikeBloomberg. Rail at me all you want, but I saw New York City go from being down on its knees to standing upright and proud after 9-11,” the Hocus Pocus actress said. “It was a long haul, tough; not without mistakes, but he got it done.” TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, as if you didn't know.

They had men all over the place … [but] this time, they were met by dozens of Texans … who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom. As Santa Anna’s men watched from a distance, those brave Texans raised a flag for all to see. On the banner, they painted a cannon along with four words that echoed through the ages.

"Actress and climate activist Jane Fonda has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, calling him the “climate candidate” prior to leading her latest environmental protest in Southern California. During her demonstration, the actress decried oil and gas companies while blaming “a small bunch of white men getting really rich” for causing pollution and health problems for those who live near drilling sites. Jane Fonda led a demonstration Friday in San Pedro and the suburb of Wilmington to protest the fossil fuel industry, demanding that companies put a stop to new drilling activity. The Hollywood star spoke to USA Today before the rally, saying that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is the only presidential candidate who is running to protect the environment. “We have to get a climate president in office, and there’s only one right now, and that’s Bernie Sanders,” she told the newspaper. “So, I’m indirectly saying I believe you have to support the climate candidate.” Fonda joins a growing list of celebrities backing Sanders’ campaign. The socialist candidate has already garnered support from stars including Cardi B, Lizzo, Susan Sarandon, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. “There’s a small bunch of white men getting really rich while they’re destroying the health of the people like the people you heard from. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. And guess what: it’s happening all across the country and all across the world,” she said. “We have to say no more fossil fuels.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that his campaign had raised $22 million in five days following a win in South Carolina and a surge of Super Tuesday wins. Biden’s victory in ten out of 14 states that voted on Tuesday put new life into a campaign that was left for dead just weeks before when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was in the lead. The Democrat former vice president told his supporters all of this on a call on Friday in a fundraising update, giving them a warning that the “Bernie Brothers” would be conducting an “increasingly negative” campaign. “What we can’t let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath,” Biden said. “I know I’m going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the Bernie Brothers will run.” “We can’t tear this party apart and reelect Trump,” he added. “We have to keep our eyes on the ball, in my view.” “Bernie Bros” has been the term to describe hardline Sanders supporters since his 2016 election campaign. These “Bernie Bros” have received a lot of pushback for their aggressive tactics on social media, especially on Twitter. Biden and Sanders are set to face off in the next set of primaries on Tuesday, with Idaho, Michigan, Washington, Mississippi, Missouri, and North Dakota all set to vote that day. In one poll taken among Missouri voters, Biden holds a slight edge over Sanders, and another poll taken after Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MD) exit from the race showed that Biden had a double-digit lead over Sanders.","Biden Rakes In $22 Million, Warns of Bernie Bros’ ‘Increasingly Negative’ Campaign Tactics",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/07/biden-rakes-in-22-million-warns-of-bernie-bros-increasingly-negative-campaign-tactics/,Breitbart

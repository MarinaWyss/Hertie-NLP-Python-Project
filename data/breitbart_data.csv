"A group of Conservative party grandees will seek to pass legislation to make Huawei involvement in British telecoms networks illegal, over fears the Chinese may use the equipment to spy on the United Kingdom. Former Cabinet ministers including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, and Owen Paterson will submit an amendment to Boris Johnson’s Telecoms Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill on Tuesday. It would seek to ensure that no equipment provided by companies deemed “high-risk vendors” by the National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), are used in Britain’s communication networks from after December 31st, 2022. Currently, BT, O2, EE, Vodafone, and Three are all using Huawei in the United Kingdom. Tory rebels speaking to the Financial Times said that as many as 40 to 60 MPs could back them, which could be enough to defeat the vote on the government’s bill. Another said that, currently, the number is closer to an ineffectual 20. While the rebel leaders represent the right-wing European Research Group (ERG) faction, there is also support from “centrist” SO-CALLED One Nation Tories such as Tom Tugendhat. There is also opposition to Huawei from the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party (SNP). Top Tory: Huawei Deal Worst Govt Decision Since MI6 Hired Soviet Spy https://t.co/a5PdzchRW1 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2020  According to The Guardian, an insider said the move is the first in a “guerilla” campaign to force Downing Street to rethink its decision. In January, Prime Minister Johnson announced that he would be giving the go-ahead to allow the Chinese firm to assist developing the British 5G network, against the security advice of Five Eyes security alliance partners Australia and the United States. Assertions that Huawei would only be working on the “non-core” elements and be limited to 35 per cent of the work has not assuaged the concerns of British politicians and security specialists. Last month, Nigel Farage warned that Huawei involvement could threaten intelligence-sharing with allies, a future trade deal with the U.S., and even pose a risk to NATO. MPs discussed Huawei’s involvement in 5G during a debate in Westminster Hall on Wednesday, with Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, calling the decision to allow “effectively a state-owned corporation in the People’s Republic of China under the Communist Party” access to Britain’s 5G network “ridiculous”, comparing it to coopering with Nazis on British radar development just before the war. He said: “Imagine that in 1939 we had been developing our radar systems and decided to have one of the Nazi companies in Germany directly involved. Oh, but we reduced their involvement to 35 per cent, so they only controlled 35 per cent. I wonder how ridiculous that would have seemed.” Report: Chinese Army Stole Over 13 Million British Citizens’ Personal Data https://t.co/ImQe4loOI8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2020  The Brexiteer Tory also said the figure of 35 per cent had been “plucked from thin air” and said that restricting the Chinese firm only to the peripheries “rests on the assumption that the core cannot be compromised from the edge. Most cyber experts whom I have spoken to know that this is an unsafe assumption, because they know that the whole 5G network can be attacked starting from the compromised edge, given the nature of change to the technological capability of the edge.” “The UK Government have brushed aside the concerns of all our most important allies and the people we generally rely on. There is an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that Huawei is an untrusted vendor, which should not be given any further opportunity of access to our most vital communication networks,” he said. There have also been concerns over reports of slavery in Huawei’s supply chain. Tory MP Bob Seely has asked BT, which owns EE, to investigate whether using Huawei contravenes the telecoms company’s anti-slavery policy, after the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) study — Uyghurs For Sale — alleged that third-party suppliers to Huawei (amongst other firms named in the report) are using the forced labour of China’s Muslim minority. BT is said to be in discussions with Huawei over the report.

"Greece has accused the Turkish government of spreading “fake news” propaganda amid claims as many as five migrants have been shot dead on the border. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed that the Greek police had killed “at least five people” and that the Greek border forces had intentionally tried to pierce rubber dinghies used by migrants in an effort to sink them. “Greece persecutes those people,” Erdogan alleged in the Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah on Friday, saying: “Those [Greek] politicians should know that human life is not cheap.” “Are the borders open or closed? We don’t have time to discuss it anymore. It is done. Refugees are leaving on their own,” he added. President Erdogan also noted that he had refused an invitation from Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov to hold a trilateral summit that would include Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, saying that he rejected it because of the Greek police’s alleged treatment of migrants. “Our borders will not close. Bulgarian prime minister Borissov has asked to meet in Sofia and invite Kyriakos Mitsotakis. On the day he proposed it, there were two deaths at the border. I don’t want to be in the same place and in the same photo as him,” Erdogan claimed.

Others have also claimed that the Turkish government has not only been bussing in migrants to the border area but has been arming them with tear gas and actively helping them get across the border into Greece.

"Dramatic pictures and video are emerging of fires raging along the border between Greece and Turkey, as migrants — aided and even armed by the Turks, according to the Greeks — continue their efforts to force their way in. The European Union, including the United Kingdom, funnelled billions of euros to the Islamist government in Ankara in an effort to persuade it to bring the migrant crisis under a modicum of control after hundreds of thousands of illegal border crossings, often by sea, in 2015-16. That deal unravelled at the end of February 2020, as Turkish president Reep Tayyip Erdogan announced migrants were free to pass through his country and into Europe, seemingly as punishment for the West’s failure to offer sufficient support to his invasion of Syria, which has become fraught with danger as his forces clash with the Russian-backed Syrian government in Idlib province.   Greeks riot police clash with migrants along the Greece-Turkey border in the village of Kastanies on March 6, 2020.

Prime Minister Mitsotakis accused the Turkish government of having “systematically assisted, both at land and at sea, people in their effort to cross into Greece,” but vowed that “Europe is not going to be blackmailed over this problem by Turkey.” A migrant throws tear gas at Greek police on the Turkish-Greek border in Pazarkule, Turkey, on Friday, March 6, 2020.

(Photo by BULENT KILIC/AFP via Getty Images) Social media gives some indication of just how tense the situation on the Greek border has become, with video footage purporting to show Turkish police firing tear gas over the border at Greek police — in response to the Greeks firing tear gas at them, the Turks claim — and heavily armed soldiers from either country staring each down through border fencing as they patrol the frontier, just yards apart. The history of relations between the two countries has been far from easy, with Greeks having inhabited what is now the Turkish heartland for more than a thousand years before the Turks arrived there, and Greeks continuing to comprise a very substantial minority of Turkey’s population right up until the 1920s — when a combination of war, genocide, and population exchange all but eliminated their presence. Turkey continues to menace its much smaller neighbour down to the present day, laying claim to a number of Greek islands and violating Greek airspace and territorial waters hundreds or even thousands of times every year.

"Finland’s millennial feminist-led government faces a vote of no confidence after pledging to send personnel to the Greek border — to help migrants claim asylum. 34-year-old Green League politician Maria Ohisalo, who serves as Minister of the Interior under 34-year-old Social Democratic party leader Sanna Marin in a red-green left-wing coalition government, said Finland was following the common European Union line to “reject Turkey’s attempts to use people as political pawns” — but also said that the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications was “wrong”. The Greeks have been faced with huge pressure at their land border with Turkey, where thousands of migrants have massed, facilitated by transport provided by the Turkish authorities. The migrants have been making violent sallies against Greek border forces for days, often under cover of tear gas fire on the Greek lines by Turkish personnel — although the Turks claim this has only been in response to the Greeks firing tear gas at them. WATCH: Turkey Arms Migrants with Tear Gas, Sends Freed Prisoners to Border, Claims Greek Government https://t.co/Y7F6saZiTA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  But despite going along with the official EU-mandated line of support for the Greek government and committing to “sending a four-guard unit to take part in a rapid border intervention operation” on the Greek border, according to public broadcaster Yle, the Finnish government has also denounced the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications — and suggested any Finnish personnel on the ground will “try to support Greece” by receiving asylum seekers. “The Finnish government’s position here is clear. When we secure our borders, we are abiding by international obligations. International obligations include [observing] the right to apply for asylum. This is one of the areas where we will try to support Greece,” said Maria Ohisalo. Danish personnel operating in Greek waters with Frontex, the European Union Border and Coast Guard Agency, have already boasted of having defied orders from Greek senior officers to turn back illegal migrants arriving in Greek territorial waters by sea, instead bringing them to the Greek island of Kos. Greek Frontex leader ordered Danish Frontex patrol boat to force 33 rescued refugees/migrants back in their dingy and to tow them across the sea border. The Danish patrol boat refused to follow the order from ""Operation Poseidon"" headquarters, https://t.co/0XyNztHWMp — Ole Ryborg (@OleRyborg) March 6, 2020  The Finns Party — formerly the True Finns — is calling for a vote of no confidence in the left-wing government over its contradictory position on the border crisis, which was further complicated by finance minister Katri Kulmuni, 32. Kulumni, filling in for the prime minister — who had jetted off to New York to attend United Nations events marking International Women’s Day — stated: “We support Greece in ensuring its external borders hold. Connected to this is the fact that international law and human rights must be observed.” The Finns Party deemed that this amounted to obfuscating the government’s position, as supporting Greece’s efforts to hold its border while also insisting on its supposed obligations to receive people claiming to be asylum seekers are mutually exclusive positions. For its part, the Finnish government has insisted it will not turn away any migrants who arrive at its own border.

"A total of 76 per cent of the Greek public support the tough border control policy enacted by the conservative Greek government, according to polling. The poll, which was conducted by polling firm Pulse, found that just 18 per cent of the Greek public thought the measures currently being taken by the government to stop large numbers of migrants entering the country was wrong. The results also showed that 84 per cent of Greeks were very concerned about Turkey’s attitude toward the border situation, Greek newspaper Proto Thema reports. Respondents were also asked about their concerns regarding the spread of the coronavirus in Greece, which has around 45 confirmed cases so far. Just under half of those surveyed, 42 per cent, said they were concerned about a major outbreak occurring in Greece. The ruling New Democracy (ND) party also remain the most popular in the country, with 39 per cent of the vote in the poll, ahead of the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) headed by former Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, which scored 25 per cent. WATCH: Turkey Arms Migrants with Tear Gas, Sends Freed Prisoners to Border, Claims Greek Government https://t.co/Y7F6saZiTA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  The polls are likely to be welcome news for the Greek government which has been hit with several accusations by Turkish authorities in recent days, including allegations that border guards had fatally shot a Syrian migrant earlier in the week. Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas slammed the Turkish allegations as “fake news”, saying: “Video showing fatality on Greek-Turkish border is fake news. We call upon everyone to use caution when reporting news that furthers Turkish propaganda.” Since Turkey opened the gates to migrants last week, tensions at the land border between Greece and Turkey have been high. Migrants have attacked Greek border officials while attempting to force their way into the country. On Friday, Mr Petsas presented a video on social media that alleged the Turkish government was arming migrants with tear gas and was releasing prisoners and sending them to the border area as well.

"MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak during his Friday broadcast. Hayes said, “Consider this, how does anyone, you, me, Vice President Pence, know how to handle a situation if we don’t know the full know the scope? We have had three months to prepare for the coronavirus to come to the U.S. and see how outbreaks started. We have completely failed. The federal government have completely failed until now. We are weeks and weeks behind where we should be.” After comparing the coronavirus outbreak to Chernobyl and Hurricane Maria, Hayes played a clip of Trump being asked about a cruise ship docked off the California coast with coronavirus patients. Trump said, “I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather — because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship … I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off.” Hayes said, “He’s saying that his preference, in defiance of the experts, is that the sick Americans stay marooned on the boat because he doesn’t want the numbers going up for him… All he cares about at the numbers, not the actual problem.” He concluded, “You cannot spin a virus. Countries like China learned that early on. Spinning is all our president knows. This is what happens when you elect a BS artist to the most important job in the country.

"President Donald Trump has fortified his White House with a new chief of staff, former House Freedom Caucus chairman and retiring Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC). On Friday night, the president named Meadows his new incoming White House chief of staff, announcing that his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would become the new special envoy to Northern Ireland. I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020  ….I want to thank Acting Chief Mick Mulvaney for having served the Administration so well. He will become the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2020  Meadows served as the second chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, taking the reins from the group’s founder and his close ally, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). Together, Meadows and Jordan have been a pair of the president’s fiercest defenders in the House, but even before President Trump’s 2016 election, the soft-spoken firebrand conservative from western North Carolina has helped pave the future path of the Republican Party—pulling the GOP away from swamp deals and failed establishment politics towards populist, grassroots conservative policies that are much more popular with the electorate. Meadows’ success in Congress has won him many friends among top conservatives and even across the aisle, with a huge swath of Trump allies on Friday evening telling Breitbart News that the president could not have made a better choice going into his re-election campaign. “Congressman Meadows has been one of the most effective advocates for the MAGA movement for years now,” Donald Trump, Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, told Breitbart News. “There are some major battles ahead and I can’t think of anyone more equipped to fight alongside the President for the future of our country.” “Meadows is cut from the same cloth as the President; he’s a fighter and will do what it takes to win,” Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House official and outside ally of the president, added. “He’s the perfect choice to lead the White House staff through election season. A brilliant choice by President Trump.” “Mark has great political instincts and, to put it bluntly, is just a total killer,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and also a former White House official, added. “He’s exactly who President Trump needs by his side in an election year.” “Mark being chief of staff is a massive win for the MAGA movement,” Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, told Breitbart News. “Mark Meadows is the right person at the right time to serve as President Trump’s Chief of Staff,” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News as well. “After enduring Establishment operatives undermining his efforts since his inauguration, the President will now have a fearless warrior on the inside to promote and safeguard his agenda.” Meadows was a back-bencher second-term congressman when he filed a “motion to vacate the chair” in the summer of 2015, a bold move that would have forced a vote on whether then-Speaker John Boehner would be allowed to remain in his position. When Meadows did it, most of the Washington establishment wrote him off and considered the effort unserious, but quickly and quietly he—working with his fellow House Freedom Caucus members—amassed the votes necessary by September 2015 to knock out Boehner. When Boehner realized Meadows had succeeded, he resigned before a public spectacle tanked him on the floor of the House in order to avoid embarrassment. While most of the rest of the media ignored him, Breitbart News traveled to his district that August recess to profile him and provide a detailed report on his then-quixotic effort to change Congress for the better by removing someone who, as Speaker, had pushed a variety of deals with now former President Barack Obama that left the country worse off. In the interview he gave during that trip to his district in western North Carolina, Meadows explained how so many people come to Washington, DC, and forget why they were elected in the first place—but how he wanted to be different. “I think everybody starts out doing that, because they’re real sensitive to the fact that they just got into office and say, ‘Golly, I want to be a voice for the people,’” Meadows said when asked if enough members of Congress listen to their constituents. “The longer they’re there, the less likely you are to listen. For me, I’ve had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in Washington, D.C., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here? There are some of them that have been difficult for me. A prime example is on the Syrian invasion, where really they were bantering back and forth on should we invade Syria or not? I had my own personal view, the fact I believed that ISIS was going to continue to grow and that we had to go in and put an end to it right away, really quickly. I was war weary, but I felt like we needed to do that. My district started calling the office and sending in surveys and other things as well—87 percent of the people that contacted us, or it could have been 82 – 82 or 87 percent of the people said, ‘We don’t want you to do that.’ We’re tired of wars. It shifted where we were to saying, “Just listen, the people back home…” and it wasn’t just Republicans. It was Democrats, independents, everyone. For us, it’s just about trying to have an open ea, then going to Washington, D.C., and voting the way the people here want you to vote. When you do that, it sometimes puts you at odds with what is deemed pragmatic in Washington, D.C., or ‘the practical thing to do,’ but I try to conduct at least a couple days of really listening every time I come back – especially if it’s for a week or longer where I’m just listening to people. Both the good and the bad. We’re going to continue to try to get better,” Meadows said. Listen to his constituents he certainly did. After he toppled Boehner—a remarkable achievement for a then-second-term congressman—Meadows soon after became the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, replacing its first chairman and founder Jim Jordan. Meadows weaponized the Freedom Caucus, leveraging the group’s approximately 40 members in the GOP majority for the last year plus of Obama’s administration and for the first two years of Trump’s first term to steer the party away from now former Speaker Paul Ryan’s failed visions for Republicans and to guide the party toward successes on major issues ranging from taxes to healthcare to immigration. Supporters of Meadows say that they should expect Trump’s new chief of staff to continue to listen to the constituents who put both of them in office—rather than special interests or lobbyists. “Finally, a chief of staff that respects the Trump supporters who put him in the White House,” J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Breitbart News. Many members of Meadows’ Freedom Caucus unit have gone on to much bigger and better things. Of course, Mulvaney is the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, a position he took after previously serving as director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Trump. But he was one of Meadows’s allies and fellow Freedom Caucus fighters back in the early days for both of them. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who’s currently America’s most popular governor, was a Freedom Caucus member when he served in the House. Former Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), now the frontrunner for U.S. Senate in Wyoming, was a Freedom Caucus member too. Another former Freedom Caucus member, former Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), now works at Liberty University leading efforts to expose Chinese communists. He told Breitbart News on Friday night that Meadows is an excellent choice for Trump to lead the White House staff. “I think Meadows loves the American people as President Trump does and that he is highly ethical and he knows who the bad apples are, and he will help to execute President Trump’s agenda and make America great again,” Brat said. When Ryan was pushing President Trump to support an unpopular and unsuccessful healthcare plan at the beginning of his first term—an Obamacare replacement that critics derisively called “RyanCare”—the deal fell apart, a Ryan failure that hurt Trump in his first few months as president. Meadows, working with Republican members like now former Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), revived, reformed, strengthened, and secured House passage of the GOP healthcare plan. It was later doomed in the Senate by the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who infamously gave it a thumbs-down on the floor of the Senate as he voted against it. But it would have stopped in the House after Ryan’s failure had it not been for Meadows’ work to save the president’s push for a better healthcare vision for the country than Obamacare. Healthcare was not the only major policy fight in which Meadows helped President Trump against leftist Democrats and establishment Republicans. On everything from ending endless wars to fighting against open borders amnesty pushes to battling for the Trump tax cuts and more, Meadows has been one of Trump’s go-to allies in the House since the president took office—and the two speak on the regular. Meadows was also critical in helping Trump fight back one of the most vicious and unhinged conspiracies against a sitting president in history, which ultimately ended in the president’s acquittal by the U.S. Senate after the Democrat-led House impeached him. A member of the president’s team of House members fighting back against the coup attempt by the deep state, Meadows was critical in securing the president’s position and holding back the plotters. The coup attempt started out with various leftist and media attacks claiming Russian “collusion” with Trump’s 2016 campaign that eventually led to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that cleared Trump in the en, which then led to the renewed attacks on the Ukraine front. The Ukiraine accusations led to the House impeachment effort and, finally, the president’s acquittal. Every step of the way, Meadows was at Trump’s side, fighting back against the leftists and fake news attacks that ended up failing to take Trump down. For all of these reasons and more, Meadows has lots of allies in the conservative movemen. FreedomWorks Vice President Noah Wall told Breitbart News that his group could not be happier with the choice Trump made here. “FreedomWorks could not be more proud that the former House Freedom Caucus chair and strong constitutional conservative will help support President Trump through this critical election year,” Wall said. Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, added that “Mick Mulvaney did a great job of leading the White House through impeachment and has proven to be an extraordinary utility man for the President as OMB Director and the head of the CFPB.” “He will be a trusted problem solver who is able to help Northern Ireland transition through the difficulties of Brexit,” Manning said. But Meadows, Manning added, is “a fighter who has the President’s trust.”",‘The Perfect Choice’: Trump Brings Warrior Mark Meadows into White House as Election Year Chief of Staff,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/the-perfect-choice-trump-brings-warrior-mark-meadows-into-white-house-as-election-year-chief-of-staff/,Breitbart

They have seen a 194 percent increase in .223 (AR-15 amm0) sales, 101 percent increase in 9mm ammo sales, and a 95 percent increase in the sale of 12 gauge shells. The sales of other calibers and types of ammunition have increased as well. On February 28, 2020, the Washington Examiner reported that “preppers” were buying up rifles and pistols and seeking safe havens where they could hide out should a pandemic strike. Hyatt Guns’ Justin Anderson spoke to the spike in ammunition and firearm sales, saying, “I’ve seen a notable spike in the purchase of bulk ammo, which is usually a barometer of people’s fear in these types of situations.” He added, “The person with the most ammo wins.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Democrat voters must determine if Joe Biden is “mentally fit” to serve as President of the United States given the former vice president’s frequently slurred speech and regular misstatements, assessed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas. Biden’s Super Tuesday performance — winning 566 delegates relative to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 501 delegates — is not the result of a strengthening campaign but of a division among Democrat primary voter support between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), determined Pollak. Pollak then highlighted questions of Biden’s cognition given the former vice president’s behavior: Biden doesn’t look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign. On the stage last night — I was at his victory party in Los Angeles — he, at one moment, appeared to confuse his wife and his sister. He slurred his speech. He didn’t seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign. “He did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter,” noted Pollak, referring to Biden’s failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America’s founding documents. Pollak continued: I’m being serious, here. I’m not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They’re going to do whatever it takes to be competitive. Pollak added, “Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job. When you put [Trump and Biden] side-by-side on stage, Biden comes out very poorly, and I don’t think there’s very much Democrats can do to change that.” Thomas highlighted Biden’s “cognitive function” and ability “to be sharp and quick on his feet” as noticeably lacking. Thomas asked if Sanders’ supporters would go with a possible Democrat nomination of Biden as the party’s presidential nominee. “Initially my feeling was that [Sanders supporters] would sit it out. They did not like Biden. They really didn’t like Pete Buttigieg. They  don’t like Elizabeth Warren. Early surveys suggested that the Sanders voters were the least likely to stick with the party nominee. “ What we do know is that right now the Bernie Sanders camp feels that they’re the victims of a coup,” Pollak added, noting Marianne Williamson use of the term. “They feel the Democratic establishment has maneuvered once again to try to steal the election from them, and they’re fighting that.” Pollak stated, “It’s very clear — if it wasn’t before — the Democratic establishment is pulling a lot of strings behind the scenes and really, they’re barely even trying to hide it anymore. You’re going to see a lot more shouting before all this is done.” Thomas praised Breitbart News as a “great site.” “I rely on your site regularly,” he said. “I encourage my listeners to bookmark it. You’re a thorn in the side of a left-wing media and it’s a refreshing. It’s always reliable information, much to the chagrin of what leftists say about Breitbart.

"On Friday, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf signed a disaster declaration to provide increased support to state agencies in combating the coronavirus. As the “COVID-19” pandemic — commonly known as coronavirus — continues its international tour, more and more cases are popping up despite a notable lack of widespread testing. Now, with two cases in eastern Pennsylvania’s Wayne and Delaware counties, Gov. Tom Wolf is taking measures to ensure his state is ready for the inevitable. “It is critical to prepare for and respond to suspected or confirmed cases in the commonwealth, and to implement measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Wolf said in a press conference immediately following his signing of an emergency disaster declaration. He continued: The disaster declaration is an additional way we can be prepared, so I authorized the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Director or his designee, to assume command and control of all statewide emergency operations and authorize and direct that all commonwealth departments and agencies use all available resources and personnel as is deemed necessary to cope with this emergency situation. But his reassurance was accompanied by some street-level advice to help combat the spread of the deadly contagion. “First and foremost, we want all Pennsylvanians to be safe and remain healthy and follow the practical advice of the Department of Health on ways to protect yourself from any virus,” Wolf said, “and that’s by washing hands, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough and staying home if you are sick.” Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine added her voice to the press conference as well. “As this situation evolves, we will continually update Pennsylvanians through our website, health.pa.gov, our Facebook page and our Twitter account,” she said, but she reminded citizens that “it’s important to remember that the most accurate and timely information regarding this outbreak is available through the Department of Health.” There are currently over 101,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, though the actual number of those infected may be exponentially higher. It has officially claimed at least 3,460 lives at the time of this writing. In that light, President Donald Trump has signed an emergency $8.3 billion spending bill in the interest of protecting the American people. “It’s an unforeseen problem … came out of nowhere, but we’re taking care of it,” he said.",Pennsylvania Gov.

"After three years of fighting childhood leukemia, Jonathan Whetstone rung the victory bell at Columbia hospital on Thursday. Since he was just two years old, Jonathan Whetstone has been fighting for his survival. When he contracted an ear infection and the flu before his second birthday, doctors said they had nothing to worry about. But as his parents watched their infant son’s energy decline, they pursued further testing. That diligence saved his life. Jonathan had been living with undetected childhood leukemia, which can carry a mortality rate as high as 40 percent. The fight for his life lasted for the next three years and finally ended on Thursday morning. “It’s kind of surreal after three years of going through this it’s finally over,” said Maryann Whetstone, Jonathan’s mother. Mark Whetstone, Jonathan’s father, has been overwhelmed by the widespread show of support. “It’s been prayers across the country,” he says, “Even outside the United States. The support we’ve gotten from our churches, families and volunteer firefighters service has been great.” But the local community has been just as fervent. The Edisto and Bolentown Volunteer Fire Department, where Mark volunteers, lent their support to the Whetstone family — and shared in their celebration. “What a Beautiful Day! Jonathan Whetstone has officially BEAT CANCER and rung the bell,” they posted on Facebook on Thursday morning.  But, as they wrote, “our fight still continues.” To that end, the department has signed up to participate in the “7th Annual Curing Kids Cancer Fire Truck Pull,” an event that raises money to fund research for a cure that would save the lives of other children just like Jonathan. “There are many more kids out there that need your help,” they wrote. “Help us continue celebrating Jonathan by donating to the link below. Even the smallest donation can make a HUGE difference.” At the time of this writing, they have raised $9,215 of their $10,000 goal.",South Carolina 5-Year-Old Rings Cancer-Free Bell After 3-Year Battle,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/south-carolina-5-year-old-rings-cancer-free-bell-after-3-year-battle/,Breitbart
"During a portion of an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria released on Friday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reiterated her claim that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) isn’t the strongest person to take on President Trump and stated that 2020 Democrat former Vice President Joe Biden is building “a broad-based coalition.” Clinton said, “As I’ve said many times, I do not think he’s our strongest nominee against Donald Trump.” Zakaria then asked if this was an endorsement of Biden, and Clinton responded that she isn’t endorsing. Zakaria then countered, “There’s nobody left.” Clinton conceded that there isn’t anyone left, adding, “But I think what Joe’s victories on Super Tuesday showed is that he is building the kind of coalition that I had, basically. It’s a broad-based coalition. I finished most of the work I needed to do for the nomination on Super Tuesday, and then it kind of lingered on.

"MSNBC host Al Sharpton said President Donald Trump was tearing apart the “very fabric of this country” by having Attorney General William Barr acting as his personal Roy Cohn-type lawyer. The panel was discussing a judge requesting a version of the redacted Mueller report. Host Nicolle Wallace said, “The federal judge on that issuing criticism saying that the differences between the Mueller report and the attorney general’s description of it, quote, ’cause the court to seriously question whether Barr made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the Mueller report in favor of President Trump, despite certain findings in the redacted report to the contrary. These circumstances generally and Barr’s lack of candor specifically call into question Barr’s credibility,’ a judge wrote that. One George W. Bush picked. And for that reason, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton is ordering government lawyers to give him the complete report so he can evaluate whether the material was properly blacked out.” Sharpton said, “I think what is very important about this last judge on this Mueller report, and the open rebuke of Barr is that not only is he a respected judge, he’s a Bush-appointed judge. We need to emphasize he is a Republican president’s appointed judge. And to come on as strongly as he did, he didn’t leave any room to misinterpret him. I think it is a significant statement.” He added, “It really speaks to how Barr has, in a way, helped this president reinterpret what the presidency is all about. It is a real threat to our we are going to be in this country even if Donald Trump is no longer president after the November election and trying to realign what government is.” He added, “Because if we start normalizing where the attorney general operates as the private attorney to the president, rather than the head of the Justice Department for the people. And a Roy Cohn type of lawyer at that, then we have the whole nation beginning to unravel and reinterpret what is the constitutional premise of how this government is set up. That’s what’s at stake here. This is bigger than Donald Trump and a distorted Mueller report. We’re talking about speaking to the very fabric of this country.

I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

"An illegal alien has been arrested after being on the run from law enforcement for alleged child abuse and child sex crime charges. Jose Bulmaro Cruz-Guillen, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested evading child abuse and child sex crime charges for incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2019, according to WBRC.com. The illegal alien had been twice arrested last year for crossing illegally through the United States-Mexico border. According to law enforcement officials, Cruz-Guillen was investigated in 2014 for allegedly repeatedly punching his four-year-old stepson in the face and on his body. Then, years later in 2019, Cruz-Guillen was indicted for allegedly sexually abusing his stepdaughter for years. The abuse allegedly involved first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, and sexual abuse of a child less than 12-years-old. Before his trial, Cruz-Guillen fled Etowah County, Alabama, in hopes of evading the charges. Last month, though, the Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force in Augusta, Georgia. arrested Cruz-Guillen and extradited him back to Alabama to face the charges.

Jaime Galvan, a 31-year-old illegal alien with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer, was charged with raping the 14-year-old girl after the two met up and he served her two pre-mixed alcoholic cocktails, the Idaho Press reported. The girl told police that Galvan told her to lay down after she became dizzy from the drinks. That’s when Galvan allegedly started touching the girl and raped her. Galvan was asked to stop by the girl but continued, the girl told police. The girl said the rape occurred for about five minutes. Afterward, the girl said Galvan put her pants back on her and left the room. Galvan is currently being held on a $500,000 bond.

"The number of people who have died from seasonal influenza so far has now reached 20,000, including 136 influenza-associated deaths in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported as of February 29. This is up from 18,000 just a week ago. “This number [of children] is higher for the same time period than in every season since reporting began in 2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic,” the CDC reported. As the world gears up to battle the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,460 worldwide, including 13 deaths in the United States in the state of Washington, the CDC is engaged in its usual battle to inform people about influenza and its dangers: Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications.  There are two main types of influenza (flu) virus: Types A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people (human influenza viruses) are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year. The best way to prevent flu is by getting vaccinated each year. “CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 34 million flu illnesses, 350,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths from flu,” the CDC’s Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report said. “Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to flu vaccine in the control of influenza,” the report said. Almost all (more than 99 percent) of the influenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications recommended for use in the U.S. this season.” The CDC report reveals where influenza cases exist on a state-by-state basis. The CDC said influenza reports from the U.S. Virgin Islands have been sporadic and that Guam did not report.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s (D) sanctuary city policy is responsible for freeing an illegal alien who has been accused of child sex crimes, including rape. Miguel Federico Ajqui-Ajtzalam, a 20-year-old illegal alien from Guatemala, was arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency after the New York Police Department (NYPD) freed him following his arrest for felony second-degree rape and second-degree sexual abuse of a person less than 14-years-old. According to the NYPD, Ajqui-Ajtzalam in 2018 was in a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl and had allegedly raped her five times throughout the year. The illegal alien was 19-years-old at the time. When the girl’s mother reported the man, he was subsequently charged with statutory rape. After his arrest by NYPD, though, Ajqui-Ajtzalam was arraigned and released from police custody. The NYPD ignored ICE’s request that he be turned over to them for arrest and deportation. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez defended his decision to free Ajqui-Ajtzalam: The case was reported by the girl’s mother, alleging that her daughter had a sexual relationship with an older teenager, which constituted statutory rape … Accordingly, we did not request bail for this nonviolent felony that allegedly took place a year-and-a-half ago. [Emphasis added] ICE official Thomas Decker said it is “inconceivable” that New York City officials would release an illegal alien charged with rape and sexual abuse of a child. “It’s frightening that our detainer was ignored and he was released onto New York City streets to possibly re-offend,” Decker said. “The safety of city residents, especially the more vulnerable, continues to be a priority for ICE enforcement.” Ajqui-Ajtzalam, according to ICE, first crossed illegally into the U.S. through the southern border on September 23, 2016. The illegal alien was processed as an Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC) and released into the U.S. after less than two months. He was initially encountered by U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) on Sept. 23, 2016 after illegally entering the U.S. without inspection. Ajqui-Ajtzalam was supposed to show up for his removal proceedings at a later date but never did. Now, Ajqui-Ajtzalam is in ICE custody, where he is awaiting deportation. As Breitbart News reported in January, the sanctuary state of New York released more than 7,500 criminal illegal aliens back into communities last year, including convicted murderers and sexual abusers.

"Fox News’s townhall session with President Donald Trump on March 5 averted any questions about raising wages or curbing the legal inflow of foreign workers. The 46-minute program did not mention wages or salaries, Trump’s “Blue-Collar Boom,” blue-collar H-2B visa workers, or Trump’s unfulfilled, campaign-trail promise to reform the huge white-collar H-1B program. But it did have 4.2 million viewers, making it “the most-watched town hall in cable news history,” according to Fox.  The only immigration question was focused on illegal migration — which brings in far fewer wage-cutting workers than do the various H-2A and H-1B visa worker programs, or the legal immigration of roughly one million people each year: Q Immigration. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q Next question is from Jennifer, and she has a question about this issue. THE PRESIDENT: Hi. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Thank you, Mr. President. This is truly an honor and one of the best days of my life. Just don’t tell my husband. (Laughs.) THE PRESIDENT: Wow. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: And I want to know: How are you going to control the illegal immigration without support from the Democratic Party? THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know it’s been hard, but we’ve done it incredibly. It could have been — we have things called “loopholes,” and the loopholes are terrible, like lottery — where you give lotteries. They pick lotteries and they have people coming into our country …. The soft-ball question allowed Trump to talk about his growing progress in building the border wall: And, most importantly, the wall is way under construction. We’re up to 129 miles already. Where we have a wall, by the way, nobody is coming through — practically nobody. We will have, by early next year, almost 500 miles of wall. And once we have that wall, it’s going to stop drugs, it’s going to stop big percentages of everything coming in. Okay? (Applause.) And we’re really — really doing job. Trump’s tough policies have dramatically reduced blue-collar migration over the Mexican border, amid furious resistance from various pro-migration groups in business, law, and Congress. In February, for example, officials slashed the catch and release of migrants to just 2,000 migrants, greatly easing the task of sending them home once their legal stay is up. In May 20189, 80,000 migrants were released because of the mass migration to the border. Trump’s lower-migration, “Hire American” policies have helped to spike wages for blue-collar Americans. But Trump has zig-zagged while business donors push him to increase the legal inflow of white-collar workers via the H-1B and Optional Practical Training programs.

"Scott Presler told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump’s tweets about the trash-filled and rat-infested streets in Baltimore inspired him to help clean up the city and, since then, many other American cities, including San Francisco, where Presler said he was shocked by the conditions on that city’s streets. ….As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019  Trump’s tweets about Baltimore angered the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who represented the city, but Presler reacted differently. “Everybody was pointing the finger but nobody was doing anything,” said Pressler, who is a loyal Trump supporter. “I said, okay, I’m going to send out a tweet saying I’m going to the city of Baltimore even if it’s me standing on a street corner picking up trash,” Presler said. “From that we had more than 170 volunteers descending on the city of Baltimore and we picked up 12 tons of trash in 12 hours in one day,” Pressler said. Breitbart News spoke with Presler at the recent American Conservative Union’s 2020 CPAC convention in Oxon Hill, Maryland, about why he started a movement that has made fans and volunteers of the almost half a million people who follow him on Twitter. Since his first cleanup in Baltimore in August of 2019, Presler and his volunteers and fellow Trump supporters collected 105 tons of trash in Austin, Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles before the New Year arrived. This year, so far, he has also cleaned up in Portland, Oregon, but it was his trip to San Francisco that put a new spotlight on the blight in one of America’s once shining cities. “You saw some horrible things in San Francisco,” Breitbart News asked Pressler. “Can you share what you saw, because it wasn’t just coke bottles and water bottles.” “I can just tell you I have been to some of America’s most dirtiest and dangerous cities — I’ve been to Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco — San Francisco was the only city where you had to watch your step because of human excrement,” Presler said. “You know you hear things about the ‘poop map,’ and you hear things about the city — it’s hard to believe because so many things are hyperbole,” Pressler said. “I’m here to tell you having walked the streets it’s real, it’s factual.” He witnessed people passed out on sidewalks surrounded by trash and used needle syringes. “It was really sad,” Presler said. Presler plans more cleanups on March 14 in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia on April 4. His crew will visit Detroit on May 2 and he also hopes to host a cleanup during the Democrat nominating conference in July. “Sometimes, before pointing the finger at someone else, you have to point it back at yourself and ask, ‘What are YOU doing to help?’” Pressler told Breitbart News.  “I’m not going to wait for the government to fix the problem,” Presler said. “I’m going to do it myself and vote out those who aren’t helping our cities.” And now, Presler has added another date for cleaning up: This Sunday in Nashville, Tennessee. “As soon as I heard about the tornadoes in Nashville, I felt a responsibility to help,” Presler said. “What do all of these followers, likes, and retweets on Twitter mean if I don’t use my platform for good?” Things are coming together. We’ve identified some neighborhoods to help in Nashville. We’re going to literally go door-to-door, asking people what debris they want removed  & if they need anything else.  I’ll have a list of items that volunteers can donate for the cleanup. — #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) March 5, 2020  Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",Scott Presler’s Trump-Inspired City Cleanup Movement Finds Horror on the Streets of San Francisco,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/06/scott-preslers-trump-inspired-city-cleanup-movement-finds-horror-on-the-streets-of-san-francisco/,Breitbart
"The FBI missed opportunities to stop homegrown jihadis from killing and injuring Americans between November 2009 and January 2017,under the Obama administration and the leadership of the agency’s former director James Comey, an audit released this week by the inspector general (IG) at the Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed. On Wednesday, Michael Horowitz, the DOJ IG who serves as the department’s internal government watchdog, reported: The FBI has acknowledged that various weaknesses related to its assessment process may have impacted its ability to fully investigate certain counterterrorism assessment subjects who later committed terrorist attacks in the United States. Following these attacks, the FBI made various efforts to evaluate and improve its assessment process. However, it has not ensured that identified areas for improvement were formalized and implemented into enhanced policies and procedures. … During our audit, we found at least six attacks committed in the United States by individuals who the FBI had previously assessed or investigated and who were subsequently categorized as HVEs [homegrown violent extremists]. The FBI reportedly defines “HVEs as global jihad-inspired individuals who are in the United States, have been radicalized primarily in the United States, and are not receiving individualized direction from a foreign terrorist organization (FTO).” Horowitz identified the six attacks by individuals who were under the FBI’s radar as: The cited terrorists killed a total of 70 people and injured scores of others. Horowitz highlighted the “lapses” in how the FBI handled some of the cases, noting: Following the 2009 attack at a military facility in Fort Hood, Texas, the FBI requested an independent review of its actions associated with its assessment of Nidal Hasan, the individual who conducted the attack. This review determined that shortcomings in the FBI’s policies and procedures related to counterterrorism assessments contributed to delays and potential missed opportunities to mitigate Hasan’s actions. … Similar lapses in acting on subsequent threat information regarding a previous FBI subject were also noted … following a terrorist attack in Garland, Texas. … Threat information related to Elton Simpson was conveyed … but not acted upon because field office agents did not interpret the information as portraying a significant threat, which resulted in a missed opportunity to avert the attack. … Although the field office subsequently received additional information regarding Simpson and opened an investigation on him, the field office did not open an assessment on Simpson’s roommate, who also had indications of radical behavior and participated in the Garland terrorist attack. The audit also found shortcomings in how the FBI handled the 2013 Boston Marathon attack. Horowitz reported: In April 2014, a multi-agency Inspector General review of the FBI’s actions in assessing Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the HVEs who carried out the terrorist attack, found that the FBI counterterrorism agent assigned to the [case] … did not take certain available steps to evaluate the subject. Although the DOJ [IG] could not definitively determine if these steps would have revealed any additional information, the DOJ [IG] concluded that certain available investigative steps, including conducting additional database searches, asking questions of Tsarnaev and his parents to elicit information about any plans Tsarnaev may have had to travel to Russia, and interviewing Tsarnaev’s former girlfriend and wife, would have resulted in a more thorough assessment [of the threat]. Horowitz suggested that FBI agents were too quick to close some terrorism cases, which resulted in a failure to assess the potential threat adequately. He wrote: Since September 11, 2001, HVEs have carried out over 20 attacks in the United States, some of which occurred after the FBI closed a counterterrorism investigation or assessment on the individual. Following these attacks, the FBI conducted reviews and determined there were weaknesses in its HVE assessment processes. However, we found that the FBI has not taken sufficient action to address these weaknesses. Additionally, in 2017, the FBI conducted an enterprise-wide review and identified potential terrorist threats that may not have been adequately assessed during calendar years (CY) 2014 through 2016, which amounted to 6 percent of the total assessments reviewed. We found that the FBI did not take adequate action on nearly 40 percent of these assessments for 18 months. After we inquired about the lack of action, the FBI reexamined these assessments and, in some instances, the reexamination resulted in the opening of an investigation. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) acknowledged via Twitter on Thursday that many of the missed opportunities occurred under the leadership of Comey, who served as FBI director between July 2013 and May 2017. When I asked James comey after the Pulse mass shooting if in retrospect the FBI concluded too soon that Mateen was not a threat.

"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday announced its updated debate guidelines, which essentially eliminate the chance of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) participating in the upcoming CNN/Univision debate. In order to participate in the March 15 debate, a candidate must have earned at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates allotted up to that point. That effectively eliminates the chance of Gabbard, who remains in the race, participating, as she currently stands with two delegates. The previous debate requirement allowed a candidate to participate if he or she had a single pledged delegate. If the DNC stuck to the previous rules, Gabbard, who did not qualify for any of the debates ahead of the caucuses in Iowa and Nevada or the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, would have been able to participate. Joe Biden (D), as of Friday, held the lion’s share of delegates — 664. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) easily surpasses the 20 percent threshold as well, with 573 delegates. According to Politico, “Biden had earned 48 percent of delegates awarded thus far, while Sanders had 41 percent. (Some delegates have not yet been awarded from states that held primaries this week on Super Tuesday.) DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa signaled this week that a change in requirements was imminent. “We have two more debates– of course the threshold will go up,” Hinojosa said on Tuesday. “By the time we have the March debate, almost 2,000 delegates will be allocated. The threshold will reflect where we are in the race, as it always has,” she added: We have two more debates– of course the threshold will go up.

On Tuesday, she highlighted a Fox News segement featuring Karl Rove, who suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has since dropped out of the race, was the only woman left in the Democrat primary. “.@DanaPerino I’m not quite sure why you’re telling FOX viewers that Elizabeth Warren is the last female candidate in the Dem primary,” Gabbard said. “Is it because you believe a fake indigenous woman of color is ‘real’ and the real indigenous woman of color in this race is fake?”: .@DanaPerino I'm not quite sure why you're telling FOX viewers that Elizabeth Warren is the last female candidate in the Dem primary.

"Landmark Legal Foundation, the conservative public interest law firm chaired by radio host and author Mark Levin, filed an ethics complaint Friday against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for his recent threatening statement against Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. At a demonstration Wednesday with pro-choice advocates outside the Supreme Court, as it heard a challenge to a Louisiana law requiring doctors performing abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, Schumer had singled out Gorsuch and Kavanaugh specifically, saying: “[Y]ou have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you, if you go forward with these awful decisions.” Schumer’s statement earned a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but he refused to apologize. The Landmark Legal Foundation complaint, filed with the Senate Ethics Committee, states, in part, that Schumer’s statement may “inflame the unhinged and incite violence”; that they “may violate criminal provisions of federal law”; and that the Senate should consider censure as a remedy. It notes that the Senate could also choose to reprimand or even expel Schumer for his comments. Currently, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has introduced a resolution to censure Schumer, though it may not have enough support to pass a filibuster threshold of 60 votes. Joel B.

"Four GOP-held Senate seats are currently being led by Democrats, with at least a four-point margin, according to new polls from Public Policy Polling (PPP). The polling found Sara Gideon with a four-point lead over incumbent Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) at 47-43 in the Maine Senate race and Mark Kelly leading Sen. Martha McSally (R-AR) 47-42 in the Arizona Senate race. In the poll conducted in Maine, Collins’ approval rating sits at 33 percent, with 57 percent of voters expressing disapproval of her job performance. In the Arizona poll, PPP found McSally to have a 37 percent job approval rating while 46 percent stated they disapprove of her performance in office. Kelly, who is running to unseat McSally, received a greater favorability rating of 41 percent, while 29 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. The poll also found a correlation between President Donald Trump’s approval rating in Arizona and Maine with that of McSally and Collins. The poll noted, “In Maine only 42 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing to 56 percent who disapprove, and in Arizona only 45 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing to 51 percent who disapprove.” In addition to the results found in Maine and Arizona, Public Policy Polling also found Cal Cunningham with a lead over incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) at 46-41 in the North Carolina Senate race and John Hickenlooper with a lead over Cory Gardner (R-CO) at 51-38 in the Colorado Senate race. Should the Democrats successfully take these four GOP seats currently held by Collins, McSally, Tillis, and Gardner, and lose in Alabama where Sen. Doug Jones’ (D-AL) seat is at stake—assuming nothing else changes – the Vice President next year would cast the tie-breaking vote to decide the majority.

"Hilary Rosen, the Democrat strategist who once attacked Ann Romney for being a stay-at-home mom, apologized Friday to Nina Turner, spokesperson for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), for a racially-charged shouting match on CNN. But for the Sanders campaign, it was not enough. The two had argued Thursday evening on Chris Cuomo’s Prime Time over the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., after Turner suggested that former Vice President Joe Biden was the “white moderate” that King had warned about in his famous “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” Rosen countered that Turner was not qualified to invoke the civil rights leader against Biden. “You don’t have that standing. I’m sorry, you don’t.” Turner resounded angrily: “Don’t tell me what kind of standing I have as a black woman in America. … How dare you, as a white woman.” As the Daily Caller noted, Rosen apologized — but deleted the tweet because it referred to “angry black women,” which some readers found offensive. Sanders demanded an apology directly from Biden on Friday afternoon: .@JoeBiden must accept responsibility for his surrogate telling our campaign co-chair Senator @NinaTurner that she doesn't have standing to invoke the words of Dr. King. That is unacceptable and Joe must apologize to Nina and all the people of color supporting our campaign. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 6, 2020  In 2012, Rosen apologized to Ann Romney, wife of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, for mocking her by saying she had “never worked a day in her life.” Joel B.

"Police are searching for a group of suspects who allegedly stomped on a teenage girl lying on a sidewalk in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday. Surveillance footage showed the group of suspects surround a 15-year-old girl on Utica Avenue in Crown Heights and repeatedly attack her as she lay on the pavement, according to CBS New York. At the beginning of the video, one suspect ran toward the girl and stomped on her as she curled up in the fetal position and tried to protect herself. Seconds later, several other suspects approached and kicked her repeatedly. As the crowd began to disperse, a man wearing jeans and a green shirt bent down and pulled off her shoes, then walked away from the scene. The suspects also reportedly stole the young woman’s cell phone and debit card. “The victim was taken to the hospital with bruising and swelling to her face,” the report said. Friday morning, the New York Police Department (NYPD) tweeted the video and asked residents for help in identifying the suspects: 🚨WANTED for ROBBERY/GANG ASSAULT: On 3/5, at approx 4:10 PM, in front of 216 Utica Ave in Brooklyn, a 15-year-old female was approached by a group of individuals & was punched & kicked to the ground & had her property removed.

In February, New York City residents told Mayor Bill de Blasio during a town hall event that they are fed up with the growing crime rate and asked him to work with state lawmakers to abolish the new bail reform law, Breitbart News reported. “Many people are being beaten, slashed, and hurt by criminals being released. They said they would only release people that are non-violent but they’re releasing people who are very, very violent,” one resident said. “New York City is becoming a crime city. Could you please get rid of bail reform to make our city safer?” she asked him. Despite their concerns, de Blasio claimed people who believe the crime rate is increasing were “not interested in the facts” and accused them of “whipping up fear.” However, the NYPD said Thursday that the state’s bail reform law was mostly to blame for the recent spike in crime, according to the New York Post.  “Criminal justice reforms serve as a significant reason New York City has seen this uptick in crime,” the department stated.","VIDEO: Suspects Stomp, Kick Teenage Girl on Brooklyn Sidewalk",2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/03/06/video-suspects-stomp-kick-teenage-girl-on-brooklyn-sidewalk/,Breitbart
"The left-wing Hollywood celebrities are stoking public hysteria over the coronavirus, using social media to spread fear as well as disinformation about President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly global outbreak. While some stars are using the coronavirus to re-air their hatred of all things Trump, many other celebrities are fanning the flames by making false claims about President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, accusing the White House of lying to the American public and exacerbating the problem. Comedian Chelsea Handler repeated the false claim that President Trump suggested that people who have “tested positive for coronavirus can still go to work and get better there.” Trump supporters: your president just suggested people who have tested positive for the Coronavirus can still go to work and get better there. Go with god. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 5, 2020  But President Trump never said or suggested what Handler claims he did. The president was speaking during an interview this week on Fox News’ Hannity in which he described some situations in which people who have contracted coronavirus only experience a mild case of the illness and quickly recover. President Trump said that some of these people chose to go to work and eventually got better, but he never recommended that they do so. “So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better,” Trump said. I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC.

But Fauci has denied the claim, saying during a recent White House briefing: “Let me clarify. I have never been muzzled — ever.” He said that the rumor arose out of a misunderstanding. “We were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, ‘Let’s regroup and figure out how we’re going to be communicating.’ So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared.” But Tony Fauci – head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH for 36 yrs now (!) – needs Mike Pence's approval to speak publicly.

"A court in a German city has ruled that the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD) will be allowed to erect a statue of Vladimir Lenin, the mass-murdering founder of the Soviet Union. The administrative court in Gelsenkirchen overruled the city’s decision to halt the construction of a monument to Vladimir Lenin, the architect of the Russian Revolution of 1917 which birthed the Soviet Union — a state responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of innocent people. The city had argued that the statue would detract from the historical value of the adjacent savings bank building, but the court ruled that objections over Lenin’s historical atrocities were irrelevant as the statue is to be constructed more than ten meters away from the bank, Deutsche Welle reports. The Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany hailed the decision by the court, saying: “A few weeks before his 150th birthday, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin has once again won a great victory.” The move by the court was slammed by Marco Buschmann, a Free Democrats (FDP) member of parliament from Gelsenkirchen, who said: “A Lenin statue would be a disgrace for Gelsenkirchen” as “Lenin stands for mass murder and totalitarianism.” “Anyone who wants to erect a Lenin statue should ask themselves whether they are still grounded in liberal democratic principles or not,” he added.

The statue was first installed in the city in the early 1990s after a local man purchased the statue following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Benedict Evans, a local venture capitalist, and over 900 people in a Facebook group named “Seattle, Tear Down This Lenin Statue!” called for the removal of the monument to the communist dictator. “If one wanted to pull down statues of profoundly evil people, responsible for uncountable human suffering, this one might be on the list,” Evans wrote. Lenin’s reign as the head of the Soviet Union was marked by mass starvation, the internment of political enemies in gulags (concentration camps), the mass executions of the Red Terror, and the invasion of neighbouring countries. In his persecution of the kulaks — peasants with over eight acres of land — Lenin ordered his men in one instance to: “1) hang without fail, so that the public sees, at least 100 notorious kulaks, the rich, and the bloodsuckers. 2) Publish their names. 3) Take away all of their grain. 4) Execute the hostages.” “This needs to be accomplished in such a way, that people for hundreds of miles around will see, tremble, know and scream out: let’s choke and strangle those blood-sucking kulaks,” Lenin commanded.

A majority, 53%, said that Sanders was their second choice, followed by 32% who said Biden was their second choice, 5% who chose Gabbard, and 10% who were undecided as to who their second choice candidate will be. Despite Biden’s edge, the greatest proportion of likely Democrat voters, 43 percent, are supportive of Medicare for All — a hallmark of Sanders’ campaign. “When asked which candidate had the best healthcare policy, Sanders lead with 43% and Biden followed at 40%,” Emerson reported.

"Swedish populist leader Jimmie Åkesson has been reported to the police for inciting “hate” after handing out “Sweden is full” flyers in Turkey this week. Swedish attorney Behrang Eslami reported the Sweden Democrat (SD) leader to the police, claiming that Åkesson was engaging in incitement against a group of people by handing out the flyers near Turkey’s border with Greece. “I believe that it is everyone’s right to seek asylum in Europe or in Sweden,” Elsami told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. “To go down and try to persuade people, who are fleeing for their lives and in need, not to go to Europe. It is in principle wrong and it violates human rights,” he claimed. Åkesson responded to the police report, telling broadcaster TV4, in comments reported by Nyheter Idag, that he considered himself a voice for many Swedes, pointing to recent opinion polls that have shown his party as the most popular in the country. Swedish Populist Leader Hands Out ‘Sweden Is Full’ Flyers in Turkey https://t.co/kYSdYhi75L — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2020  “I think it is pretty clear when you look at opinion polls and other things that the Swedish people want a more restrictive immigration policy than the one we have had so far,” he said. Lawyer Anton Strand, who was hired by Åkesson, also dismissed the police complaint, telling Nyheter Idag: “It seems to me that people have sought attention rather than wanted to make a serious complaint.” “Notifying a person without basis can in itself constitute a criminal act and my client is also considering reporting the lawyer to the Law Society,” he added. Åkesson’s handing out of the flyers, which stated, “Sweden is full. Don’t come to us! We can’t give you more money or provide housing. Sorry about this message,” is not the first time a country or politicians have tried to dissuade migrants from coming to Europe. In 2018, Belgium launched a social media campaign directed at migrants, stating that many of the promises made by people-traffickers about Europe were actually myths.

"Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) stumped for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at a rally in Detroit, Michigan, on Friday, encouraging supporters to mobilize their friends and family and declaring that it would “feel good to have a president that you didn’t have to check” all the time. Tlaib stumped for the presidential hopeful on Friday in her home state ahead of its upcoming March 10 primary. “This is a once in a lifetime moment in our country to elect someone who won’t sell us out,” she said to cheers. “It would feel good to have a president that you didn’t have to check him all the time,” she continued, instructing the energized crowd to mobilize their friends and family members: 2020 is about showing up for others folks. It really is, because when you cast that vote, please know that vote isn’t just for you. It’s for the kids— kids caged at the border. It’s for that mother that doesn’t know how she can afford insulin for her daughter, for her children. “It’s for all of the people now living in poverty. It’s for my neighbors right here in Detroit that get their water shut off, their kids taken away the following day. Show up for her,” she continued. Tlaib praised Sanders for taking on the “wealthy” and “powerful” and predicted that he will win Michigan. “He’s winning states all over the country, and he’s about to win Michigan,” she said, promising that “another world is possible.” Sanders, for his part, delivered a typical stump speech, calling President Trump a “pathological liar,” “bully,” and “vindictive person.” He also accused him of running a “corrupt administration”:  Michigan, offering 125 delegates, is one of six states voting Tuesday.",Rashida Tlaib: ‘It Would Feel Good to Have a President that You Didn’t Have to Check’ All the Time,2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/rashida-tlaib-feel-good-have-president-didnt-have-check-all-time/,Breitbart
"MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak during his Friday broadcast. Hayes said, “Consider this: how does anyone–you, me, Vice President Pence–know how to handle a situation if we don’t know the full scope? We have had three months to prepare for the coronavirus to come to the U.S. and see how outbreaks started. We have completely failed. The federal government have completely failed until now. We are weeks and weeks behind where we should be.” After comparing the coronavirus outbreak to Chernobyl and Hurricane Maria, Hayes played a clip of Trump being asked about a cruise ship docked off the California coast with coronavirus patients. Trump said, “I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather — because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship … I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off.” Hayes said, “He’s saying that his preference, in defiance of the experts, is that the sick Americans stay marooned on the boat because he doesn’t want the numbers going up for him… All he cares about at the numbers, not the actual problem.” He concluded, “You cannot spin a virus. Countries like China learned that early on. Spinning is all our president knows. This is what happens when you elect a BS artist to the most important job in the country. He has BSed his way through his entire career. He has BSed his way through a crisis, and he is trying to BS his way through this one so here we are.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",MSNBC’s Hayes: ‘BS Artist’ Trump Coronavirus Response ‘Completely Failed’,2020-03-06,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/06/msnbcs-hayes-bs-artist-trump-coronavirus-response-completely-failed/,Breitbart
"Democrat voters must determine if Joe Biden is “mentally fit” to serve as President of the United States given the former vice president’s frequently slurred speech and regular misstatements, assessed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas. Biden’s Super Tuesday performance — winning 566 delegates relative to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 501 delegates — is not the result of a strengthening campaign but of a division among Democrat primary voter support between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), determined Pollak. Pollak then highlighted questions of Biden’s cognition given the former vice president’s behavior: Biden doesn’t look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign. On the stage last night — I was at his victory party in Los Angeles — he, at one moment, appeared to confuse his wife and his sister. He slurred his speech. He didn’t seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign. “He did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter,” noted Pollak, referring to Biden’s failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America’s founding documents. Pollak continued: I’m being serious, here. I’m not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They’re going to do whatever it takes to be competitive. Pollak added, “Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job. When you put [Trump and Biden] side-by-side on stage, Biden comes out very poorly, and I don’t think there’s very much Democrats can do to change that.” Thomas highlighted Biden’s “cognitive function” and ability “to be sharp and quick on his feet” as noticeably lacking. Thomas asked if Sanders’ supporters would go with a possible Democrat nomination of Biden as the party’s presidential nominee. “Initially my feeling was that [Sanders supporters] would sit it out. They did not like Biden. They really didn’t like Pete Buttigieg. They  don’t like Elizabeth Warren. Early surveys suggested that the Sanders voters were the least likely to stick with the party nominee. “ What we do know is that right now the Bernie Sanders camp feels that they’re the victims of a coup,” Pollak added, noting Marianne Williamson use of the term. “They feel the Democratic establishment has maneuvered once again to try to steal the election from them, and they’re fighting that.” Pollak stated, “It’s very clear — if it wasn’t before — the Democratic establishment is pulling a lot of strings behind the scenes and really, they’re barely even trying to hide it anymore. You’re going to see a lot more shouting before all this is done.” Thomas praised Breitbart News as a “great site.” “I rely on your site regularly,” he said. “I encourage my listeners to bookmark it. You’re a thorn in the side of a left-wing media and it’s refreshing. It’s always reliable information, much to the chagrin of what leftists say about Breitbart. It’s very accurate information, and I’m pleased you’re there.” The Brian Thomas Show, which broadcasts live on AM station 55KRC in Cincinnati from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern, is available any time nationwide via iHeartRADIO.

"Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ripped into his former political party, the Democrats, and laid out why he considers himself now a “Trumpocrat” in a broad, nearly 30-minute-long exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Saturday morning. Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Blagojevich—whose sentence President Donald Trump commuted last month, releasing him from federal prison—laid out how his old political party has “abandoned” American workers and black voters. Blagojevich said a number of policies his former party’s leaders, from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to former Vice President Joe Biden to even his home-state Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), have put forward have hurt African Americans and working class Americans economically and socially—and now that he is out of prison, and clear of the Democrat Party machine, he is speaking out against it all. What’s more, Blagojevich says the great irony of American politics is that Trump—a Republican—has done more to rectify these problems that Democrats created for black and working class Americans than any of America’s other recent presidents, in large part because Trump has ditched the “traditional” GOP playbook to pursue a more solutions-oriented agenda. Upon his release from prison, Blagojevich announced he is a “Trumpocrat”–making him the highest profile such Democrat who has left the Democratic Party to join President Trump–and here he explains his views in the most in-depth interview yet since his release. “When I say I’m a Trumpocrat—and hopefully a lot of others are as well, and I believe they are—it’s largely because the Democratic Party has not only left us but it’s abandoned traditional Democratic constituencies like working people, factory workers like my father an immigrant who came to America and spent all of his time here as a working man working in a steel factory,” Blagojevich said. “And also, the Democratic Party has for far too long taken the African American community for granted. They’ve not only abandoned them, they’ve sold them out when they passed the crime bill in 1994 that President Clinton and Vice President Biden, then-Senator Biden backed and voted for. Our senator here, Sen. Durbin, voted for it. It’s a bill that led to the mass incarceration of a whole new generation of African American men for nonviolent first-time drug offenses, over-sentencing them and then putting them in a position where they can have no opportunity whatsoever to begin a new life after correcting the mistakes that they made and paying their debts to society, frankly, for the crimes that they committed. President Trump, interestingly enough, is speaking to those constituencies in ways that traditional Republicans never did.” Blagojevich said that whether it’s through his economic policies or his criminal justice reform policies or other norm-challenging fights, Trump has upended the normal political battle lines in a way that is “revolutionizing American politics” and “re-aligning” what would be considered “traditional” political coalitions by zoning in on and successfully “drawing from” what were considered “Democratic constituency groups.” “And I think he’s not only been successful politically because he’s done it, I think he’s revolutionizing American politics,” Blagojevich said. “He’s re-aligning politics in America by drawing from those traditional Democratic constituency groups, the factory worker that used to work in a factory that’s gone because of the 1994 NAFTA bill that President Clinton signed sending all those jobs away. President Trump is bringing them back in places like western Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin and southern Illinois—the rust belt states. One of the many frustrations I had as governor was when I would leave the Chicagoland area where I’m from—I’m from Chicago—and I’d visit places like the Quad Cities or Marion, Illinois, or Franklin County, Illinois, where they used to have coal mines and people were working and that was the economic anchor of the community or you’d go to a place like Galesburg, Illinois, where the Maytag factory once was but has left because of NAFTA and President Clinton and the policies of the Democratic Party that’s supposed to be the party that protected those people and looked out for their interests. It’s hard to be able to explain to those communities that there was hope, that there was a possibility that we might be able to bring some of those economic engines back to the state. Now, at last, we have a president who not only promised to do it but he’s doing it. I think President Trump is making real strides in succeeding in that but more importantly he’s actually addressing the needs of the American worker. And with the First Step Act, he’s actually done something for a community that overwhelming votes for Democrats like me. We easily get 90 percent or better of the African American vote when we run against Republicans. Yet, the Democratic Party I would say cynically has taken the African American community for granted. It’s almost immoral, their treatment of the African American community by sort of just keeping them dependent and in a certain place where they have to look to government for all the answers when at the same it’s actually government through over-sentencing and targeting African Americans that are causing a lot of the problems and conditions in these very communities.” Blagojevich served almost eight years of a 14-year sentence handed down after multiple trials finally resulted in partial convictions, some of which were later vacated on appeal. The first time they came at Blagojevich, he was convicted on only one of 24 charges—the charge was lying to the FBI, something the agency has similarly used to target Trump allies in the various scandals he’s been entangled in—but then prosecutors retried him on 20 counts and he was convicted on 17 of them, acquitted on one, and on the other two no verdict was rendered. Later, on appeal, five of the counts were vacated and Blagojevich’s lawyers continued fighting for years to try to get the Supreme Court to hear them. But eventually, it was Trump in early 2020 who commuted his sentence—and let him out after eight years behind bars. Blagojevich to this day insists he did nothing wrong, and that what he was put away for was politics as usual. In fact the core allegation that he tried to sell Obama’s U.S. Senate seat when Obama was president-elect and Blagojevich was to appoint Obama’s successor, was one of the conviction charges vacated—or overturned—on appeal. But the broader point Blagojevich tells with this story is that there is a serious problem in America’s criminal justice system, and what happened to him could happen to anyone. “On this subject, sadly and unfortunately it took this long—I had this experience I had to endure and I will tell your listeners they put me in prison for things that are routine politics. I didn’t cross any lines,” Blagojevich said. “We were doing routine political things. The sale of the Senate seat was never a crime. That was reversed by the appellate court. I was there for some fundraising requests and they convicted me by moving the line and telling the jury you can be convicted for seeking a campaign contribution without any evidence of a promise or a threat because there was none. But anyway, having said all of that, this long unhappy experience has given me a unique perspective. I truly believe I am an expert witness on this. I have street cred having done eight years in prison and I spent the first 32 months in prison as probably the only governor in American history to be in a high security prison behind what the inmates call ‘the razor wire,’ where I spent nearly three years with over 900 inmates coming and going where some would leave and new ones would come in. They were largely drug dealers, gang-bangers, cartel members, there were bank robbers here, there men there who had committed murder, only two percent were so-called ‘white collar.’ So, I really got a firsthand lesson on real life and yes of course I met a lot of my fellow inmates—particularly drug dealers—who experienced over sentencing. Here’s a classic example, Jonair Moore, my friend who I just left behind is in his 11th year or actually just starting his 12th year of prison as part of a 26-year sentence as a first-time non-violent drug offender, a young African American man. Consider the fact that the average rapist in America serves no more than four years, and here’s Jonair—he’s not unusual, he’s actually the rule not the exception, sent to prison for a quarter of a century for a one-time mistake when no one was hurt. The system is broken and it disproportionately discriminates against African Americans. It’s what the author Michelle Alexander has called ‘The New Jim Crow in America.’” Trump, Blagojevich said, has done more to reform this broken system than any Democrat has—including the first black president, Obama—and he said it was Democrats who created the problem to begin with when Biden and Clinton and Durbin teamed up to push the 1994 crime bill that Obama did nothing to alleviate. “I’ll say this, this is one of the great ironies in modern history: On this issue, it’s actually Donald Trump who’s trumping the first African American president—Obama—and actually doing something to solve this problem and undo the racist injustice caused by that 1994 crime bill, which has led to the current conditions we’re facing,” Blagojevich said. “This was a bill Joe Biden not only voted for, but Joe Biden was a vocal advocate for and so were most of the leading Democrats including my senator here in Illinois Dick Durbin and of course President Clinton was the who signed it.” Asked if these actions by Trump on this front, and what Trump has done with the economy and school choice among other efforts are winning the president support in the black community, Blagojevich said that “my instincts tell me that it will and it will be a dramatic improvement among President Trump’s performance in the African American community among voters.” Democrats have usually won around 90 percent or more of the black vote in most elections. Trump won about eight percent in 2016, which, while better than failed 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s six percent that year, is still a very small percentage. “I’ve only been home a little over two weeks so I haven’t been as plugged into the community as I was in the good old days, but I have made an appearance on an African American radio station here in Chicago maybe the second or third day I was home and I got the sense there was a growing sense President Trump was someone who was actually addressing the problems in the African American community that they have gotten all too often almost accepting that they’re going to receive from the politicians they elected is just lip service,” Blagojevich said. “I think there’s a real sense among people, and it’s growing as the truth gets out, and I think there’s going to be more and more people in the African American community who see that this president, President Trump, is a very different kind of leader than a traditional politician. This is a guy who solves problems as opposed to making honestly—very too often, politicians make promises they have no intention of following through on to begin with. I think that when it comes to criminal justice reform, this is a case where this is a president who’s actually doing real meaningful things that’s leading to the end of over-sentencing of many African Americans in the system. I saw a few guys go home before I went home because of the First Step Act. In terms of the guys I went to prison with, are they seeing what President Trump is doing? The answer is: yes, they are. And I also think a lot of these guys like the fact that this is a president with a badass style and a guy that actually fights. I think they like that too, and that’s waking up a lot of people. They’re sick and tired of the BS.” Blagojevich, who was the home state governor of Obama’s Illinois in 2008, when the former president was first elected to the White House, and was the first governor in America to endorse him that year, also told Breitbart News he now considers it a mistake to have endorsed Obama. Blagojevich said that Obama promised all sorts of changes and hope for the country—“hope and change” were the now former president’s infamous campaign slogan—but Blagojevich says now upon reflection that Obama failed in every respect to bring either to the country, and that they were empty rhetorical catchphrases with no substance behind them. He said Trump, on the other hand, has actually delivered whereObama failed. “President Obama was elected in 2008. Here’s something I’ll plead guilty to: I was the first governor to endorse him,” Blagojevich said. “That I did, and it was wrong—but at the time I thought it was right. Obama’s election if you really think about it was based very little on detail. It was based on his themes ‘hope and change.’ People were sick and tired of the usual baloney in politics and fake solutions dressed up as solutions but they’re not real. ‘These guys are saying they did something for us somehow, but I’m not feeling it. Things continued to stay the same and the lobbyists and the insiders are all getting rich in Washington or in my case in Illinois in Springfield, but how come my tax bill is going up?’ Obama was elected because the American people felt they wanted change and this was a new candidate who was talking about hope and change. It wasn’t a lot of substance under it, but they were so hungry for change they took a leap of faith on President Obama and did something historic electing our first African American president in the history of our country—which is a very good thing for our country. It turns out however Obama was just that, all rhetoric. It was just a slogan. He didn’t do it. So I think that eight years later, when President Trump came down that escalator—I was watching that in prison on one of those televisions in prison—I felt the same way you did. He started to talk and then he didn’t back down. He was losing big because of some of the tough positions he was taking, but I was convinced at that time he was going to win. Now, you have a guy who’s not just saying he’s going to bring change—he’s bringing real hope that he’s going to stand up for something and take the hit and lose something for what he was going to get. It’s not real change unless you ruffle some feathers and make a few enemies. That I think is what President Trump is doing. I think some of the guys I was in prison with, African American guys who are seeing this new president as a very different kind of leader than Obama and frankly all the other ones that preceded President Trump leading up to his election.” Asked about the unique populist space that Trump has found in American politics, Blagojevich said he believes it is the future—whether it’s on trade deals like the USMCA, which got more than 380 votes in the House and 89 votes in the Senate, or on forthcoming major policy packages like infrastructure. He noted, too, that while he disagrees with the socialist solutions offered by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), he thinks that Sanders is zoning in on some of the core problems facing the country—and the culprits in Washington and on Wall Street behind such problems. “President Trump has filled that vacuum,” Blagojevich said. “That’s absolutely right. That’s what’s going on. You see it, frankly, even with Bernie Sanders and his supporters. He’s taken positions and views and he’s offered solutions to the problems that I think frankly are unworkable. History proves that socialism never works, and actually is counter-productive. But at least Bernie Sanders is actually talking about identifying some of the problems that are facing our country. Now, President Trump on the other hand is not only addressing those issues but he’s now the president and he’s actually achieving things and providing real, meaningful solutions that are leading to an economy that is booming because of the very things he has done whether it’s the tax cuts, reducing the regulations, and these trade deals—all are absolutely long overdue. Here again is an example of a different philosophy that Trump is offering to the American people and I think he’s speaking to a whole bunch of different people who frankly tuned out of the process long ago because they understand how full of baloney the political system has become for a long, long time. They’re now coming back into the political system.” Blagojevich added that Trump’s success is in large part marked by how many “enemies” he’s amassed in Washington trying to take him down and stop his progress. “You got a lot of voters who are not even being called by pollsters because they haven’t voted for several elections, but now because President Trump is actually bringing real change and actually keeping promises that he’s making and solving those problems and among the evidence that he’s doing it is that he’s got so many enemies that want to destroy him,” Blagojevich said. “One of the Roosevelt presidents, I think it was Franklin but it could have been Teddy, he said ‘ah, you have enemies. Good. That means you stand for something.’ The fact that President Trump is getting so much pushback and the opposition is so determined to destroy him—and that raise a whole bunch of other issues, and I’m also an expert witness on this and how when you go down and try to shake things up and change things the political establishment comes after you and destroys you personally, this is a real serious problem for another discussion—but the fact that President Trump is getting that kind of response and that the Democrats decided to abuse the impeachment process and use it as a political weapon frankly is a badge of honor for President Trump. It’s more evidence he’s doing what he said he was going to do and he’s changing things and they know it in that establishment in Washington and they don’t like it. So the more he keeps fighting and achieves things and changes things, like USMCA as you say in spite of all this opposition to be able to do the necessary things to get the bipartisan support to pass those trade deals, because he’s been able to use Twitter and the ability to communicate directly to the people, he’s been able to force those people like the operatives and congressmen in Washington to respond to his leadership and support some of his stuff because even though they don’t want to give him a political win they got to support this stuff to get re-elected. So yeah, I think there’s a tremendous space—a lot of room in that area—of those non-voters who tuned out a long time ago and I think you’re going to see President Trump being very successful in November and I think you’re going to see the number of votes that he gets will far exceed what he got the first time and a lot of those will be voters who haven’t been voting for a long time. A lot of them came out in 2016, but my prediction is a lot more of them will come out in 2020 since President Trump has proven to be different from the usual politicians. This is a guy who actually fights to get things done.” Blagojevich said that the same Democrat machine that targeted him—and Trump—is also trying to take down Sanders. That is because, he said, the Democrat Party is now “the party of Wall Street,” he said. “Absolutely, and it seems so transparent to me. This is the new Democratic Party, the Chuck Schumer-Nancy Pelosi Democratic Party,” Blagojevich said. “It’s the party—ready for this—of Wall Street. They’ve become the party of Wall Street. That’s why they sold out the American worker with NAFTA. They went to Wall Street because it’s loaded with campaign contributions. Now, the Democratic Party today because of the growth of the internet and online communications, now the Democratic Party is also the party of Silicon Valley—again, at the expense of the working person and family and the African American community because of some of the other things that they do. They cynically have abandoned the African American community and made a determination to keep that part of our nation dependent upon government in a way so that they have no other place to go but to vote for Democrats and the simple way for Democrats to keep them voting for them is call anybody who offers some kind of solution like school choice or other reforms like criminal justice reform, to call them racists. It’s a real cynical ugly kind of politics that the modern Democratic Party is engaged in. Of course they’re going to do anything they can to keep Bernie Sanders from winning and they’re going to be successful in doing it with the establishment ganging up on him. Bernie, again, is wrong on the solutions but at least he has the courage to raise the issues. I remember here’s where he was so right and I was so wrong. I remember when I was a brand new congressman back after 9/11, me and everybody else we all voted for the Patriot Act. Then there was Bernie Sanders, that crazy guy from Vermont—Bernie voted against the Patriot Act. I remember thinking how crazy he was. He was right, and we were wrong. That Patriot Act has led to the undermining of civil liberties, giving unchecked power of prosecutors who have weaponized their power and now criminalized routine practices motivated not by the desire to serve the interests of justice but instead to go after political enemies or people they want to bring down who are ruffling the feathers of the establishment. Frankly, what they did at the AAA level to a Democratic governor, to me—a lot of the same people, Comey, Fitzgerald, and Mueller, the same ones have been trying to do it at the major league level to a Republican president in President Trump. We have a lot of challenges ahead of us and the Democratic establishment abandoned these traditional voting groups and Bernie Sanders is going to pay a price because he’s got the chutzpah enough to challenge and raise questions that frankly question the establishment.” For Blagojevich, for now, he is unclear about the future—he says he wants to write a book or two, and find a way to help champion the issues he cares about–especially criminal justice reform. But one thing he is certain of: He is “everlastingly grateful” to Trump for having the “testicular virility” that he says Obama did not ever have to right the wrong he considers was done to him by the criminal justice system. “I’m not sure, it’s all very new, I’ve never come out of prison before so after eight years it’s a new experience,” Blagojevich said. “I hope to write a book or two—I’d like to write a book about my experience and what I’ve learned along the way. I think I can offer a unique perspective. I’d also like to write a book about helping people through their struggles and adversity because I share with them how I found the inspiration and the strength and purpose that worked through the long dark wilderness that I was in. I’d like maybe to be able to do something like that that could be helpful to people. I’d like to fight for criminal justice reform and I do believe I have a lot I can say about that from both sides, as a former governor where we did certain things but could have done so much more but also what I went through and have come out of. Right now, I’m doing this thing called Cameo where you do shout-outs to people and it’s a way to earn a living and it’s actually kind of nice because I’ll get a request from a daughter and she wants to celebrate her mother’s birthday so she’ll ask ‘hey governor can you say to my mother you’re a great mother and thank you for raising us children and loving us as you have?’ So you bring a little smile on the faces of people who make these requests, so that’s been nice. But in terms of what I’m going to do in the way of something lasting, it’s unclear right now. It’s all very new. But let me say this—whatever it is, it’s way better than what it was. There’s nothing like being home and being with your family and I’m blessed to be with my daughters and with my wife Patti who are the purpose and inspiration for me to come out and find a way back home. I’m grateful, everlastingly grateful, to President Trump again for having the testicular virility to trump Obama and do the right thing.” LISTEN TO FORMER ILLINOIS GOV.

"Politico continued the media’s effort to trash President Donald Trump’s response to coronavirus, citing “current and former officials” Saturday who fault the president for what they call “Trump-inspired disorganization.” The sources for Dan Diamond’s article Saturday evening are described as “13 current and former officials, as well as individuals close to the White House” — remarkably similar to the “10 current and former Trump administration officials, as well as two people close to the administration” cited in Diamond’s Feb. 26 article attacking Centers for Disease Control (CDC) director Robert Redfield. The article begins by attacking President Trump for disagreeing with Vice President Mike Pence about whether to evacuate passengers off a cruise chip near California, the Grand Princess, on which coronavirus had broken out. The president, Politico reports, wanted to keep the passengers on the ship, though he ultimately deferred to Pence as leader of the nation’s coronavirus fight. What Diamond does not note is that Politico — among others — devoted extensive coverage to criticisms of the decision to evacuate Americans last month from another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined in Japan. That is the context in which the administration is making similar decisions. The fact that President Donald Trump is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn’t suggests that there is something other than reasonable criticism on offer. Politico faults the Trump administration for “failing to secure enough testing to head off a coronavirus outbreak in the United States,” a claim that — if true — would be laid at the feet of the CDC. But while admitting that, Politico uses “current and former officials” to say that Trump’s “atmosphere” at the White House is really to blame. The “atmosphere,” Politico alleges, is one that discourages officials from giving the president bad news. But that fails to distinguish between how the government functions under Trump from how it functions under anyone else. (There were similar allegations of a bad “atmosphere” during the Obama administration when it came to intelligence reports about the fight against the so-called “Islamic State.” An inspector general’s report later found that there had been no deliberate attempts by the Obama White House to distort the intelligence, but that a perception that the administration did not want to hear “bad news” led intelligence analysts to self-censor in some of their reporting.) Politico also faults Trump for failing to appoint “a sole leader to fight the outbreak, as President Barack Obama did with Ebola in 2014.” The implication is that Obama did a good job with Ebola. But the Obama administration was perceived at the time to have bungled the response, and only belatedly put Ron Klain, a political staffer with no relevant experience, in charge.
Diamond also criticizes Trump for replacing his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, with Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), in the midst of a crisis. While it is not clear that had anything to do with coronavirus, one of the hallmarks of Trump’s administration has been the swift removal of people perceived to be doing less than the best job possible. It may not be how “politicos” think Washington ought to function, but it is how the business world works — and it is part of the reason Americans elected Trump. (Arguably, it has worked, and is working.) Politico‘s latest criticism is indistinguishable from hundreds of others that have appeared in the mainstream media since the president took office, driven by unnamed sources with apparent axes to grind and vague complaints about the president’s management style. In a similar vein, the Washington Post accused the Trump administration Saturday of “squander[ing] time” in the fight against the virus, after even the New England Journal of Medicine said that early travel restrictions “may have helped slow the spread of the virus.” The Post‘s sources: “16 current and former administration officials.”
In an atmosphere where Trump’s critics have a strong incentive to a) inflame the crisis, and b) blame it on him, it is remarkable how little the method of criticism has changed. Joel B.

"During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA) touted the coronavirus aid package and vowed House Democrats “will remain vigilant in our oversight of the administration’s efforts to ensure a thorough response that keeps Americans safe and healthy.” Transcript as Follows:  “Hello, I’m Dr. Raul Ruiz, and I represent California’s 36th Congressional District. I’m also an emergency doctor, public health expert and disaster aid specialist with medical, public health and public policy degrees from Harvard. In 2009, I was working in the emergency department when our nation was combatting the H1N1 pandemic. There, on the frontlines, I saw firsthand how important a coordinated, comprehensive, government-wide response is to addressing public health threats like the one we are currently facing. In situations like this, we must prepare for the worst as we work for the best. That’s why this week, House Democrats took early and decisive action to protect the health of the American people by passing the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act. This aid package allocates $8.3 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak, including: more than $3 billion for research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics; $2.2 billion in public health funding for prevention, preparedness and response efforts; and nearly $1 billion in support of state and local health agencies, who are on the frontlines, working night and day to defend our nation’s health. House Democrats’ aid package provides funds to reimburse state and local governments – like Riverside County in my district – for their expenses incurred while assisting with the federal response. This rapid reimbursement is essential for readiness capacity to prevent future outbreaks and treat this disease. We have passed a comprehensive funding aid package to help our public health infrastructure—but House Democrats’ work doesn’t end there. We will remain vigilant in our oversight of the Administration’s efforts to ensure a thorough response that keeps Americans safe and healthy. While Congress has passed a comprehensive supplemental to address the coronavirus, there are steps you can take personally to help keep you and your family safe and healthy. Knowledge is power. And knowing the facts about transmission and prevention reduces anxiety and empowers you to protect yourself and your community. CDC.gov is the best source of information. There, you’ll find real-time updates on the number of coronavirus cases and critical information from our nation’s leading public health experts on mitigating the spread of the virus. There are also simple things that you can do every day to protect yourself and our most vulnerable populations, like people over 60, people with weakened immune systems and people with underlying conditions like diabetes, heart and lung disease. As a physician, here’s what I’d tell my patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19: wash your hands often with warm water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue you can discard, then immediately wash your hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and, if you feel sick, stay home; and, also, clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. With these basic practices, you can and will make a difference in combatting this disease. America—we can do this. Together, we can defend our nation’s health. And, together, we can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. House Democrats are continuing to work hard For The People every day, to protect you and your family’s health—and make sure communities across our nation have the resources they need to stay safe and healthy. We have your back. Thank you.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",Dem Rep.

"A Georgia Republican lawmaker has introduced a bill that would make child transgender surgeries and drugs illegal. On February 27, Georgia State Rep. Ginny Ehrhart (R) introduced the Vulnerable Child Protection Act (HB 1060) in the Georgia House of Representatives. The legislation would ban health care professionals from performing transgender surgeries on a minor child – such as mastectomy, vaginoplasty, castration, penectomy, etc. – “for the purpose of attempting to affirm the minor’s perception of such minor’s sex, if that perception is inconsistent with such minor’s sex.” In addition, the bill would make illegal the administering of medications, such as puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones, to children for the same purpose.  “This form of child abuse is becoming a serious problem in Georgia and is evolving into a national crisis,” Ehrhart told the local CBS affiliate about her bill in October. She added: We are talking about children who have not reached the legal age of consent yet are being subjected to life-altering, irreversible surgeries and drug treatments that render them sterile and permanently disfigured. The psychological damage this does to innocent children must come to an end. This legislation makes such abusive actions criminal. Vernadette Broyles, president and general counsel of the Child and Parental Rights Campaign (CPRC), told Breitbart News in an interview the bill was partly modeled after one that came close to passing in South Dakota. Broyles’ nonprofit, public interest law firm, one she founded to defend the rights of parents to protect their children from the harms of gender ideology, was involved in the drafting of the bill. “Tremendous amounts of research went into this bill,” she said. “Medical, scientific research, and it was vetted by a variety of doctors and specialists.” Broyles said the legislation would include criminal penalties for medical professionals providing transgender drugs or surgeries to minor children, as well as the possibility of review by professional boards and for civil liability. However, the attorney added CPRC’s concern “is not the speed with which this bill precedes.” “It is more important to lay the important groundwork and to educate both legislators and Georgians about these harmful interventions that have been happening in the dark and about which most Georgians are not aware,” she explained. Broyles said her organization has been responding to what, in some cases, is “the wholesale trampling on parental rights.” As Breitbart News reported in October 2018, Broyles, working with the Georgia Adoption and Family Law Practice, co-filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department, one that focused on the sexual assault of a kindergarten girl in a Decatur school district that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. In that case, which is still working its way through the education department’s Office for Civil Rights, the mother of a five-year-old girl alleged that her daughter was sexually assaulted by a “gender-fluid” boy in the girls’ bathroom in November 2017. Broyles said: So, we began to look more closely into what’s going on in schools, and that it wasn’t just the private facilities use, that it was now in other aspects of the school, where various school systems were allowing [transgender] activists into the school, or they were allowing their teachers or their administrators to be trained by activists, such that they were bringing in either curriculum or just a mindset similar to evangelism. “I use that term very deliberately because this thing has some similar aspects to a religious belief and a cult,” the attorney added. “It’s not grounded in science, it’s grounded in a very subjective, personal metaphysical belief.” Broyles said many parents are now seeing teachers or administrators “proselytizing” this transgender belief system in their children’s schools. She said: It’s coming through a variety of different avenues into the school system, but they’re using it to indoctrinate a whole different world view of the very nature of homo sapiens. That’s one of the reasons why transgender ideology is so harmful, is that it is indoctrinating children in a worldview that says there are no boundaries. Broyles explained that her law firm comes to this issue from both a child development and children’s basic civil rights perspective, rather than a political or faith viewpoint. “Children have a central right, that should be protected, to be taught the truth about science and biology,” she asserted, adding: They have a very basic right to view their body not as their enemy, and their biological sex not as a disease. A child has the right to know that his or her biological sex is not a disease and that puberty is not a disorder. Broyles said the other danger gender ideology has created in many schools is the perspective that parents are an enemy to their children, rather than their primary advocates. She discussed situations in which some school districts are actually instructing teachers not to inform parents of a minor child’s change in “gender identity” at school. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty recently filed a lawsuit, on behalf of a group of parents, against the Madison Metropolitan School District, claiming the district violated parental rights by implementing a policy that allows children to change their gender identity without parental notice or consent. “What we’re encountering is schools having a presumption that not only are parents a potential danger to their children, or parents do not have the children’s best interests at heart, but also that it is the schools that know better,” Broyles said. “That’s putting the keys to the car in the child’s hands,” she said. “And also, automatically, the presumption is that parents are a potential threat and danger to their children.”","Georgia Bill Would Make Child Transgender Surgeries, Drugs Illegal",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/georgia-bill-would-make-child-transgender-surgeries-drugs-illegal/,Breitbart

Sanders described the president, as he has in past stump speeches, as a “pathological liar” and accused him of “moving this country into an autocracy.” While Sanders told supporters that he and his opponent, Joe Biden (D) are “friends,” he said they have different vision and records, citing the former vice president’s past positions on the Iraq War, trade agreements, and Social Security, as well as his support from super PACs and billionaires. Despite that, Sanders said Democrats will get behind the eventual nominee because the differences between those within the party are “far, far less” than the differences with this “dangerous” president. Sanders also touted his ultra-progressive positions, including his “100 percent pro-choice” voting record, promising to never appoint a judge who is not “100 percent pro-Roe v. Wade.” He also promised to “expand” funding for Planned Parenthood. The Vermont senator also harped on climate change — one of the central issues of his campaign. “Instead of spending $1.8 trillion a year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change,” he said, prompting chants of “Bernie.” Sanders added that he is prepared to take on the “whole damn one percent.” Watch the full rally below: ","Bernie Sanders Draws Crowd of 15,000 in Chicago: Trump Is ‘Moving this Country into an Autocracy’",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/bernie-sanders-draws-crowd-of-15000-in-chicago-trump-is-moving-this-country-into-an-autocracy/,Breitbart
"Super Bowl champion, businessman, and Utah Fourth Congressional District Republican candidate Burgess Owens joined Breitbart News Saturday, where he discussed the remaining Democrat presidential candidates and President Donald Trump’s commitment to all Americans. “We have a choice now between a full-fledged communist and a socialist Marxist,” Owens told host Matthew Boyle in regards to Democrat presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “This is the Democratic Party that chose these guys,” Owens continued, adding that neither of them understand “what we the people are going through.” Burgess also offered advice to those Democrats who “still love our country” and suggested that they reassess their decisions and think about whether the Democrat Party is the party they “want to be a part of.”  “I think the best decision we have been given today is Bernie Sanders or Biden against our president,” Burgess said. “They have a stark difference in the vision of our country. One is going toward pro-American, Judeo-Christian values, capitalism, and the other going Marxist, socialist, and anti-God, so it’s a good place to be.” Owens also praised President Trump for his efforts in making the American dream a possibility for all Americans. “Now that we have a president that has shown America within three years how an America-loving president should look like, they don’t know what to do next,” Owens said. “Democrats are like a wounded animal and they’re dangerous. A wounded animal is frantic. It’s crazy; it doesn’t know what to do next and that’s what’s happening to the left. They’re doing stuff that’s crazy now. They’re going further and further to the left thinking that America is going to be with them, and there’s no way it’s going to happen. Just get ready for a great turnout.” Owens also outlined Booker T. Washington’s “playbook” and related his tenants to that of President Trump’s, adding that what Washington worked so hard to attain for America is now “being seen within the Trump administration.” “Think about how angry and mean these people are,” Burgess said, jumping back to the conversation on the remaining Democrats running for president. “They’re not bringing hope.” “Don’t trust those guys,” Burgess said. “What they will do to the rest of our country is what they did to my community. What they’re doing to Chicago, Baltimore, around the world, the misery that comes with Venezuela, you name it.” Burgess also claimed neither Sanders nor Biden “have any common sense or desire to love our nation.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.","Burgess Owens: Sanders, Biden Have No ‘Common Sense or Desire to Love Our Nation’",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/burgess-owens-sanders-biden-have-no-desire-to-love-our-nation/,Breitbart

"Johns Hopkins University experts held a press briefing on Friday on Capitol Hill to discuss efforts to confront coronavirus as it spreads around the globe, including the launch of a website with an interactive dashboard that collects data worldwide about the virus, including data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).   Lauren Gardner, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, led the team that designed the dashboard, which has a wide range of always-updating data, from the number of confirmed cases (105,559), the number of deaths from the virus (3,555), the number of people who have recovered (58,354) and cases by region and country. Gardner said that statistics about users of the dashboard shows that the public is mostly using it “looking for reliable, factual information.” But local, state and federal governments, public health agencies — “and pretty much everything in between” are also using it, Gardner said. Statistics show people in the United States account for the majority of users. Gardner said her team has been taken aback but just how popular the dashboard has become. “It’s been pretty popular for awhile,” Gardner said. “At the moment we’re getting well over a billion requests per day — or interactions with this dashboard on a daily basis.” “It’s gone viral on almost every social media channel that exists,” Gardner said. “So I think that this really speaks to this huge demand for reliable, trustworthy, objective information especially around situations like these,” Gardner said.  Lauren Gardner, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, spoke about a new website the school has launched. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News) Others experts on the panel included Jason Farley, professor in the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing; Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Lisa Maragakis, epidemiologist and senior director of infection prevention for the Johns Hopkins Health System; and Andy Pekosz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Panelists called for public calm and warned about the danger of misinformation that is pumped out daily online, including on social media, where Pekosz said health experts have been engaging in conversations to try to get the facts out. Inglesby said there remains “substantial work” that still needs to be done to make the U.S. health infrastructure capable of handling the virus. And, according to Ingelsby, a vaccine that can be made available widely to the public is still 12 to 18 months out. The panel distributed literature that included tips to stop the spread of the virus, including avoiding contact with people who are sick; coughing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue properly; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; clean and disinfect objects and surfaces; stay home when sick except to seek medical help; and wash your hands with soap frequently for at least 20 seconds.

She was also snubbed by CNN’s town hall series despite the liberal network inviting former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, whose polling was lower than hers,” the article said. Following Gabbard’s request, Twitter users voiced their displeasure with the DNC’s decision to update the debate qualifications. “I don’t particularly like your politics – but I suspect Senile Joe and Comrade Sanders are deathly afraid that you’d be seen as a much more viable candidate than them if you were up there on the stage with them,” one person wrote. “Tulsi, you qualified, you deserve to be on that stage. I hate that the elite of the Democratic Party keeps doing this to you,” another commented.","Tulsi Gabbard Asks Biden, Sanders to Demand DNC Allow Her on Debate Stage",2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/07/tulsi-gabbard-asks-biden-sanders-demand-dnc-allow-her-debate-stage/,Breitbart
"The Nissan Motor Company has announced that it will be doubling down on its investments in the United Kingdom, bucking predictions by anti-Brexiteers that the British car industry would crumble after Brexit. As a part of a £1 billion investment scheme at its British factory in Sunderland, Nissan announced that it has already invested £400 million to produce the next generation of its Qashqai compact crossover SUV in post-Brexit Britain. The Japanese auto-giant has installed a gigantic press to stamp out vehicle pannels for the new Qashqai. The press, which was tailor-made to produce the SUV, took 18 months to install and cost an estimated £52 million, according to The Telegraph. The new line of Qashqai SUVs is set to hit the market by 2021 and since a typical run of a model lasts for approximately five years, the 6,000 employees at the Sunderland factory will have relatively good job security until at least 2026. At the unveiling of the new production press, Ashwani Gupta, chief operating officer, said: “Designed, engineered and made in the UK, and more than three million vehicles later, it remains the benchmark, just as our team in the UK continues to set the standard for productivity and quality.” UK Employment Rate Reached Record High as It Leaves the EU https://t.co/BkI8fQPXLC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2020  In February, it was rumoured that Nissan would pull out of Continental Europe to focus on the British market, should Britain and the European Union fail to reach a trade agreement by the end of the year. If the United Kingdom leaves without a trade deal, carmakers such as Volkswagen and Ford would face import tariffs on cars sold in Britain, thereby giving companies with British production facilities, like Nissan, a competitive edge. The plan, according to two insiders at the company, vould enable the company to grow from four per cent of the market share to over twenty. Nissan denied that such a contingency plan exists, however, telling the Financial Times: ”We continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.” The statement by Nissan in February led some to believe that its factory in Sunderland could be in jeopardy in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but with the latest round of investments the company has to date spent over £4 billion at the site, and the factory remains the company’s most efficient outside of Japan.

"New Jersey police arrested 25-year-old Roosevelt Twyne for “illegally” carrying a firearm and possessing so-called “hollow point ammunition.” The Washington Free Beacon spoke to Twyne’s attorney, Evan Nappen, who said Twyne is a security guard with a permit to carry a gun. Nappen said, “He was arrested for the hollow point ammunition. Then they claimed he was transporting his handgun illegally. He had a permit to carry a handgun. The law … makes it clear that it’s illegal to transport unless you are licensed pursuant to chapter 58. And that is precisely what a handgun carry permit is.” He noted that the ammunition in Twyne’s possession, Hornady “Critical Duty” ammunition, was issued by his employer. Moreover, he pointed to the New Jersey State Police website, which shows that such ammo is not considered hollow-point ammunition in the state of New Jersey. The New Jersey State Police website says, “Ammunition lacking a hollow cavity at the tip, such as those with a polymer filling, are not considered to be hollow point ammunition. An example of this can be seen with the Hornady Critical Defense / Critical Duty, Cor-Bon PowRball / Glaser Safety Slug and Nosler Inc. Defense ammunition.” Nappen added, “[The ammo is] lawful. It’s publicly announced as lawful because it is. It’s not hollow. It’s filled.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"AMORIO, Greece (AP) – Over the years, villagers who live near Greece’s border with Turkey got used to seeing small groups of people enter their country illegally. The Greek residents often offered the just-arrived newcomers a bite to eat and directed them to the nearest police or railway station. But the warm welcomes wore off. When Turkey started channelling thousands of people to Greece, insisting that its ancient regional rival and NATO ally receive them as refugees, the Greek government sealed the border and rushed police and military reinforcements to help hold back the flood. Greeks in the border region rallied behind the expanding border force, collecting provisions and offering any possible contribution to what is seen as a national effort to stop a Turkish-spurred incursion. In several cases, authorities asked villagers familiar with the local terrain to help locate migrants who managed to slip through holes cut in a border fence or to cross the River Evros – Meric in Turkish – that demarcates most of the 212-kilometre (132-mile) border. “We were born here, we live here, we work here, we know the crossings better than anyone,” Panayiotis Ageladarakis, a community leader in Amorio, a village that lies some 300 meters (yards) from the river banks. Other villages also responded to the call for volunteer trackers. Small groups of unarmed men monitor known crossing points after dark. Video shows Turkish security forces ordering migrants to cross Greek border at gunpoint, terrifying children https://t.co/ziCZJ4AeGH — Borzou Daragahi 🖊🗒 (@borzou) March 7, 2020  “We sit at the crossings, and they come,” Ageladarakis told The Associated Press as he drove a pickup truck with a fellow Greek border village resident along a rough track at night. “We keep them there most of the time, call police and they come and arrest them. Then, it’s a matter for the police. We aren’t interested in where they take them. We just try to help this effort taking place by the army and the police.” Help for the border units also came from Evros businesses and store owners. Nikos Georgiadis, head of the local restaurant owners’ association, said his colleagues delivered food and water to units stationed at four points on the border. “They also asked us for masks and gloves, and we’ll try to find some,” he said. Ageladarakis said all the migrants he encountered over the past few days were cooperative. “These people are frightened. Nobody has caused any trouble,” he said. But the village community leader said that in his view, the people he encountered did not look like they were fleeing wars in their own countries. “There’s nobody coming from a war,” he said. “None of them are refugees. They’re all illegal migrants and that’s why they’re trying to get into Europe [this way].” Greek authorities said that out of the 252 people arrested for illegal entry over the past week as of Friday, 64 per cent were Afghans, 19 per cent Pakistanis, 5 per cent Turks and 4 per cent Syrians, while the others were from Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Egypt.

"Five teenage boys have been charged in connection with an alleged attack on a teenage girl in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said the five suspects, whose ages range from 14 to 17, turned themselves in to the 77th precinct, according to ABC 7. “All five were charged as minors with robbery and assault. Their fate will be decided in Family Court,” the report stated. Video footage of the incident showed one suspect running toward the 15-year-old girl and kicking her as she lay on the sidewalk. Moments later, several others ran up and also assaulted her. When the group began to disperse, a man reached down and pulled off her tennis shoes, then walked away from the scene holding them as the other suspects followed. Officials said the girl’s cell phone and debit card were also stolen. She was later transported to a hospital with bruising and swelling on her face but is expected to recover. Friday, the NYPD tweeted the video and asked the public for help identifying the suspects: 🚨WANTED for ROBBERY/GANG ASSAULT: On 3/5, at approx 4:10 PM, in front of 216 Utica Ave in Brooklyn, a 15-year-old female was approached by a group of individuals & was punched & kicked to the ground & had her property removed. Any info call or DM @NYPDTips at 800-577-TIPS. pic.twitter.com/JjCCFbnhSJ — NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) March 6, 2020  In a media release Thursday, the department said the recent criminal justice reforms were the “significant reason” New York City has seen a rise in crime this year. The release continued: In the first 58 days of 2020, 482 individuals who had already been arrested for committing a serious (felony) crime such as robbery or burglary were rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Thirty-five percent, or 299, were for arrests in the seven major crime categories – murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto – that is nearly triple the amount of those crimes committed in the same 58 days in 2019. All of [sic] people were arrested for offenses that prior to Jan 1 and bail reform, could have landed them in jail. At a town hall event in February, Mayor Bill de Blasio dismissed Queens residents’ concerns about the growing crime rate and accused them of “whipping up fear.” “There are people and organizations in this city that are trying to tell you New York City is not safe, that are trying to tell you we are declining and we’re going back to the ’70s,” he told them. “Listen, listen if you believe that, God bless you.

"Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) has scheduled a vote for the committee next Wednesday to subpoena former Ukrainian politician Andrii Telizhenko, who may shed insight into Hunter Biden’s potential role in trying to help Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings evade corruption charges. A committee meeting to consider a motion to subpoena Telizhenko is scheduled for March 11 at 2:30 p.m., according to a public posting on the committee’s website. The motion will likely pass, with a majority of Republicans on the committee. Telizhenko was a former Ukrainian diplomat. He worked at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington, DC, between December 2015 and June 2016, as the U.S. presidential campaign was underway, according to the Daily Beast. Telizhenko has claimed that former Ukrainian Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Oksana Shulyar worked with former Democratic National Committee (DNC) consultant Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American, to help the Hillary Clinton campaign investigate then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. He told Politico in a January 2017 article that Shulyar instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort, and Russia. “Oksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,” he said. “They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa.” He added, “Oksana was keeping it all quiet [but] the embassy worked very closely with” Chalupa. Other “sources familiar with the effort” told Politico that Shulyar called Telizhenko into a meeting with Chalupa to provide an update on an American media outlet’s ongoing investigation into Manafort. He said Chalupa told him and Shulyar, “If we can get enough information on Paul [Manafort] or Trump’s involvement with Russia, she can get a hearing in Congress by September [2016].” Chalupa confirmed to Politico that she had discussed the possibility of a congressional investigation with the office of Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, but that it “didn’t go anywhere.” Johnson’s subpoena to Telizhenko, however, is focused on his work as a consultant for Blue Star Strategies, a firm Burisma hired to fight allegations of corruption it was facing. Burisma appointed Hunter Biden to its board in 2014, after his father became the point person in the Obama administration for Ukraine and as the firm’s CEO was facing allegations of corruption and money laundering. Despite having no relevant experience, he was receiving up to $83,000 a month. After Biden’s appointment to the board, Burisma hired Blue Star Strategies to help them fight off the allegations of corruption and to lobby U.S. officials on its behalf. The New York Times reported in May 2019 that Hunter Biden was linked to Burisma’s hiring of Blue Star Strategies. “Among the Americans brought in by Hunter Biden’s American business partners to help fend off the investigations was Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm run by Clinton administration veterans that had done substantial work in Ukraine,” the report said. Biden had links to one of Blue Star Strategies’ co-founders — Sally Painter, a former senior adviser for the Clinton administration. He knew Painter from the Truman National Security Project, an organization for young national security experts on the left. Biden and Painter were both directors of the organization at the same time, according to the Washington Free Beacon. The other co-founder was Karen Tramontano, a former deputy chief of staff to President Clinton. While Painter was working for Burisma, she moderated a panel at a Truman National Security Project event on June 24, 2016. Then-Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken had spoken earlier at that event. Three days later, she contacted Blinken’s then-aide William Russo, to schedule a meeting with Blinken and Tramontano to discuss Ukraine, according to the Daily Caller. Painter wrote to Russo, who currently serves as director of communications for Biden’s presidential campaign, “Per my conversation with Tony at the Truman event, Karen Tramontano and I would like to have a brief coffee with Tony at his earliest convenience regarding some troubling events we are seeing n [sic] Ukraine.” “(He said yes),” she added, referring to Blinken, who currently serves as foreign policy advisor to Biden’s presidential campaign. “We are just back from Kiev.” According to the Times, a team from Blue Star Strategies, including John Buretta, a lawyer who served as a senior official in the Obama Justice Department, had two meetings in Ukraine with its top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, in 2016. Lutsenko replaced Viktor Shokin, whom Joe Biden has stated publicly he pressured Ukraine to fire. Lutsenko had taken a hard line against Burisma, but within 10 months of taking office, Burisma announced he and the Ukrainian courts had “fully closed” all “legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations” against Burisma’s CEO and his companies and that he had been removed by a Ukrainian court from “the wanted list,” according to the Times. Sen. Johnson said in a March 1, 2020, letter to colleagues that he has received U.S. government records indicating that Blue Star Strategies sought to use Hunter Biden’s role as a board member of Burisma to “gain access to, and potentially influence matters at, the State Department.” He said the committee has also requested and received documents from Blue Star Strategies and Telizhenko. However, he said Telizhenko said he cannot turn over all relevant records unless he is compelled by a subpoena, since some of them are subject to a non-disclosure agreement in his employee contract and Blue Star Strategies has been unwilling to turn over the records, according to Johnson’s letter. “Because Mr. Telizhenko’s records and information would be responsive to the Committee’s requests, and Blue Star [Strategies] has refused to produce them, a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko for these records is appropriate at this time,” Johnson wrote. Democrats have blasted the subpoena as an attempt to hurt Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, although Johnson’s efforts were in the works weeks before he announced this week he would seek a subpoena. His committee’s investigation into Burisma has also been going on for nearly a year. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) reportedly was considering voting against the motion, but CNN reported Friday that he would vote to pass the motion — likely ensuring its passage — after receiving assurances from Johnson that the investigation would not become a public spectacle. Johnson also announced this week that he would likely issue an interim report within a month or two focused on what Joe Biden knew about his son Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Senate GOP Investigation into Burisma-Biden Heats Up with Subpoena Planned Next Week,2020-03-07,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/07/senate-gop-investigation-into-burisma-biden-heats-up-with-subpoena-planned-next-week/,Breitbart
"Left-wing actress Bette Midler took her public disdain for President Donald Trump up a notch on Friday, defending “powerhouse” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) from the president’s critiques, calling him the “most hated, most repulsive human male on the planet today.” “#EllizabethWarren is a powerhouse, but Donald Trump, that stable genius, said she was unlikeable,” the Beaches actress said one day after Warren’s announcement. “Well, Don, in breaking news, she’s 100% more likable than you!

They like a person like me that’s not mean.” Despite her defense of Warren, Midler affirmed her support for Mike Bloomberg (D) on Super Tuesday, telling her 1.8 million followers that she was “all in” for the former New York City mayor. “TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, as if you didn’t know. And I am all in for @MikeBloomberg. Rail at me all you want, but I saw New York City go from being down on its knees to standing upright and proud after 9-11,” the Hocus Pocus actress said. “It was a long haul, tough; not without mistakes, but he got it done.” TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, as if you didn't know.

They had men all over the place … [but] this time, they were met by dozens of Texans … who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom.

"Actress and climate activist Jane Fonda has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, calling him the “climate candidate” prior to leading her latest environmental protest in Southern California. During her demonstration, the actress decried oil and gas companies while blaming “a small bunch of white men getting really rich” for causing pollution and health problems for those who live near drilling sites. Jane Fonda led a demonstration Friday in San Pedro and the suburb of Wilmington to protest the fossil fuel industry, demanding that companies put a stop to new drilling activity. The Hollywood star spoke to USA Today before the rally, saying that Sen.

The socialist candidate has already garnered support from stars including Cardi B, Lizzo, Susan Sarandon, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. “There’s a small bunch of white men getting really rich while they’re destroying the health of the people like the people you heard from. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. And guess what: it’s happening all across the country and all across the world,” she said. “We have to say no more fossil fuels.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that his campaign had raised $22 million in five days following a win in South Carolina and a surge of Super Tuesday wins. Biden’s victory in ten out of 14 states that voted on Tuesday put new life into a campaign that was left for dead just weeks before when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was in the lead. The Democrat former vice president told his supporters all of this on a call on Friday in a fundraising update, giving them a warning that the “Bernie Brothers” would be conducting an “increasingly negative” campaign. “What we can’t let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath,” Biden said. “I know I’m going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the Bernie Brothers will run.” “We can’t tear this party apart and reelect Trump,” he added. “We have to keep our eyes on the ball, in my view.” “Bernie Bros” has been the term to describe hardline Sanders supporters since his 2016 election campaign. These “Bernie Bros” have received a lot of pushback for their aggressive tactics on social media, especially on Twitter. Biden and Sanders are set to face off in the next set of primaries on Tuesday, with Idaho, Michigan, Washington, Mississippi, Missouri, and North Dakota all set to vote that day. In one poll taken among Missouri voters, Biden holds a slight edge over Sanders, and another poll taken after Sen.

"The coronavirus outbreak revealed “moral hypocrisy” on the part of global leaders, assessed Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, author of Lust for Love: Rekindling Intimacy and Passion in Your Relationship, describing the West’s decades of dealings with both China and Iran amidst human rights abuses across prior decades as acceptance of the two states’ “moral virus.” Boteach offered his remarks on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with special guest host Joel Pollak. “If you want to look for just how the coronavirus has exposed some of the moral rot of our society, you will notice that when China was imprisoning its own Nobel Peace Prize winner — a political dissident who died in custody and his wife was also imprisoned — when China was just brutalizing citizens for expressing an opinion, we had no issue visiting there,” said Boteach. Boteach added, “[We were] not pushing them to better their human rights record. When Iran was threatening the Jews with a second Holocaust, we had no issues whatsoever in doing the Iran nuclear agreement, and the Europeans were running there to do deals for oil, but when there was a threat to our souls, our morality, our goodness, our ethics, our values, [and] our convictions, nobody gave a damn, but the moment there was a threat to our body … ‘Oh no, I’m not going to go.'” LISTEN:  “It just kind of exposes the moral hypocrisy,” continued Boteach. “We should always have had issues with Iran, not because they have the coronavirus, but because they had a moral virus because they were not ethical people because the mullahs were monsters threatening a genocide.” American foreign policy should be grounded in human rights, Boteach determined.   “We have to be moral people, and our foreign policy should be governed not just by whether or not countries have infectious diseases, but whether they have a human rights that we Americans can respect,” Boteach said. Asked about the religious response to the coronavirus outbreak, Boteach replied, “We have to emphasize life. We have to protect life.

"The coronavirus outbreak demonstrates the need for a healthcare “safety net,” as well as innovation only the private sector can provide, according to  University economics professor Kenneth Rogoff. Rogoff, author of This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, addressed the possible economic impacts of coronavirus in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak. Pollak asked what economic lessons can be learned from the ongoing coronavirus spread. “There is certainly a lesson for having a safety net so that so that if you’re facing a pandemic, you could treat everyone and really have a framework [so] people aren’t afraid to come in and you can treat everyone,” replied Rogoff. Government healthcare policy must be balanced with free-market forces, added Rogoff.  “The whole world depends on the United States for the innovation in drugs and health care, and there’s a very good chance that the vaccine’s going to come from here because we have this very developed private sector, and the question is how to have a system that has both.” LISTEN:
 Government-driven redistributive responses to the coronavirus threat will be favored by those seeking expansion of state power, noted Rogoff. “If you think this would be a good idea anyways, particularly fighting inequality, then you’re not so nervous about trying to increase transfers to people to deal with that,” Rogoff said. “If it turned out the [coronvirus threat] wasn’t so bad, you kind of wanted to make the government bigger [and] you kind of wanted to do these transfers anyway, so you’re willing to err on that direction, but clearly the most effective expenditures you could make are ones that address the problem, [such as] that build up the health sector.” Rogoff proposed some possible government measures to address the coronavirus threat: “Certainly having people get free tests, for example, if they want to, or possibly finding ways to make it easier to call in sick might be a short-term solution [and among the] kinds of things to government can spend money on.” Government policy, Rogoff said, must also seek to “stem the panic,” but should aim beyond financial concerns alone. “[T]he panic is not just about [if] their money [is] in the bank. The panic is much more about people’s health.” Rogoff predicted: “We’re going to end up doing stimulus policies out of this, even in the United States, even with the civil war going on in the political sphere. They’re going to do some kind of significant fiscal stimulus this year to try to mitigate the coronavirus. Call me an optimist, but I’m expecting that.” Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

"Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week,” former Chicago Mayor and former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel sounded off on the 2020 presidential race amid the coronavirus outbreak. Emanuel said the coronavirus precautions preventing President Donald Trump from having his typical rallies and thus missing out on the admiration he craves will be “devastating” and will “psychologically torment him.” “This administration right now looks like they couldn’t organize a one-car parade,” Emanuel stated. “And I think here’s what’s devastating for Donald Trump — beyond the fact that this requires science, management, data and being transparent, which are all his weaknesses — you’re going to have a point that within about two months where you can’t have big events together.” He added, “He is not going to be able to have his rallies, and it is going to psychologically — the office is isolating enough, and his inability to get the admiration, the adulation from that crowds is going to psychologically torment him.

"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) on Sunday voiced his displeasure with the Democrats for the $8.3 billion spending bill to combat the spread of the coronavirus not being out earlier. McCarthy said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the bill, which President Donald Trump signed Friday, was held so Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL) could run ads against Republicans, adding the bill should have been out a week earlier. “We should have had the bill a week earlier,” McCarthy told host Maria Bartiromo. “The Democrats actually held this bill so Congresswoman Bustos, who runs the DCCC, could run ads against Republicans. There should be no politics in this because, as you said, Maria, this is very serious and we should take it for the seriousness that it should be.” He continued, “$8.3 billion, and it does three main things: testing, treatment and telehealth, which is very important because what you want to do is make sure you have containment but make sure these people are able to get the treatment they need, and we were able to make a revision in that where people would use technology today to be able to talk to a doctor, not going out and affecting everybody else around them and make a real difference to this.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",McCarthy Slams Dems for Delaying Coronavirus Bill to Run Ads Against Republicans — ‘We Should Have Had the Bill a Week Earlier’,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/08/mccarthy-slams-dems-for-delaying-coronavirus-bill-to-run-ads-against-republicans-we-should-have-had-the-bill-a-week-earlier/,Breitbart

In reaction to Cruz’s announcement, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) praised his fellow senator’s decision, saying Cruz is “modeling good behavior” by self-quarantining. “He is modeling good behavior saying he will self-quarantine at home and stay away from the public and Congress,” Merkley told Kasie Hunt, host of MSNBC’s “Kasie DC.” Merkley listed off ways to combat the spread of the coronavirus such as bumping elbows instead of shaking hands and frequently cleaning hands. He added, “[W]e’re trying to bring that behavior and convey to people that really this is — think of the flu. If you hand wash a lot, if you cough into your sleeve, if you use fluids on your hands …hand sanitizer, you keep your hands away from your face you greatly reduce the spread, so these are the type of behaviors that all of us in leadership should be modeling. I did a video to convey this and I encourage other folks in elected office to do that.

"A “birth tourism” hotel in Orange County, California, may be shut down by the local city council after years of helping Chinese women deliver their children in the United States for the sole purpose of securing birthright American citizenship. Last week, the planning commission board in Orange County voted to strip the JR Motel of its permit after years of it operating to secure birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of Chinese women with little-to-no ties to the U.S. The Orange County Register reported that birth tourism has “become common in southern California” and that the JR Motel was filled with nurseries and strollers while staff would help Chinese women schedule and travel to doctor’s appointments. The hotel, according to the planning commission, does not take public reservations. Officials with the planning commission said they were not stripping the birth tourism hotel of their permit because the owner is operating a birth tourism business, but because his intentions were not clear when he secured the permit in 2015. As Breitbart News reported in December, a Chinese national was convicted and sentenced to just ten months in prison for operating a birth tourism business that helped secure birthright American citizenship for the children of more than 500 pregnant foreigners, earning $3 million in the process. In January, President Donald Trump’s administration issued a new regulation allowing consular officers who grant B-1 and B-2 visas, temporary business and tourist visas, the ability to deny such visas if they believe a foreign national intends to travel to the country for the primary purpose of delivering a child on U.S. soil and thus securing them birthright citizenship. Every year, as Breitbart News reported, the birth tourism industry delivers about 33,000 U.S.-born children, commonly referred to as “anchor babies,” who secure birthright American citizenship despite their foreign parents having only come to the country on visitor visas. Previous research has put the annual estimate for birth tourism anchor babies at 36,000. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Gosar said neither he nor his staff are exhibiting any symptoms of the illness, which has caused thousands of deaths worldwide after its mysterious outbreak in China’s Wuhan region. “However, in order to prevent any potential transmission, I will remain at my home in Arizona until the conclusion of the 14 day period following my interaction with this individual,” he announced. “Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, I am closing my office in Washington, D.C. for the week,” and his staff will telecommute in the meantime. He further stated on social media that three senior staff members will also self-quarantine. 1.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said in a statement on Sunday that he had been exposed to a CPAC attendee who tested positive for coronavirus. Cruz said that he is currently not experiencing any symptoms of coronavirus and that he plans to stay at home until he has waited a full two weeks since he was exposed to coronavirus at CPAC. He said: Last night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for COVID-19. That interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake. I have consulted with medical authorities from the Houston Health Department, the Harris County Public Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as my personal physician. I have also spoken with Vice President Pence, Leader McConnell, and Mark Meadows. I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy. Given that the interaction was 10 days ago, that the average incubation period is 5-6 days, that the interaction was for less than a minute, and that I have no current symptoms, the medical authorities have advised me that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low. The physicians further advised that testing is not effective before symptoms manifest, and my brief interaction with the individual does not meet the CDC criteria for self-quarantine. The medical authorities explicitly advised me that, given the above criteria, the people who have interacted with me in the 10 days since CPAC should not be concerned about potential transmission. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because of how frequently I interact with my constituents as a part of my job and to give everyone peace of mind, I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, until a full 14 days have passed since the CPAC interaction. Today I released the following statement: pic.twitter.com/XGXEa4ozcg — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) March 8, 2020  Cruz’s statement follows as the American Conservative Union announced on Saturday that one attendee at CPAC had tested positive for Coronavirus. The ACU said that the individual did not interact with President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and “never attended events in the main hall.” Cruz said, “Everyone should continue to treat this outbreak seriously and be driven by facts and medical science.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"Delaware Republican congressional candidate Lee Murphy told Breitbart News Saturday that Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) has achieved nothing in Congress except for obstructing President Donald Trump’s agenda. Murphy, a former Amtrak locomotive engineer, hopes to unseat Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) for the state’s at-large congressional district. Murphy noted that even though the Cook Political Report said that the election gives Rochester a six-point advantage, he can still likely win because the congresswoman has not achieved any victories in Congress. He told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “We’re running against a woman who’s done nothing in three and a half years in office except obstruct the president, and of course, she voted for the president … and she aligns herself with the radical Democrat party in Congress.”  Murphy said that he hopes to channel his blue-collar background to win over the union vote in Delaware. “I’m a blue-collar guy; I worked on a railroad all my life. I was a locomotive engineer for Amtrak,” the Delaware Republican said. Breitbart News Saturday host Boyle noted that the Republican Party is going through a “big political realignment.” He added that earlier on the show, they had on former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who told Boyle why he considers himself a “Trumpocrat.” Murphy said he sees hope in his election chances considering that the state is “more working-class than ever.” Murphy said that gun rights are a “hot issue” in the state, saying that “like Virginia, they’re trying to take our rights away in Delaware.” He added that he sees a “pathway for victory” if there is a “strong Republican turnout” and “dismal turnout” for his Democrat opponent.” Murphy said that Delaware could have a representative who has commonsense values and would actually work with the president to better his state. Republicans need to retake roughly 18 seats to regain the House majority. If Murphy were to unseat his Democrat opponent, it would make it one district easier for Republicans to retake the majority. “Delaware will be in the spotlight and need to take this congressional seat back here to help President Trump take back Congress in 2020. I’m confident in our little state,” he said. Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M Eastern. Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"Five nationals from Chile have been arrested after securing tourist visas to travel to the United States with the intention to allegedly burglarize wealthy residents of California and New York. Chilean nationals Amaro Rosas, Bayron Palta, Fabian Catalan, Juan Rosas, and William Perez were arrested by Nassau County, New York, law enforcement officials after they were tied to a series of burglaries in the wealthy neighborhoods of Sands Point, Locust Valley, Great Neck, and Glen Cove. The Chilean nationals are part of a burglary ring that were able to legally arrive in the U.S. after securing B-2 tourist visas. Nassau County officials said the five men entered on their tourist visas through the U.S.-Mexico border and arrived in southern California before making their way to New York. When they first arrived in the U.S., Nassau County officials said the Chilean nationals burglarized homes in the wealthy Beverly Hills, California, neighborhood — where some of the nation’s wealthiest elite have residences. Then, after burglarizing those homes, Nassau County officials said the five men traveled to New York where they allegedly broke into Long Island homes in four neighborhoods. The Chilean nationals allegedly stole $30,000 worth of watches and $8,000 in cash, according to Nassau County officials. Nassau County officials said the Chilean nationals gave them fake IDs from Argentina and warned that this is the third group of Chileans to be arrested for burglary in Long Island after being allowed to legally enter the U.S. on tourist visas. All five men are being held without bail. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"New York Post journalist Jon Levine was locked out of his Twitter account earlier today and forced to delete several tweets in connection to his article exposing the ultra-wealthy background of socialist YouTuber Carlos Maza. Twitter first locked Levine out of his account this morning, but after inquiries from the journalist and his followers, the platform restored access to his account, claiming that the lockout had been an “error” and that his tweets about Maza did not violate the platform’s policies. However, later in the day, Twitter changed its mind again, telling Levine that “upon further investigation, these tweets violate our Twitter rules, specifically our private information policy.” Levine had tweeted pictures from his recent article, “YouTube socialist Carlos Maza slams the wealthy but lived in luxury,” showing pictures of a $10 million mansion in Florida owned by Maza’s family. The pictures are publicly viewable on real estate websites, where Levine obtained them. Levine’s tweets were archived and can be viewed here. They reveal information about the mega-wealthy background of socialist Maza. Twitter claimed that Levine posting publicly-available images of Maza was a violation of its “private information policy.” Yet Maza has done the same — last month, he called out establishment Democrat James Carville for living in an “obscene four-story mansion,” posting images of the residence to prove it.

Last year, using his position as a writer for far-left Vox.com, Maza pressured YouTube into demonetizing videos from conservative commentator Stephen Crowder, an act that led to the condemnation of the Google-owned platform from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and others. In the aftermath of the controversy, YouTube cracked down on content across its platform. In a tweet about Twitter’s censorship, Levine called the platform’s actions “Orwellian.” SECOND UPDATE: Despite initially calling their decision to lock my account “an error” — Twitter locked me out again a few hours later over the same Carlos Maza story.

"On her Saturday program, Fox News Channel’s Jeanine Pirro used her “Opening Statement” segment to argue the manner in which the media are handling coronavirus was proof of bias and the coverage was meant to damage President Donald Trump. Transcript as follows: PIRRO: If you’ve ever had a question whether the mainstream media distorts, whips up, throws things out of focus or has an agenda, especially when it comes to the Trump administration, look no further than coronavirus. If you listen to the mainstream media, it’s time to buy the family burial plot, visit the cemetery where the dirt is definitely cleaner than your kitchen counter or your bathroom handles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: The coronavirus outbreak has the potential to become a global pandemic. JOY BEHAR, ABC HOST: Don’t listen to Trump. Don’t listen to him. Let’s face it, the President is a reality — LAWRENCE O’DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: The response to the coronavirus in the United States is being led by the most incompetent and ignorant President in history. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: So what’s the downside of their Doomsday reporting? The downside is predictable. When people are scared, when people think it’s just a question of time before they start dropping like flies, they go into survival mode. They don’t spend money. The economy suffers. They don’t invest. The market suffers. They talk about taking their children out of school, education suffers. They talk about canceling March Madness, Coachella, and local businesses suffer. And canceling airlines and cruise ship reservations, the economy suffers. They go into depression mode because their quality of life is over. And who better to trumpet a slowing economy than CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Wall Street is rattled by the worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus.

Where were you when the Dow, the S&P 500, and NASDAQ all repeatedly reached record highs under President Trump? You weren’t interested then, were you? Where were you when the Dow closed at a record high more than 100 times since Donald Trump’s election? Where were you when animal spirits were driving this country to new economic heights? And for your information, our economy can sustain a 3,000-point drop because we are at record highs. Job numbers just came out, and they’re up beyond expectations. The stock market is up for the week. Long-term interest rates are plunging, so people can refinance, and those who need subsidies are going to get them. And the media complains that there was a lackluster initial response by the Trump administration. Say what? Let’s start with the fact that the U.S. has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. And on January 31st, the Trump administration restricted entry into this country from China in an effort to counter the spreading coronavirus outbreak. Even The New York Times noted the administration barred entry by most foreign nationals who had recently visited China. American travelers were under quarantine, as the administration declared a rare public health emergency. The President did this knowing that it would send shocks through the stock market, that it would rattle industry between the world’s two largest economies. He immediately put together the smartest, most sophisticated team of doctors, scientists, and healthcare professionals to deal with his declared coronavirus health emergency. And most important, he assigned to Vice President Mike Pence the job of organizing, monitoring a team to contain, mitigate and treat the problem working with states and local governments. His efforts have been non-stop, keenly focused, and heralded the political criticisms by the left like Governor Inslee of Washington State and Governor Cuomo of New York State are nothing more than political gamesmanship that have no place in this effort. The effort to develop a vaccine making testing kits available to every state lab and available to every doctor in this country with a minimum of $4 million going to each of the 50 states is underway. So, what to do? It’s a virus, like the flu. It actually can be mistaken for the flu, a sore throat, a cough, a fever. And by the way, it is flu season. You say, but people are dying. Sadly, that’s true. And not only are condolences in order, but we owe it to their families and all Americans to come up with a vaccine. Like the flu, tests for coronavirus are now being made available to every state lab. Clinical trials will begin within five weeks for the vaccine. The Federal government is working continuous, vigorously and forcefully to cut the bureaucratic red tape that often slows down vaccine approval. And rest assured the best, the brightest, and the resolute are working non-stop to create this vaccine. Now, they say the mortality rate for coronavirus is higher than a flu. But consider though that we have a flu vaccine, and yet in 2019, sixteen thousand Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have the flu vaccine, the flu would be a pandemic. So all the talk about coronavirus being so much more deadly doesn’t reflect reality. Without a vaccine, the flu would be far more deadly. Now, what we do know is the mortality rate is much higher among elderly adults. According to reports, the risk of dying if infected with the coronavirus is higher the older you are, which might explain why they say children are not really affected by the virus. But in addition to age, as Dr. Anthony Fauci has said, the risk is greater if you, as an elderly person, have an underlying medical condition like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, it is certainly higher if you’re a smoker, which might explain why China has such a high mortality rate. Some studies have estimated that as many as 50 percent of Chinese men are smokers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL MAHER, HBO TALK SHOW HOST: I’m sick of the virus, but not from the virus. People die. That’s what happens in life. The BP oil spill was going to end the world and every other [bleep] we’ve ever had. And it didn’t. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: So, what to do? Wash your hands. I know everyone thinks there’s got to be more to this. The reason you wash your hands is to get the germs off. The reason why you need to get the germs off is because you can then transfer them to your eyes, your nose, your mouth, risking infection to your respiratory system. You’re looking now at a California genius, a medical doctor from their state health department, lecturing how not to touch your face as the woman repeatedly touches the surface then her face and literally puts her fingers in her mouth. Whatever you have to do, don’t touch your face. And gloves won’t matter because the virus can last for hours on them and surfaces. So whether you need to borrow your dog’s shock collar or go out and buy a straightjacket, don’t touch your face. Don’t share drinking glasses, eating utensils, clean all high touch surfaces every day like counters and tabletops and doorknobs and stay at home if you feel sick. And as the Surgeon General said on JUSTICE last week, you don’t need a mask unless you’re sick and there’s no need to go out and clean out the store shelves. As the weather warms, fewer and fewer people will get sick with the virus. Some of the meds need to be left for people who may need them. And if you want to complain about something, complain about the fact that we rely on China and even India for ingredients for some of our medication, even the meds themselves. Like Nuclear Medicine and Moly 99, it is time to have a supply chain for our medicine in the United States. Time to make America first there. So maybe Bill Maher has the right attitude. Stop panicking, fear-mongering, hiding under your bed, and freaking out. In fact — (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP OF MOVIE “MOONSTRUCK”) CHER, PLAYING LORETTA CASTORINI IN MOVIE “MOONSTRUCK”: Snap out of it.

"An immigrant from Egypt has been accused of murdering a 19-year-old girl and her 21-year-old boyfriend in southern Virginia last month, Breitbart News has exclusively learned. Last month, 18-year-old Mohamed Aly was arrested for the alleged murder of 19-year-old Ayanna Maertens-Griffin and 21-year-old Joel Bianda, her boyfriend, WUSA9 reported at the time. The bodies of Maertens-Griffin and Bianda were found by on a highway median in Tuberville, Virginia, next to a silver Nissan Maxima. From the start of the investigation, Virginia State Police believed the couple’s deaths were the result of murder, not a car accident. Ayanna Maertens-Griffin, 19-years-old, and her boyfriend Joel Bianda, 21-years-old, were allegedly murdered by an 18-year-old immigrant from Egypt, Mohamed Aly. (GoFundMe) Days after their bodies were found, Virginia law enforcement officials arrested Aly — who lives in Alexandria, Virginia — on two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of felony use of a firearm. Breitbart News has exclusively learned that Aly first arrived in the U.S. as the child of an American citizen sometime in the early 2000s. A law enforcement official confirmed to Breitbart News that Aly has been a permanent legal resident with a green card since about 2005. In statements to local media, the victims’ families have said they are heartbroken by their loved ones’ deaths. “It’s completely broken all of our hearts,” Maertens-Griffin’s aunt Kassie Rich said. “I don’t even know if we’re going to officially figure out everything, but we hope and pray that we do.” Family and friends have created a GoFundMe page for Maertens-Griffin’s family. More than $12,000 has been raised since February. Likewise, Bianda’s family set up a GoFundMe page, expressing their grief and the fact that the young man was days away from his 22nd birthday. “Joel’s dream was to make it big with his music and to be able to make enough money to take care and move others,” Bianda’s brother wrote on the page. “He loved us with all of his heart. He died at the age of 21, just 16 days after his birthday.

"Florida conservative and third congressional district Republican candidate Judson Sapp told Breitbart News Saturday that he hopes to increase the number of “Trump Republicans” in Congress. Sapp, the CEO of W.J. Sapp Railroad Contractor, hopes to replace the retiring Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL). Sapp has also served on the 2020 Trump Victory Finance Committee. He told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle that he hopes to expand the number of “Trump Republicans in office.” Sapp said, “I was at the Trump Victory on the Finance Committee very early when he relaunched his reelection campaign, and it’s been a privilege. And I think that’s what we see a lot of in Congress. We have a lot of people saying they’re Trump supporters; they say that they support the president. They don’t actually do anything other than lip service. I’m out there on the front lines getting the president reelected. When I get into Congress, I’m going to do the same thing; I would love for the president to start rebranding certain Congress-people ‘Trump Republicans.'”  The Florida Republican said that the some moderate Republicans’ opposition to President Trump’s national emergency on the border inspired him to run for office. Trump’s national emergency declaration granted him the authority to build the wall along America’s southern border. Roughly 13 House Republicans have voted for legislation in February that would terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration and thus make it much harder for the president to secure the border. “One of the things that inspired me to run was the lack of support from congressional members and, of course, senate members,” Sapp said. He added, “When we take back the House, that has to be an issue and it has to be done quickly to support our president.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

"Donald Trump Jr. on Sunday said he wanted to debate former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter over who has used their father’s government position to benefit financially. Trump Jr. challenged Hunter via Twitter and during an interview with Axios, adding that he is willing to release his taxes if the former VP’s son makes his public as well. Citing his interview with Axios on Twitter, President Donald Trump’s eldest son declared: The [mainstream media] loves making a false equivalency between us, so let’s settle it: I challenge Hunter Biden to man up & debate me. Hunter releases his tax returns & I release mine. Let’s have an open [conversation] about who really profited from their father’s public office! The MSM loves making a false equivalency between us, so lets settle it: I challenge Hunter Biden to man up & debate me@JimVandeHei moderates. Hunter releases his tax returns & I release mine. Let's have an open convo about who really profited from their father's public office! pic.twitter.com/6N6MObhGhb — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 8, 2020  “We can go full transparency, we show everything, and we can talk about all of the places where I am supposedly grifting but Hunter Biden isn’t,” Trump Jr. added during his interview with Axios. President Trump’s son stressed that the difference between Hunter and himself is that he made money working for his father as a private businessman while Joe’s son benefited from his father’s taxpayer-funded government position. Trump Jr. told Axios: The difference is I made a lot of money from my father because I worked in his company for 20 years as a private businessman. Hunter Biden got lucrative jobs at MBNA, the biggest bank in the state of Delaware, where daddy happened to be a senator. Where dad also happened to be signing favorable banking legislation that seemed to track where he was getting his raises and his promotions. “Hunter Biden, then about the age of 28 maybe, got on the board of Amtrak,” he continued. “Obviously, he is a locomotive fan,” Trump Jr. quipped. “He knows a lot about these things. No-one believes this. Show me where I’m taking those board seats.” When Axios accused Trump Jr. of benefitting financially during his father’s tenure as president from his book deal and paid speeches, he replied: Nothing that I haven’t done before and again if you look at my tax returns — which maybe we can talk about in this debate — you can see that I haven’t raised and made anymore money than I probably have been for the last few years before we got into politics. So I’d be happy to have that conversation. “I’ve done paid speeches for over a decade,” Trump Jr. also said, later adding, “I don’t even do the international ones anymore.” Asked by Axios if he would release his tax returns, the president’s son, who still runs the Trump Organization with his brother Eric, responded, “If we do it both, 100 percent. Let’s talk about who profited off of whose public service. Happy to do it. Let’s make it happen.” “It is hard to believe anything a Trump says on tax returns when Donald Sr. has lied for years about releasing his,”
TJ Ducklo, the national press secretary for Biden’s presidential campaign, declared in response, according to Axios. Senate Republicans are investigating the Bidens’ activities in Ukraine, particularly Hunter’s business dealings with corrupt Ukrainian energy company Burisma while Joe was serving as vice president. The GOP has pushed back against Democrats’ allegations that they are pursuing the Biden-Burisma probe because White House hopeful Joe has had a resurgence in his quest to become the Democrat party’s presidential nominee.",Donald Trump Jr. Challenges Hunter Biden: ‘Man Up & Debate Me’,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/08/donald-trump-jr-challenges-hunter-biden-man-up-debate-me/,Breitbart
"The Michigan Education Association (MEA) revved up its attacks on President Donald Trump in advance of Tuesday’s presidential primary that pits former Vice President Joe Biden against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on the Democrat side, while the president is essentially unopposed on the Republican side. Last of @MEAOnline “Top Five” Reasons to Vote Tuesday against DeVos/Trump ed agenda – vouchers and for-profit charters. @PaulaMEAPres in the @freep: If Trump and DeVos do this, our public schools will suffer—even more. #Election2020 #FireDeVos #MichEdhttps://t.co/KqVeCjx5pm — MEA Online (@MEAOnline) March 6, 2020  The brazenly partisan political attacks on President Trump by the Michigan teachers’ union is yet further evidence that the #RedforEd movement’s goal is, as Breitbart News first reported in February 2019, to defeat President Trump in 2020: A well-funded and subversive leftist movement of teachers in the United States threatens to tilt the political balance nationwide in the direction of Democrats across the country as Republicans barely hang on in key states that they need to hold for President Donald Trump to win re-election and for Republicans to have a shot at retaking the House and holding onto their Senate majority. This teachers union effort, called #RedforEd, has its roots in the very same socialism that President Trump vowed in his 2019 State of the Union address to stop, and it began in its current form in early 2018 in a far-flung corner of the country before spreading nationally. Its stated goals–higher teacher pay and better education conditions–are overshadowed by a more malevolent political agenda: a leftist Democrat uprising designed to flip purple or red states to blue, using the might of a significant part of the education system as its lever.89 In 2020, 56 million students attend K-12 schools in the United States, according to the Center for Education Reform. Of those, 50.8 million attend public schools, and 3.2 million attend public charter schools. Of the 6.4 million K-12 students who do not attend public schools, 4.8 million attend private schools and 1.6 million are home schooled. In a February op-ed, MEA president Paula Herbart wrote: In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump proposed diverting precious resources from our public schools to failed voucher schemes that drive taxpayer dollars to private schools and wealthy special interests. It’s only the latest gimmick by Trump and anti-public education Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to disinvest in our public schools and the future of our kids. With Devos’ full support, for-profit charter schools continue raking in cash on the backs of our kids and taxpayers. This is nothing short of highway robbery as Michigan’s dedicated public educators continue doing more with less to help all students succeed. Herbart’s attack on charter schools represents the accepted view among most union officials, Democrat candidates, and members of the educational establishment. Both Biden and Sanders oppose vouchers. They also both oppose the expansion of for-profit charter schools. Biden has said he wants to end their expansion, Sanders has called for an end to for-profit charter schools entirely. As the New York Times reported, “for-profit charter schools . . . account for a small proportion of existing charters.” But conservatives point to evidence that charter schools perform well, as Connan Houser noted in this commentary at the Hill in 2017: Two studies were released this month from universities in California that demonstrate the effectiveness of school choice and the need for more options in education. In early October, the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) at Stanford University released a study which followed the educational progress of over 97,000 charter school students in New York over the course of four years. The research concluded that charter school students perform at a level equivalent to receiving an additional 22 days of learning in reading and 63 days in math per year when compared with their public-school counterparts. The results for students attending schools associated with a Charter Management Organization were even greater, adding up to approximately 57 additional days in reading and 103 in math. Charter school minority students, who accounted for 92 percent of the study’s population, tested at a level equal to receiving at least 23 extra days of learning in reading, and 57 days in math when compared to traditional public-school minority students. CREDO was clearly justified in concluding that, for minority students, attending charter schools “indicated a significant academic advantage.” However, this was not the study’s most significant finding. Last week, in the Wall Street Journal, Conor P. Williams, a researcher from the progressive Century Foundation defended charter schools: U.S. charter schools enroll a greater proportion of students of color than traditional public schools and a similar proportion of English-language learners. . . A better debate around charter schools would focus on how well they serve their students. In a Democratic debate last fall, Julián Castro claimed charters perform no better than district schools. One hears this often and it has some empirical grounding, in particular a 2013 Stanford study, which found that students nationwide learn at relatively similar rates in charters and district schools. But charter schools are particularly effective with some historically underserved groups. The Stanford study found they foster greater learning than district schools for English-language learners as well as African-American and Hispanic students living in poverty. And charter-school performance varied widely by state. Charters in Massachusetts performed much better than the state’s traditional public schools, while charters in Nevada performed much worse. The MEA’s attacks on Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary masks the ongoing struggle within the #RedforEd movement. The activist #RedforEd leaders in most states are strongly supportive of Bernie Sanders, as was the case in Minnesota, where one of the heads of the St. Paul Federation of Teachers that recently authorized a strike vote spoke at an election eve Sanders rally, and another serves on the board of an activist group that endorsed Sanders in January. State leaders of teachers unions have been united in their attacks on Trump, but more circumspect when it comes to the choice for the Democratic nomination between Sanders and Biden. In Michigan, the MEA’s Herbart has unabashedly attacked President Trump, as she did in this retweet: Why defeating Trump this fall is absolutely essential—but, alas, not sufficient. It’s going to take enormous work to build/rebuild democracy in the US and around the world. https://t.co/4QiqShGyuH — Sam Bagenstos (@sbagen) March 5, 2020  On the choice between Sanders and Biden, Herbart has been more subtle, as she was in this recent retweet of Sen.

I will do everything in my power to help elect him the next President of the United States. pic.twitter.com/DbB2fGWpaa — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) March 8, 2020  Herbart also retweeted this March 4 tweet from Joe Thomas, head of the Arizona Education Association: When you openly doubt a losing candidate’s supporters will vote for the eventual nominee you are reinforcing that possibility.

Reinforce it until everyone internalizes it as the only option. #2020election — Joe Thomas (@AZ1Thomas) March 4, 2020  One week after Tuesday’s primary in Michigan, attention will turn to primaries in four large states where the #RedforEd movement has been very active since it burst onto the scene two years ago: Arizona, where the #RedforEd movement was launched in March 2018, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio.",Michigan Teachers Union Revs Up #RedforEd Attacks on President Trump Ahead of Primary,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/08/michigan-teachers-union-revs-up-redfored-attacks-president-trump-ahead-primary/,Breitbart
"Representative Jackie Speier (D-CA) complained Sunday on MSNBC that President Donald Trump was putting “his most ardent supporters at risk” by not canceling his upcoming political rallies in light of the current coronavirus outbreak. Speier said, “I don’t think the president is capable of telling us the truth about the coronavirus. And I regret saying that. I think we have to rely on the scientists who are attempting to tell the truth even when they have to contradict the president. ” She added, “The fact that he is not willing to cancel his various rallies suggests that he is willing to place even his most ardent supporters at risk because we’re supposed to stay six feet away from other persons in order to mitigate the exchange of those viruses. I think that he is showing, unfortunately, why he is so ill-prepared to guide our country during this time of the crisis.” Speaking to reporters on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he had no plans to cancel his campaign rallies over concerns about the coronavirus.

"LONDON (AP) – As cases of the coronavirus surge in Italy, Iran, South Korea, the U.S. and elsewhere, many scientists say it’s plain that the world is in the grips of a pandemic — a serious global outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far resisted describing the crisis as such, saying the word “pandemic” might spook the world further and lead some countries to lose hope of containing the virus. “Unless we´re convinced it’s uncontrollable, why [would] we call it a pandemic?” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week. The U.N. health agency has previously described a pandemic as a situation in which a new virus is causing “sustained community-level outbreaks” in at least two world regions. Many experts say that threshold has long been met: The virus that was first identified in China is now spreading freely in four regions, it has reached every continent but Antarctica, and its advance seems unavoidable. The disease has managed to gain a foothold and multiply quickly even in countries with relatively strong public health systems. On Friday, the virus hit a new milestone, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide, far more than those sickened by SARS, MERS or Ebola in recent years.   “I think it’s pretty clear we’re in a pandemic and I don’t know why WHO is resisting that,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Experts acknowledge that declaring a pandemic is politically fraught because it can rattle markets, lead to more drastic travel and trade restrictions and stigmatize people coming from affected regions. WHO was previously criticized for labelling the 2009 swine flu outbreak a pandemic. But experts said calling this crisis a pandemic could also spur countries to prepare for the virus’s eventual arrival. WHO already declared the virus a “global health emergency’ in late January, putting countries and humanitarian organizations on notice and issuing a broad set of recommendations to curb its spread. Even in countries that moved quickly to shut down their links to China, COVID-19 has managed to sneak in. Within a matter of weeks, officials in Italy, Iran and South Korea went from reporting single new cases to hundreds. “We were the first country to stop flights to China and we were completely surprised by this disease,” said Massimo Galli, an infectious-diseases professor at the University of Milan. “It’s dangerous for the entire world that the virus is able to spread underground like this.” With more than 3,800 cases, Italy is the epicentre of Europe’s outbreak and has shut down schools, closed sports stadiums to fans and urged the elderly not to go outside unless absolutely necessary. But it has still exported cases of the virus to at least 10 countries, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Spain, South Africa and Nigeria. Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh who co-chaired a review of WHO’s response to the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, said a pandemic declaration is long overdue. “This outbreak meets all the definitions for a pandemic that we had pre-coronavirus,” she said. At a news conference last month, Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said a pandemic is “a unique situation in which we believe that all citizens on the planet” will likely be exposed to a virus “within a defined period of time.” Several experts said they hadn’t heard that definition. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for its part, defines a pandemic as “an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute´s Department of Science Education.

I will do everything in my power to help elect him the next president of the United States.” An MSNBC producer asked, “Do you think he’ll make another exuberant decision in possibly tapping you as his vice President?” Harris said, “Listen, let me tell you something.

"Fox News’ Howard Kurtz criticized his colleagues for their commentary about Joe Biden’s mental faculties on Sunday’s broadcast of “MediaBuzz.” Kurtz said, “I always criticize liberal commentators for saying things like ‘President Trump is mentally ill’ and ‘President Trump has psychosis, and he’s narcissistic and all that,’ so I do think it was unfortunate that some commentators on Super Tuesday — Brit Hume, Marc Thiessen, people I respect — said Joe Biden is senile or getting there. Certainly, he’s forgetful with his memory lapses, and you can question his performance.” On Super Tuesday, after Biden won the majority of delegates, Brit Hume asked, “How many of the people who voted for him tonight would agree that he’s senile? Or getting there?” Marc Thiessen said, “The reason why Biden is surging is because there is no credible alternatives. It reminds me a lot about Mitt Romney in 2012 when the Republicans were casting around for anybody but Romney because they knew he was weak, they didn’t think he could go against Obama. If he couldn’t defend himself against Newt Gingrich’s attacks on his Bain Capital experience, how was he going to withstand the Obama attacks? There was no other alternative.

"President Donald Trump has decided to skip the annual Congressional St. Patrick’s Day lunch on Capitol Hill, according to Politico‘s Playbook. “Since the Speaker [of the House Nancy Pelosi] has chosen to tear this Nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the President will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity, and will instead celebrate the rich history and strong ties between the United States and Ireland at the White House on March 12,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement. The annual lunch on Capitol Hill takes place around St. Patrick’s Day in addition to a White House meeting with the Prime Minister of Ireland and a White House reception where the Taoiseach traditionally gives the president a bowl of shamrocks. The Congressional luncheon is an ongoing tradition started by House Speaker Tip O’Neill in 1983, who invited President Ronald Reagan to Capitol Hill for the occasion. But the relationship between Trump and Pelosi has deteriorated, particularly after she ripped up the president’s speech at his 2020 State of the Union address. She also removed the words “high privilege” and “distinct honor” for the traditional introduction of the president at Congress at the beginning of his speech.

In early February, the CEO of CEPI, Richard Hatchett, said the group hoped to start clinical testing for a new vaccine in just 16 weeks. “It is increasingly clear that containment measures for COVID-19 can only slow down its spread and the virus is now entering a stage of unprecedented threat in terms of its global impact,” Hatchett said. “It is critical that we … invest in the development of a vaccine that will prevent people from getting sick,” he said. Mr. Hatchett said that the development of a workable vaccine could cost upwards of $2 billion. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are more than 20 potential vaccines in development. The profits for pharmaceutical companies who successfully produce a vaccine could be enormous, The Times noted, as the French drugmaker Sanofi, one of the world’s foremost producers of vaccines, made $2.5 billion selling flu vaccines last year.

Stelter said, “Trump is doing things that undermine the response. He’s continuing to contradict health experts by saying anybody can get a test, which is not true right now. Not true. His behavior at the CDC on Friday spoke volumes about his mindset. He wore a campaign hat to the event. He asked about Fox’s ratings. He insulted the Democratic governor of Washington state and brought up the Ukraine scandal. Most of the news coverage of this visit downplayed just how strange it was. That is a problem. We have to describe reality as it actually is. Not shy away from the abhorrent responses we’re seeing from the commander in chief. Some of his aides are saying this is contained. That’s a lie. Thankfully there’s been fact checks on that point.” He added, “What we need do is prioritize accurate information from experts over misinformation from politicians. Trump and the news media have a tendency to make everything about Trump. But this virus story is only a little bit about Trump. Should he be doing things differently? Yes. For example, the CDC says older Americans should limit travel, but he’s’s not amplifying that message. He should be. Right now. He can tweet about it right now.

Robinson told them: [Law-abiding citizens] want to be able to go the gun show and buy a hunting rifle or a sport rifle. They aren’t military grade weapons sold at a gun show. An AR-15 is not a military grade weapon. Anybody that would go into combat with an AR-15 is full, it’s a semi-automatic .22 rifle. You’d be killed in 15 minutes in combat with that thing. Fox News reports that Robinson won the Republican nomination Tuesday to run for Lt. Governor. Robinson plans to defend the Second Amendment, but he stresses there are other important issues, too. “Our message is so much more than the Second Amendment, which is a crucial issue. It’s a message that touches on all the topics conservative North Carolinians are concerned with today,” Robinson said.

"Beginning March 16, 2020, teachers in Texas’ Santa Fe Independent School District will be able to carry guns on their persons as part of the state’s Guardian Plan. An attacker struck Santa Fe High School on May 18, 2018, killing 10 innocents and wounding numerous others. The Texas Tribune spoke to Flo Rice, a former substitute teacher who was wounded in the attack, and she welcomed the news that teachers will be armed under the Guardian Plan. And she made clear she wishes they had been armed on the morning on the attack, saying, “I understand the other side that does not want more guns in the schools, but I just know from my personal experience and what happened to me, [the Guardian Plan] could have made a difference in the outcome.” Rusty Norman, Santa Fe ISD school board president, addressed the decision to adopt the Guardian Plan, saying: This is not some knee-jerk reaction, this is not something we are taking lightly. We have a school and we have a community that suffered a mass tragedy, and we’ve had to respond accordingly, with things that others may or may not choose to do. The district had the choice of one of two programs–the school marshal program and the Guardian Plan. A key difference between the two is that the marshal plan requires teachers to keep their guns in a locked box, whereas the Guardian Plan allows teachers to carry a gun on persons, at the ready, throughout the day. School board president Norman observed: This is just another layer as a last line of defense, if something gets past all of those other layers and becomes an issue in a classroom or hallway or in one of the school facilities, that someone may be there that could protect themselves along with all the students and staff that are around them. On March 8, 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis signed legislation allowing Florida’s teachers to be armed for classroom defense. That move was the result of the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting, and the legislation DeSantis signed was promoted by Andrew Pollack, father of Parkland shooting victim Meadow Pollack.

"Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) said on Sunday’s broadcast of CBS’s “Face the Nation” that officials had “no concept” of the true scope of the coronavirus outbreak because the Trump administration “didn’t see this coming.” Partial transcript as follows: BRENNAN: We’re back now with Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who is on the Senate committee that oversees healthcare. Connecticut is one of the 33 states with confirmed cases of coronavirus. Senator, it’s good to have you here this morning. And I’m sorry to hear about what’s happening in my home state of Connecticut. How many cases do you think there are right now? There are two that have been reported. MURPHY: Oh, listen, I imagine we have hundreds, if not thousands of cases in my state. I think we have no concept of the scope of this epidemic yet because we have not been able to test. And the fact of the matter is we can’t make good judgments about the measures we should be taking in Seattle or in Danbury or Hartford unless we are able to do these tests. And what is unforgivable is that the administration didn’t see this coming and didn’t put the resources in early to make sure that everybody had these tests available. But we are likely going to have to take much stronger measures as time goes on. But nobody understands where the epidemic is the worst until we get tests widely deployed. BRENNAN: Now, the administration says there are tests in the pipeline. They said about a million were sent out for delivery, arrival on Friday. Are you seeing that in Connecticut? MURPHY: We are not seeing that in Connecticut. We now have private lab capacity to do tests. But our understanding is that we are nowhere near that number that was proffered by the administration last year of a million. We are doing a lot more screening in our state, but we do not have the ability to give a test to everyone who wants one, as the president said was the case on Friday afternoon. And that is incredibly concerning given the fact that we saw this epidemic coming. We could have made a decision back in January or February to accept the WHO test that was available to us or start putting serious resources into developing our own test. The administration did neither and they did neither, because this president has created a culture of misinformation in which no one wants to give him bad news. And that created a disincentive in the White House and in the administration to come up with an early test.

"Former Rep. Donna Edwards (D- MD) called on President Donald Trump to “shut up” about the coronavirus outbreak. Host Chris Wallace asked, “How legitimate do you think it is for Democrats to go after the president on the administration response to the coronavirus?” Edwards said, “I think it’s legitimate to challenge the process and the management of this crisis. It is a public health crisis. I think whenever we hear Dr. Fauci and other experts to talk about this virus and about what to do, and what Americans can do, that it actually is a somewhat reassuring. ” She continued, “What we don’t get is that kind of reassurance coming directly from the president, because of his contradictions, because, you know, the information that he puts out is just not accurate. He would actually, I think, do better in terms of the public if he’d just shut up. Because I don’t think people wouldn’t necessarily blame the president for something that was out of his control, but if he continues in his administration mismanages the crisis, then I think it’s a legitimate point of challenge by anyone who wants to be president saying I would manage it better.” She added, “For example, that Hurricane Katrina and the response had with President Bush. I don’t think this is different in that respect.

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nominee, said Sunday on CNN that she “begrudgingly” gives Breitbart News “a lot of credit” for its ability to shape a narrative. Host Fareed Zakaria said, “There was an article in Vox, and I don’t know if you saw it, on Super Tuesday, on Facebook, the single most searched article —the single searched news topic was Hillary Clinton’s e-mails.” Clinton said, “I’ll tell you what I make of it, is that Fox and the sort of right-wing echo chamber has mastered Facebook, aided and abetted, might I say, by Facebook. So I read that article and what that said to me was here it’s Super Tuesday, the Democrats are trying to decide who they want to nominate against Donald Trump, the Coronavirus is spreading, we now have more and more reports from different places in the country, but led by Fox News and Breitbart and others, it’s going to be about my e-mails. A totally, you know, bogus, finished, nonsense attack on me because they know how not only to drive those stories under the radar screen where the mainstream press like yourself are covering. You know, what’s happening now, but they know how to deliver those stories through the algorithms into the feeds of millions and millions of people.” She added. “So I begrudgingly give them a lot of credit because they are shaping a narrative that is part of the messaging around Trump’s re-election, around people who challenge Trump, changing the subject all of the time.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Hillary Clinton: I ‘Begrudgingly’ Give Breitbart News ‘A Lot of Credit’ for Leading the Narrative,2020-03-08,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/08/hillary-clinton-i-begrudgingly-give-breitbart-news-a-lot-of-credit-for-leading-the-narrative/,Breitbart
"Former Vice President Joe Biden is facing backlash over his decades-long support for the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as he campaigns across Michigan ahead of the state’s Democrat primary. Biden, who often touts his support from organized labor on the campaign trail, was met by protesters on Monday at rally in Detroit. As the former vice president was speaking, a number of individuals unfurled two giant banners, one of which read ‘NAFTA killed our jobs.’ The individuals, some of whom identified as union members, began chanting “Biden killed jobs,” forcing the former vice president to pause and address the disruption. “That’s alright, let them go,” Biden said, as supporters and security attempted to pressure the protesters to stand down. “Let them go, this is not a Trump rally. The ‘Bernie Bros’ are here, let them go.” When the crowd subsided and the protesters were escorted out, Biden used the opportunity to take a shot at both President Donald Trump and his rival for the Democrat nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “I’m not worried about it, it’s just a reflection of what’s wrong with American politics today,” the former vice president said. “This is one of the things that Donald Trump has generated, this is not who we are … as a party … or as a people. We have a lot of crazy folks around.” The altercation in Detroit comes as Biden’s long-standing support for free trade takes center stage as the primary contest heads into Michigan. Sanders, who is hoping that a win in the state can restart his flailing presidential campaign, is hammering hard on the issue. In tv ads and on the stump, the Vermont septuagenerian has lambasted Biden for his support of NAFTA and the other free trade agreements, claiming that if Democrats were to nominate someone with such a record, it would essentially mean surrendering the industrial Midwest to Republicans. “Does anybody think that Joe can go to Michigan or Wisconsin or Indiana or Minnesota and say, ‘Vote for me. I voted for those terrible trade deals,” Sanders said during a recent rally. The strategy is one that has worked in the past for the senator. During his 2016 bid for the Democrat presidential nomination, Sanders was able to score upset victories over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by emphasizing his opposition to free trade, specifically then-President Barack Obama’s Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Sanders’ message was particularly potent in Michigan, where the burden of free trade has been most pronounced. Since NAFTA was first implemented in 1994, Michigan lost more than 168,000 manufacturing jobs to countries overseas, most notably Mexico. The impact was felt most heavily by white working-class voters, many of whom lack a college degree. In 2016, such voters overwhelmingly backed Sanders in Michigan’s Democrat primary, handing the senator a narrow victory over Clinton. The results were surprising, not only because Sanders was coming off devastating losses in South Carolina and Super Tuesday, but also because most polls heading into the contest had shown the former secretary of state winning heavily. Sanders ‘victory in Michigan, along with further wins in Wisconsin and Minnesota, foreshadowed the difficulty Clinton would have in keeping such states in the Democrat column in November 2016. Biden, for his part, seems to understand that history and the detriment posed by his support for free trade. Even before the 2020 Democratic field winnowed to a head-to-head matchup with Sanders, the former vice president had already begun distancing himself from his prior stance on the topic. During a Democrat presidential debate in July 2019, Biden admitted that he would not rejoin TPP if elected president. The move was surprising given that the former vice president had once touted the deal’s ability to forge a “new world order” where open markets would force even countries such as China to reform and prosper. Biden built from that reversal at a another debate in August, when he further promised to oppose a “new NAFTA” agreement after being badgered on the issue by rivals. Monday’s protests in Detroit, though, indicate that Biden’s prior championing of free trade is unlikely to be forgotten, especially by supporters of Sanders. Complicating matters for the former vice president is that Trump, himself, appears poised to continue hammering away on the issue if Biden were to become the Democrat nominee. “Joe Biden made a deal, NAFTA,” the president said last week during a campaign rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “He approved it, he was pushing it. It’s the worst trade deal ever made.",Joe Biden Faces Backlash Over NAFTA Support Ahead of Michigan Primary,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/joe-biden-faces-backlash-over-nafta-support-ahead-of-michigan-primary/,Breitbart
"The lawyers representing the mother of a child fathered by Hunter Biden recently filed a motion seeking to have the former vice president’s son held in contempt of court for repeatedly refusing to obey a paternity and child support suit-linked order to provide financial documents, including his 2017 and 2018 personal tax returns. Citing the contempt motion filed in an Arkansas court by 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts’ lawyers on Friday, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette revealed that besides his tax returns, Hunter Biden has also failed to disclose: “All financial institutions used by him or a business he owns or controls;” “a list of all companies he currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated;” “a list of all sources of income for the past five years;” “a list of all employers for the past five years;” tax documents for companies he owns and “a copy of deeds to properties that he owns or in which he has an ownership interest.” “[T]he defendant continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support,” the motion declared, adding, “This Court should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law.” Roberts is a former stripper and the mother of 50-year-old Hunter’s child. Hunter’s conduct is “willful and contemptuous,” Roberts’ lawyers also argued, urging the court to order him to appear in person at a March 13 pretrial hearing to explain why the tribunal should not hold him in contempt, Fox News reported on Sunday. The Arkansas court expects Hunter to appear for a deposition on Wednesday in Little Rock despite his attorney arguing that his client would be unavailable until April 1. Hunter must appear for a deposition before the March 13 hearing, the judge insisted. “After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents could shed light on his father’s massive conflicts of interest as vice president,” Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee (RNC), told Fox News on Sunday. Citing the results of a DNA test, the Arkansas judge hearing the paternity and child support case ruled in January that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, is the “biological and legal father” of Roberts’ child. According to documents filed in connection to Roberts’ suit, Hunter is the subject of multiple criminal investigations, including a money-laundering probe linked to Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. Hunter served on Burisma’s board of directors for a lucrative $83,000 a month while his father was in charge of U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president, prompting corruption allegations that have triggered investigations by Senate Republicans. The former VP’s son worked for Burisma between 2014 and 2019 despite the conflict of interest and corruption concerns raised by individuals from inside and outside the Obama administration. Hunter has repeatedly defied multiple court orders, refusing to comply with deadlines to provide the financial information. Roberts’ lawyers have reportedly filed three motions to hold Hunter in contempt of the Arkansas court — on March 6, December 23, and January 20. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported on Saturday: In Friday’s Renewed Motion for Contempt and for Order to Show Cause, Roberts’ attorney, Clint Lancaster, said [Hunter] “has continued to flaunt the orders of this Court by failing to answer discovery, comply with court orders, and provide his financial information.” Circuit Judge Don McSpadden, who was initially assigned the case, made clear more than three months ago that Hunter could not withhold certain records. Circuit Judge Holly Meyer replaced McSpadden in January. “He needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire,” Meyer declared during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, the Democrat-Gazette reported. According to the New York Times, Hunter is spending time pursuing a career in art in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in the Hollywood Hills. He is reportedly driving a Porsche. Donald Trump Jr. challenged Hunter over the weekend to a debate, adding that he would release his tax returns if the former vice president’s son makes his public as well.",Contempt Motion by Mother of Hunter Biden’s Child: He ‘Willfully’ Defied Court Order to Provide Documents,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/contempt-motion-hunter-biden-willfully-defied-court-order/,Breitbart
"During an interview aired on Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden stated President Trump has “no competence” on handling the coronavirus and that the market is falling because people don’t trust what the president says. Biden stated, “[T]his gets down to competence and capability. And the — unfortunately, the president has very — no competence in how to handle this crisis.

I mean, there’s no sense of urgency.” Host Lawrence O’Donnell asked, “Do you think the market reaction is a reaction to the markets realizing the president simply does not tell them or the world or this country the truth about this situation, and a market needs clear information?” Biden responded, “I believe that’s the case.

"During a town hall on the Fox News Channel on Monday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said that he doesn’t regret his comments about Fidel Castro and stated that China has reduced extreme poverty, but saying that doesn’t mean he approves of China’s government. Moderator Bret Baier asked, “Do you regret at all saying what you said, at that time, in this race?” Sanders responded, “No. Look, I have spent my entire life fighting for working people and fighting for democracy. And, Bret, if you check my record, I have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is in the Soviet Union, whether it’s in Cuba, whether it is in Saudi Arabia. … Whether it’s the United Arab Emirates, wherever it may be. I happen to be old-fashioned, and I believe in democracy. So, if you look at a country like China, for example, today, is China a democracy? Of course it’s not a democracy. It is an authoritarian country. And Xi is taking it in a bad direction. But what can we say about China in the last 50 years? Would anybody in their right mind deny that extreme poverty in China has been reduced? Can anyone deny that? Of course not. Does that mean we approve of the Chinese government? No, it doesn’t.” He continued, “But I think, sometimes — and I know it’s hard given — not you — given the media that we deal with and everything else, you say something, and people can beat up on you. I think you’ve got to tell the truth. So, if, in China, they have reduced extreme poverty, does that make me a communist who supports China?

"Scott Presler, the man who launched the clean up American cities movement last summer after President Donald Trump spotlighted the blight in Democrat-controlled Baltimore, continued his work over the weekend helping tornado victims in Tennessee. But he also told Breitbart News that in cities across the country, it is illegal immigrants getting benefits while homeless Americans are living on the streets. Presler told Breitbart News that he felt compelled to use his large network of volunteers to lend a hand in the cleanup effort in Tennessee following a tornado that devastated parts of the state and killed at least 25 people. “We had over 100 volunteers. The majority were from Nashville, but some even came from Knoxville, Tennessee. One drove ten hours from Dallas in her car, and some even came from Atlanta, Georgia,” Presler told Breitbart News. “We filled half of a truck full of items that we donated to a Baptist church including things like water or non-perishable food hygiene products, baby wipes,” Presler said. “And then after we were done donating the items, we sent out teams of volunteers to help clean up debris.” The real heroes, in addition to the volunteers, were Jami & her amazing team,  who donated 100 meals!  Make sure to follow @TNCobblerCo & support these good-hearted people. #NashvilleStrong pic.twitter.com/ztiAm20K1i — #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) March 9, 2020  But what has struck Presler over the course of his mission is how illegal immigrants are being prioritized in U.S. cities while Americans are living on the streets. Presler spoke about this issue recently at the 2020 CPAC convention in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Besides picking up trash, your heart is drawn to homeless people,” Breitbart News said in the interview. “And you don’t just pick up trash around them, but you like to engage with them. Why do you want to do that?” “I want to give them hope,” Presler said. “These are cities that I’m going to that have been neglected for decades where these people truly are hopeless.” “And so I want to go in there as just a shot of energy — a shot of this ‘can do’ attitude and ‘can do’ spirit,” Presler said. He said he met a young man living on the streets of San Francisco who had a daughter and a job, ironically, picking up trash, but lived in a tent on the streets. Presler asked him how he felt about illegal immigrants getting benefits. “And he said, ‘I’m angry.’ He said, ‘What about us? We should have priority. We were here first.’” “So, in dealing with the homeless community, especially, I’m not only really careful to respect their humanity because they are — they’re human beings,” Presler said, “but I want to change the stigma because so many people think the homeless community are lazy, which is wrong.” Presler said he met a man in Los Angeles who worked in the movie business but still lived on the streets. “These are people that either they [face] hard times or they can’t afford housing, but these are smart, intellectual people, and I just think it’s wrong that illegal immigrants come first but we don’t take care of our people,” Presler said. Presler plans more cleanups on March 14 in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia on April 4. His crew will visit Detroit on May 2, and he also hopes to host a cleanup during the Democrat nominating conference in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

"Lenard “Charlamagne tha God” McKelvey criticized former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday for not appearing on The Breakfast Club radio broadcast. McKelvey told MSNBC’s Craig Melvin that the Democrat frontrunner owes his “political life” to black supporters and that his campaign “would be dead” without them. And while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg have all appeared to speak to black voters through his nationally syndicated radio show, Biden has been conspicuously absent. Asked why he thinks that might be, McKelvey was stumped: “I have no idea,” he answered. “It goes back to what I said: Joe Biden owes black people his political life. You know what I’m saying? So don’t disrespect that base by not showing up, especially when, you know, all your other former opponents did,” he said. McKelvey also claimed that sources have told him that the decision may have something to do with Biden’s campaign advisers. “I definitely got it on great authority that a lot of the black surrogates around him don’t want him to come on ‘The Breakfast Club’ for whatever reason,” he said. “Black people saved his life the past couple of weeks,” McKelvey concluded. “His campaign would be dead if it wasn’t for our O.G. Jim Clyburn in South Carolina endorsing him, and all those black voters in the South going out and voting for him,” McKelvey concluded. “Plus, you were the vice president for the first black president.

"A convicted felon who became one of the faces of the “First Step Act” law after his release from prison last year has since been re-arrested for allegedly trafficking meth in North Carolina. Troy Powell stood behind President Donald Trump at last year’s White House ceremony celebrating the passage of the First Step Act, which has released at least 3,100 convicted felons from federal prison including at least 59 convicted killers and assailants, 239 convicted sex offenders, 960 inmates with drug convictions, 106 convicted robbers, 496 inmates with weapons and explosives convictions. At the ceremony, Powell thanked Republican and Democrat lawmakers for their passage of the law, suggesting that there be a “second step” that releases more federal inmates. Powell had been serving a 20-year federal sentence for a 2004 drug offense. “I’d like to say thank you to everybody here on Capitol Hill for finally getting this bill pushed through … there’s more that can be done. I left so many people behind in prison doing 40 and 50 years for nothing. I mean absolutely nothing,” Powell said. “I think there should be a second step.” About a year after his release, Powell has been arrested for his alleged part in a meth trafficking ring in Caldwell County, North Carolina, as WSOCTV.com reported. Powell was charged with possession of meth, intent to sell meth, and conspiracy after police said he and three other men were in possession of thousands of dollars worth of meth. Powell is the latest felon released by the First Step Act to be re-arrested for additional crimes. Last year, Breitbart News chronicled the case of 41-year-old Joel Francisco, a notorious leader of the “Almighty Latin Kings” gang, who was freed by the First Step Act and arrested months later for allegedly murdering 46-year-old Troy Pine. Francisco was originally convicted in 2005 for dealing crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Days after his release by the First Step Act in February 2019, drug records reveal he immediately returned to using cocaine. As Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz noted, the number of felons who have been re-arrested since their release from prison by the First Step Act is not counted. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) pushed to include a provision that would have made public the felons who went on to commit additional crimes after their release and which would have notified victims of the felon’s release from prison. Kennedy’s provision, though, was tanked by 15 Senate Republicans who joined every Senate Democrat to vote the measure down. Those Senate Republicans who voted against the victim-protection measure include Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Bob Corker (R-TN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Dean Heller (R-NV), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Todd Young (R-IN).

"Monday during an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) pushed back against the suggestion Congress should be canceled because of the threat of the spread of the coronavirus. Brooks told WVNN’s “The Dale Jackson Show” that such a gesture would send the “wrong message,” adding he was aware of the CPAC situation. “Last night, I had communication with my staff that we may cancel Congress for some period of time,” Brooks said. “We also have Senator Ted Cruz and [Rep.] Paul Gosar, representative from Arizona, quarantined, closed their offices. Ten days ago, I was at a CPAC event where I spoke — two different segments of it. And apparently, there was a guy there with coronavirus, and then staffers from CPAC may have got it — staffers that I may have interacted with. Now, I’m feeling fine. But the idea that we should cancel Congress — I think that sends entirely the wrong message out.

"Rep. Jim Jordan’s (R-OH) office hit back at CNN on Monday after the outlet repackaged old allegations against him in a new story last week: He knew about alleged sexual misconduct by the wrestling team’s doctor while was a coach at Ohio State University. “Congressman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it,” said Jordan’s Communications Director Ian Fury in a statement. CNN published a piece on Friday, after Ohio State University (OSU) announced it had reached a settlement with 11 of the doctor’s victims in 18 pending cases. The piece cited six former student wrestlers who claimed they were present when Jordan “heard or responded to sexual misconduct complaints about team doctor Richard Strauss.” A senior Republican source close to Jordan blasted CNN for the report, which cites claims from some former wrestlers who have criminal records and are seeking monetary settlements from OSU. The source said in a statement: CNN was wrong about Russian collusion. CNN was wrong about Ukraine. CNN is now wrong about Jim Jordan. Ask anyone that knows him, but the idea that Congressman Jordan did anything wrong is ludicrous and CNN should be ashamed for even thinking otherwise. There is no evidence that Jordan knew of any abuse or complaints about the abuse when he served as assistant coach at OSU from 1987 to 1995. Strauss was the team doctor between 1979 and 1998. The doctor committed suicide in 2005. An investigation by law firm Perkins Coie for OSU said Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male student-patients during his time at OSU. The report does not say coaches were aware of the abuse, but that 22 unnamed coaches were “aware of rumors or complaints.” According to CNN, since that report, more former student wrestlers have come forward to testify about Strauss, and the Ohio House of Representatives is considering a bill that would lift the statute of limitations for victims to come forward and sue OSU. Jordan told CNN that those athletes accusing him of knowing about any abuse and not doing anything about it are not telling the truth. “I feel sorry for these guys, the fact that they aren’t telling the truth. I mean these are guys I trained with, these are guys I worked out with, I ran with, wrestled with, and the idea that now they are saying what they are, it’s just not true.” Jordan also noted that the investigation by Perkins Coie — the Democrat-linked law firm that hired Fusion GPS to produce the dossier claiming that candidate Donald Trump colluded with Russia — never mentioned his name. “What they’re saying is just not true,” he said. Dunyasha Yetts, one former wrestler, told CNN he complained to Jordan and then-head coach Russ Hellickson in 1992 after Strauss groped him during his initial physical exam, and again in 1993 when he injured his thumb and Strauss tried to remove his shorts. Yetts said he complained to Jordan and Jordan said something like, “If he tried that on me, I would kill him.” Yetts was the first one to claim that Jordan was aware of the abuse. He is suing OSU, and his case is not among those that were settled last week. Yetts served 18 months in prison starting in 2007 for a fraudulent investment scheme he ran between 1998 and 2001, where he lied to clients to obtain millions of dollars he used to pay back debts and for his lifestyle, according to UPI. His victims included Minnesota Vikings cornerback and OSU football player Antoine Winfield. He served another 60-day jail sentence and two more years of probation for violating rules while on probation, according to the report. Another former wrestler CNN cited was Adam DiSabato, who told Ohio state legislators in February that Jordan had called him in 2018 asking him to contradict statements his brother had made about Jordan knowing of Strauss’s abuse. “Jim Jordan called me crying, crying. Groveling. On the 4th of July, begging me to go against my brother. Begging me. Crying for a half hour. That’s the kind of cover-ups that’s going on there,” DiSabato told state legislators. DiSabato appeared at a protest last week with Melissa Ackison, a Republican running for the Ohio State Senate against opponent Ohio Rep. Bill Reineke (R), who is endorsed by Jordan. CNN said a “handful” who spoke to them had no knowledge of Jordan hearing about the abuse. At least two of them described Jordan as a supportive coach, and one said there is no way Jordan would not have intervened had he known about the abuse. “I would guess that, realistically, if you’re on the coaching staff you would know something about it, but whether they heard specifics and were more directly involved, that’s another question,” said Rick Burlenski. Another former wrestler, Mike Alf, who was at OSU between 1988 and 1992, said, “I know Jim Jordan… . He would do anything to protect us.” Then-head coach Hellickson told CNN in 2018 that he had a talk with Strauss about his physical contact with wrestlers and them being uncomfortable showering with him. He said Jordan may not have known about the alleged abuse. Numerous other former wrestlers and coaches have defended Jordan against knowing about any abuse. Their statements have been compiled into one website by the Jordan campaign, as noted by CNN.   Follow Breitbart News’ Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Jim Jordan’s Office Hits Back Against CNN Report He Knew About Doctor’s Sex Abuse: ‘Ludicrous’,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/jim-jordans-office-hits-back-against-cnn-report-he-knew-about-doctors-sex-abuse-ludicrous/,Breitbart
"Coronavirus task force expert Dr. Anthony Fauci claimed on Sunday that roughly four million test kits will be available by the end of next week. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted to “some missteps” by the administration in providing vital testing resources. “Early on, there were some missteps with regard to the test and some technical aspects to it,” Fauci said. “But right now, I believe, 1.1 million tests have already been sent out. By Monday, there’ll be an additional 400,000. And by the end of next week, probably around 4 million.” Fauci also said officials are getting a “better sense” of the magnitude of the coronavirus outbreak as the situation continues to escalate. “Unfortunately,” he said, “that ‘better sense’ is not encouraging, because we’re seeing community spread.” He then advised caution, especially for those in the most vulnerable populations. “If you’re a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, you need to think twice about getting on a plane, on a long trip,” he warned. “And not only think twice. Just don’t get on a cruise ship.” The Trump administration continues to face widespread criticism for its response to the global pandemic. As countries like Israel, Italy, and South Korea struggle to contain major outbreaks, the U.S. continues to lag behind in testing its population. Despite this, coronavirus has been officially confirmed in most states. President Donald Trump continues to downplay the pandemic, blaming the “Black Monday” stock market crash on coronavirus “fake news.” Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence continues to lead the public response. The conflicting messages have created the impression of a divide between the two leaders, though Pence has remained supportive of the POTUS. “President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the American people,” Pence said on Saturday. “It’s the reason why, from the first advent of the coronavirus in America, the president launched a whole of government approach, but as evidenced here today it’s not just a whole of government approach … but it’s really a whole of America approach.”",White House Expert Says 4 Million Coronavirus Tests Available Next Week,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/white-house-expert-says-4-million-coronavirus-tests-available-next-week/,Breitbart
"The White House announced Monday that President Donald Trump has not been tested for coronavirus. “The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients nor does he have any symptoms,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to reporters on Monday. Grisham cited the Centers for Disease Control guidelines, asking medical professionals to base their testing decisions on patient symptoms and exposure history. “President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,” Grisham said in her statement. Trump spent the weekend traveling with Rep. Matt Gaetz, who after returning to Washington, DC, aboard Air Force One admitted that he had contact with a CPAC attendee who tested positive for the disease. Gaetz announced that he would put himself in self-quarantine as a precaution. Three additional members of Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) also announced their decision to self-quarantine after learning they had contact with the individual infected with the virus. Incoming White House Chief of Staff and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) revealed on Monday night that he would also self-quarantine, as he might have been exposed to someone with the virus. Meadows took a test for the virus, which came back negative.

"A bill in the Wyoming legislation to criminalize the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) on minors that has bipartisan support is being slammed by transgender activists who claim it discriminates against those who might want surgery to alter their biological sex. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that as many as 200 million girls and women around the world are living with the harmful effects of FMG, which can include chronic pain, recurring infections, incontinence, sexual problems, and complications of pregnancy and labor that increase risk of death to the infant. Both Republicans and Democrats in the state are backing HBO127, which “defines FGM; classifies FGM as aggravated assault and battery; requires convictions of FGM be included on the child abuse registry; prohibits licensure of health care professionals who perform the procedure; mandates FGM be reported as child abuse; provides an avenue for victims of the procedure to recover damages; and calls for establishment of a community education program,” according to an online site focused on “gender identity.” “The site reported on opposition to the bill, citing Tara Muir, policy director of the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault (WCADVSA), has slammed the legislation as having the potential to place ‘draconian limits on transgender people.’”  The bill defines and describes FMG, according to the article:  “Female genital mutilation” includes the partial or total removal of the clitoris, prepuce, labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora, the narrowing of the vaginal opening such as through the creation of a covering seal formed by cutting and repositioning the inner or outer labia, with or without removal of the clitoris, any harmful procedure to the genitalia, including pricking, piercing, incising, scraping or cauterizing or any other actions intended to alter the structure or function of the female genitalia for non-medical reasons. HB0127 – Prohibition of female genital mutilation HBO 127 specifies that “sex reassignment surgery” is not prohibited “if the person on whom it is performed is over eighteen (18) years of age and requests and consents to the procedure.”  Although both Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that it is already “rare” for a doctor to allow a person under 18 to undergo gender-affirming surgeries, transgender activists are crying foul. Representative Sara Burlingame (D-Cheyenne) protested the language of the sex-reassignment clause as “bog[ging] this bill down with something that’s going to stop it in its tracks,” while Tara Muir of WCADVSA complained, “Wyoming cannot be the first state with such draconian limits on transgender people.”  Some discussion of the bill on social media included tweets about Renee Bergstrom, who faced FGM as a child in a religious cult. Tweets claimed Bergstrom’s use of the expression “female genital mutilation” is “transgender-exclusionary language, as not all people with vaginas are women, and not all women have vaginas.” ""Tweeters said Ms Bergstrom’s use of the phrase 'female genital mutilation' is transgender-exclusionary language.""

"MSNBC host Rachel Maddow on her Monday broadcast accused President Donald Trump of being “willing to lie to the people about things that will keep them alive,” referring to the coronavirus outbreak. Reading from an Associated Press report, Maddow said, “As bungled, is that the right word? That’s the nice word for it. As bungled as the response has been from our federal government, this is actually a problem of a different kind. And this is, this is the thing that I’ve sort of most been worried about. And it is apparently come to pass. Quote, ‘The White House overruled health officials who wanted to recommend that elderly and physically fragile Americans be advised not to fly on commercial airlines because of the new coronavirus.’ Quote, ‘The Centers for Disease Control submitted the plan as a way to control the virus, but White House officials ordered the air travel recommendation be removed,’ said one official who had direct knowledge of the plan.” She continued, “The Trump administration officials have since suggested that certain people should consider not traveling, but they’ve stopped short of the stronger guidance that was sought by the CDC. Quote ‘The person who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity did not have authorization to talk about this matter.’ So if this Associated Press report is correct, the Centers for Disease Control concluded internally, in what was presumably a science-driven process, that not just people with underlying health conditions, not just people with other health challenge, but all older Americans, should not fly. That was the CDC’s reported conclusion about the advice Americans should be given in the context of this virus, in order to keep ourselves safe and alive. Older Americans don’t get on planes.” She added, “If the best expert advice from the Centers for Disease Control says that all older Americans should not fly, and the White House has spiked that advice, for whatever reason, and so individual officials have to leak it, in order to let the American people know that’s the advice, this is an important moment in this crisis, right?

"Nicholas Pirelli pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the alleged rape of a student in his campus office whom he met online. 36-year-old Bridgewater State University communications professor Nicholas Pirelli stands accused of the rape of an unidentified student he met online through a “sugar daddy” matching site. According to police reports, Pirelli allegedly met with the young woman after offering to help her with an essay as well as her resume. Pirelli also allegedly offered to use his “connections as a professor” to get her work on the Massachusetts campus. After inviting her to a meeting in his office, Pirelli is said to have assisted the student with her essay for all of 30 minutes before abruptly kissing her. As she resisted, Pirelli allegedly forcibly removed her clothing and sexually assaulted her for approximately ten minutes. Afterward, he reportedly told her “good night” and left. “When interviewing the victim, several times she broke down and began crying,” the report says, concluding that “detectives found the victim credible throughout their interviews with her.” Previously, Pirelli allegedly asked for the student’s discretion — as well as “risky” pictures. He also took pictures of his own sex toy collection. Investigators found a “large cache” of communications between the two, some of which occurred after her alleged rape and “appeared to indicate from their tone” that the victim “may have found Pirelli’s actions acceptable to her.” She explained that the communications were “part of an effort to appease him,” police said, “in an attempt to ‘let him down easy’ and so as not to ruin her chances of obtaining employment through the university.” It is important to note that maintaining contact with the abuser is common after sexual assault and does not indicate the innocence of the accused. As with the promise of employment or influence, abusers often deliberately create a situation in which the cessation of contact will have devastating implied consequences — the most notable example being billionaire movie mogul and convicted sexual predator Harvey Weinstein. Despite the evidence at hand, Pirelli has denied any “physical encounters” in his office with the woman. According to the police report, “when confronted with the report of inappropriate touching, Pirelli stated, ‘That is extreme,’ and stated that he did nothing wrong.” Bridgewater State University has released a statement saying it “has zero tolerance for misconduct, abuse, or violence against any members of our campus community and is committed to preventing and holding accountable anyone responsible for acts of physical and sexual assault,” assuring the public it is “working closely with the district attorney’s office in their prosecution of this alleged crime.”",Massachusetts Professor Charged with Raping Student After Meeting Online,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/massachusetts-charged-raping-student-meeting-online/,Breitbart
"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is changing its debate format to limit the rigorous standing required by candidates, at a time when there is renewed scrutiny over former Vice President Joe Biden’s fitness for the White House. The DNC announced on Friday that the format for its next debate, to be held in Arizona on March 15, would have the candidates seated behind a desk, fielding questions from the audience. The format change, which was first reported by Politico, would be a departure from the past ten debates, where candidates stood behind lecterns and faced questions from moderators. “After ten debates, the DNC worked with its network partners to adapt the March debate to the smaller field of candidates and to give voters more of a voice,” a DNC spokeswoman said in announcing the new format. The change occurs as the Democrat field has winnowed, leaving Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as the only two viable candidates for the nomination. That process, which saw establishment Democrats consolidate behind the former vice president ahead of Super Tuesday, has left many Sanders supporters feeling as though the primary is being manipulated to thwart their candidate. Sanders, himself, granted credence to such thinking during a weekend appearance on ABC’s This Week. Sanders said, while discussing machinations that led to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Pete Buttigieg to dropping out and backing the former vice president: What was very clear from the media narrative and what the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and defeat me. We’re taking on the establishment… the corporate establishment … the political establishment. Given such feelings, it is no surprise that many on the left believe the DNC’s debate format change is meant to benefit Biden—a claim the former vice president’s team denies. The sentiment was best summed up by Glenn Greenwald, who took to social media shortly after the new format was announced to lambast what he saw as a transparent effort by the DNC to “protect” the former vice president. “What is Biden going to do if he’s the nominee and he doesn’t have the rotted DNC to protect him by corruptly changing the rules that let him basically lounge around in a bed taking questions from nice people instead of having to stand on his feet and directly debate,” Greenwald wrote. What is Biden going to do if he’s the nominee and he doesn’t have the rotted DNC to protect him by corruptly changing the rules that let him basically lounge around in a bed taking questions from nice people instead of having to stand on his feet and directly debate? https://t.co/W8Elnn98eO — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) March 8, 2020  Others were just as cutting in their criticism of the DNC’s decision. The DNC changed the debate rules not only to exclude Tulsi but to let the candidates sit down. And now the audience will ask questions instead of moderators. I have zero doubt that questions will be planted. It's so obvious that they're trying to protect Joe. — Secular Talk (@KyleKulinski) March 8, 2020  DNC has suddenly changed its debate rules AGAIN: Bernie & Biden will sit & take questions from audience, rather than stand for a moderated debate. In short: it's not a debate. This will only fuel concerns about Biden's cognitive decline & his ability to debate Trump this fall. https://t.co/wqexNADB6d — Dr. Jill Stein🌻 (@DrJillStein) March 9, 2020  Adding to suspicions about the DNC’s motives is that the format change comes as Biden faces renewed scrutiny about his fitness to be commander in chief. Although the 77-year-old former vice president has long been known for his gaffes and lapses, many Democrats now worry that such instances will only fuel speculation about his cognitive health—potentially damaging his chances in the general election. This was exhibited last week, most notably when Biden bungled a quote from the Declaration of Independence during a campaign swing through Texas. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created by, go, you know, you know the thing,” the former vice president said, visibly struggling to remember the famous line. That moment was quickly eclipsed by the former vice president urging voters to show up and support his campaign on “Super Thursday.” The back-to-back verbal missteps, followed up by Biden confusing his wife and sister during a speech in California, led even some senior Democrats to confess the former vice president’s cognitive health was an issue. “He is a candidate that is mentally deteriorating. People in the Democratic establishment say, ‘Oh don’t say that.’ They really believe that they can shield Joe Biden from public scrutiny and the reality is, they can’t,” Justin Horwtiz, a Democratic strategist and Sanders supporter, admitted during an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight.",DNC Changes Debate Rules to Allow Candidates to Sit as Questions Mount Over Biden’s Fitness,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/dnc-changes-debate-rules-to-allow-candidates-to-sit-as-questions-mount-over-bidens-fitness/,Breitbart
"During a town hall on the Fox News Channel on Monday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stated that he wouldn’t “go at that level” by attacking fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden’s mental acuity and “that’s for people to decide.” Moderator Bret Baier said, “[T]he question of Joe Biden’s mental acuity is not something that just comes up anywhere” before playing clips of Democrats raising the issue. Sanders responded, “I’m not going to go at that level in attacking. Joe and I have — you know, that’s for people to decide. All I can say is, Joe and I have very significant political differences. And I’m not going to be making personal attacks on Joe. That’s not what I do.” Earlier, Sanders cited a speech that Biden gave that only lasted seven minutes, stating, “I don’t know how you say anything, other than minimal discussion in seven minutes.” Sanders later denied that he was suggesting Biden lacked substance, but added, “If I’m going to give a speech to people…I can’t do it in seven minutes. You know, there are too many issues. There’s health care, education, climate change, immigration reform, criminal justice reform. I don’t know how you do that in seven minutes.

"A survey conducted by the Job Creators Network (JCN) showed that small business owners — employers with less than 500 employees — found that 79.4 percent want free market-based healthcare as opposed to Medicare for All or a Public Option. JNC also asked the 703 local business owners how they think the Trump administration has handled economic issues; 66 percent of the small business owners responded with “good” or “great.” “When asked who they would vote for if the election was held tomorrow and the Democratic candidate was Joe Biden, more than 73 percent said they would vote for Donald Trump,” the survey said. That number jumped to 77 percent who said they would vote to re-elect President Trump if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was the Democratic candidate. “The results speak for themselves: small business owners are thriving and attribute much of their continued success to the pro-growth policies pushed by the current administration,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, in a press release. “Additionally, the support for free market healthcare reform aligns with recent efforts of the Job Creators Network Foundation and Physicians for Reform,” Ortiz said. “The Healthcare for You framework aims to inject choice and competition into the healthcare market–giving Americans the decision-making power they want and deserve. Entrepreneurs don’t want a progressive or socialist playing puppet master with businesses and the economy. The free market should be doing the heavy lifting.” When asked what the top three areas of concern are for them, 56.7 percent of the group of small business owners said high taxes, another 39.8 percent said healthcare, and 37.6 said the Coronavirus concerns them.

"Two pediatricians say data from a study published at the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) actually reveals the opposite of what its authors conclude – that puberty blockers are linked to positive mental health outcomes in youth claiming to be transgender. In the February issue of Pediatrics, Drs. Jack L. Turban, Dana King, Jeremi M. Carswell, and Alex S. Keuroghlian, asserted that “pubertal suppression for transgender adolescents who want this treatment is associated with favorable mental health outcomes.” “There is a significant inverse association between treatment with pubertal suppression during adolescence and lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who ever wanted this treatment,” the authors concluded from their data. Two pediatricians, however, both board members of the American College of Pediatricians, which has posted a position statement on child gender dysphoria and the consequences of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatments, said the data actually reveal the opposite of what Turban and his associates claim. “Given the controversy surrounding the practice of puberty suppression for gender dysphoric adolescents, the article by Turban et al creates more confusion than clarity,” wrote Drs. Scott Field and Den Trumbull in a comment responding to the journal article. The authors of the study used a cross-sectional survey of 20,619 transgender adults between the ages of 18 and 36. They examined the adults’ self-reported history of puberty blocking drugs during adolescence and then studied “associations between access to pubertal suppression and adult mental health outcomes, including multiple measures of suicidality.” The researchers found that 90 percent of the transgender adults who wanted, but were unable to obtain, puberty blockers experienced suicidal thoughts. However, 75 percent of transgender adults who received puberty blocking drugs experienced the same suicidal thoughts. Turban and his colleagues reported 16.9 percent of those adults surveyed self-reported they “ever wanted” to take puberty blockers. Of these participants, 2.5 percent received the drugs. The authors concluded: After adjustment for demographic variables and level of family support for gender identity, those who received treatment with pubertal suppression, when compared with those who wanted pubertal suppression but did not receive it, had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation. In examining the data, however, Field and Trumbull addressed several problems with the study: The authors imply causal evidence for a reduction in suicidal ideation with transgender adolescents who received puberty suppression (PS), yet they fail to acknowledge the exceedingly high rates in both groups of suicide ideation (75% and 90%) and suicide attempts (42% and 51%). The pediatricians observed flaws in the design of Turban et al’s study: The cross-sectional design using online survey data is insufficient to validate the efficacy of such a life-altering therapy. Because the data was collected by survey, there is no way of knowing how many would-be participants in either group actually succumbed to suicide. The so-called “lifetime suicidal ideation” is misleading, since at the time of the survey, the PS treatment group was significantly (p=001) younger (mean age 21.7 years) than the “ever wanted” PS control group (mean age 23.4 years), and the total age range of survey participants was 18 to 36 years. With mean age of hormone treatment initiation being 15.7 years in the PS group and 22.5 in the control group (p<0.001), it is obvious that the follow-up time for both groups was far too brief to assess “lifetime suicidal ideation.” The control group was not appropriately matched to the treatment group by age at time of survey or by age when hormone therapy was begun. Since there were over 30 controls for each PS case, they could have been selectively trimmed to be better matched. Field and Trumbull then noted the outcome is actually the opposite of what the authors claim: What is more disturbing is that the PS treated group actually had double (45.5% versus 22.8%) the rates of the control group for serious (resulting in inpatient care) suicide attempts in the year preceding the data collection. The pediatricians identified another study that found adolescents who identify as transgender, as well as those who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual, are increasing at “extraordinary rates,” specifically, doubled between 2009 and 2017. “[T]hese adolescents are almost four times more likely than their heterosexual peers to commit suicide,” Field and Trumbull noted. “The same study found that over 35% of adolescent suicide attempts in 2017 came from sexual minorities, who comprised only 14% of the adolescent population.” According to the pediatricians, there are no long-term studies proving puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or “gender-confirming surgery” are either safe or effective. They added these treatments “potentially render recipients sterile, physically altered, and sexually dysfunctional,” and, therefore, should be considered “experimental” until longitudinal studies can prove otherwise. “The prevailing narrative that these interventions are necessary to prevent suicide is without reasonable evidence,” Field and Trumbull asserted. Turban said in January that his findings add to the “growing evidence base suggesting that gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth is associated with superior mental health outcomes in adulthood,” reported NBC News. “It certainly argues against the misguided notion that gender-affirming care is inherently harmful and should be legislatively banned,” he added, apparently referring to several bills introduced in states attempting to ban transgender drugs and surgeries for children. Turban is a psychiatrist who was nominated for NBC Out’s #Pride30 list by producer Andy Cohen, who praised the psychiatrist’s efforts to “bring the stories of transgender youth to the general public” and “build empathy and support” for the trans community. “I’m a cisgender, gay white man,” Turban told NBC Out. “I recognize my privilege. We’ve made so much progress in LGB health, but the T was left behind.” Turban’s co-authors, King and Keuroghlian, are affiliated with the Fenway Institute, an interdisciplinary center for research, training, education, and policy development regarding LGBT individuals.",Pediatricians Say Study Approving Puberty Blockers for Adolescents Is Flawed,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/pediatricians-say-study-approving-puberty-blockers-for-adolescents-is-flawed/,Breitbart
"U.S. Senate Finance Committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) told Breitbart News exclusively that his plan to reform prescription drug pricing would specifically focus on reining in federal taxpayer spending on drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid plans. “The bill would basically reform a lot of federal spending on health care, particularly through Medicare, Medicaid,” Grassley said in an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel about his bipartisan Senate prescription drug plan with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). “We would reduce subsidies from Medicare to the pharmaceuticals. We would put a year-over-year cap on price increases at the rate of inflation. We would put a big cap on the amount of money that one consumer would have to spend out-of-pocket. It would save the taxpayers about 80 billion dollars. It would take some of the secrecy out of the pricing of drugs. It would take some of the secrecy out of the middle man that we call a pharmaceutical benefits managers (PBMs), because all that secrecy keeps the marketplace from working, and more transparency would enhance competition. And with the more transparency you get more accountability, and we don’t have that accountability today. It would do away with the donut hole that I won’t explain, but it’s been a controversial part of Part D since it was established in 2003. But the main thing is it would cause the marketplace to work. It would stop subsidies to Big Pharma. Well, not stop subsidies, but it would limit the subsidies, because presently there’s no limit on how much they can increase drug prices – this year five to ten percent – and it ought to be limited to the inflation rate. So that’s a broad summary. It does a lot more than what I just told you.” Grassley’s bipartisan bill rivals a partisan House bill from Speaker Nancy Pelosi that only has Democrat support in the House. When asked to describe the difference between the plans, Grassley cited the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which laid out how his bill would not adversely affect innovation of new treatments and cures of diseases and also would have a positive impact on prescription drug prices for patients not using Medicare or Medicaid—in other words, not using taxpayer funds—to cover the costs of their prescriptions. Pelosi’s bill does not get the same ratings, and Grassley said hers would “interfere” with “the practice of medicine.” “You would say that hers gets all sorts of drugs, but you mention the idea with Medicare and Medicaid – but don’t forget, so much that the government sets a policy that carries over to the private sector,” Grassley said. “So the Congressional Budget Office says that my bill would also cut down on a non-Medicare people, consumers purchasing drugs. It would also not hurt innovation — I’m quoting Congressional Budget Office — it wouldn’t hurt innovation like hers hurts innovation. But she would take the heavy-handed approach of, instead of the marketplace working, having the government-set prices, which would basically reduce the amount of pills that are in a formulary, so that the government would be getting between you and your doctor and what the doctor might want to prescribe. We don’t want to interfere with the practice of medicine. I think her bill would. It would for sure reduce the formulary, because it follows the pattern of the VA Administration, Veterans Administration, where they dictate prices and the formularies [to] about two-thirds of what you get under Medicare, where there’s market and consumer choice, and doctor prescriptions are making the decision what you ought to take as a pill.” Asked again about the innovation claim—critics of Grassley’s efforts sometimes say that such moves may harm efforts by pharmaceutical companies to develop more effective treatments or even cures to significant diseases. Grassley pointed again to CBO, which said his plan would not hurt innovation in any way. “This may be too short of answer, but since I’m in politics, I always like to quote professional people, and so the Congressional Budget Office—even though it’s an arm of Congress they’re professional people—and they said our bill does not hurt innovation in any way and they say just the opposite about the Pelosi bill, and then you also got to remember from a political standpoint the Grassley-Wyden bill. Wyden is the Democrat helping me and he’s from Oregon and he’s the ranking member on the committee,” Grassley said. “We have the only bipartisan bill that is going to get 60 votes in the United States Senate, so you could lie to progressives like the Pelosi bill, but it would never get through the United States Senate. We’ve got a bipartisan bill that can become law and do what the president—actually the president was six months ahead of Congress by June of 2018 giving a major speech in this area and doing through regulation what he wanted to accomplish to get drug prices down. Our bill works in conjunction with what the president’s trying to do and we’ve only got the only bill that can get 60 votes in the Senate.” On the political side of this, several GOP senators up for re-election in battleground states—from Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), who just drew a challenger in Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, to Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Martha McSally (R-AZ)—are all co-sponsors of Grassley’s bill with Wyden. Grassley noted that this effort could help the GOP get stronger with the voting public on healthcare, an issue Democrats have led on in polling for some time. He also noted that President Donald Trump has been supportive of his efforts on this front and he believes that passing it would help President Trump get re-elected. “I want to help President Trump get re-elected. President Trump is right on the prescription drug thing,” Grassley said. “I give him credit for bringing this up six or seven months before I ever got to be chairman of this committee and I’m bringing it up. It happens that Republicans don’t have a healthcare message, and that came out strongly in a lot of resentment expressed to the leadership of our caucus in our retreat a week ago Wednesday. Democrats have a very strong message and you may have read where the president was irritated in the Oval Office to Secretary Azar because the president had such poor poll numbers on health and the reason the president has such poor poll numbers on it is because the Republicans in the United States Senate aren’t working to back him. We do have a good record on the economy, creating jobs, the booming economy, but wage growth doesn’t mean as much if it’s going to be spent all your increase in wages is going to be spent on expensive prescription drug refills every month. You bring up control of the United States Senate. Senator Daines in Montana is going to have a tougher race now that the governor announced against him. Senator McSally and Senator Ernst and Senator Collins—we need to get them all re-elected. Leader McConnell can help by bringing this to a vote and then I guess I said this too many times that this is the only bipartisan bill they can get votes in the United States Senate and we got to get around it if we are going to get ahead of the Democrats on health care because they’ve been outbidding us with the voters on healthcare for a long period of time. It’s because the president’s out front. He needs to talk about it more, but he needs to get the Senate to move on our bill.” Grassley is working on getting more GOP senators to support his effort. More than a dozen already do, but he’s looking for even more support to be able to convince Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put his bill on the floor and force Pelosi’s hand by passing it out of the Senate. Asked to make his case to his Republican colleagues, Grassley said policy-wise they are already with him on this—and it is a purely political question at this stage as to whether they will get on board with it. “Well, I shouldn’t have to worry about policy because what we’re doing is the best policy for conservatives,” Grassley said. “We’re trying to save the taxpayers money, we’re trying to reduce subsidies to the corporate welfare that we condemn so often and all that. So, I shouldn’t have to argue policy. So, it’s all about politics. We don’t have a message. We need a message ,and prescription drug pricing is one of the three or four top issues in elections, and some surveys say it’s the number one issue. In my state of Iowa, I hear about it all the time and Ernst does. If we can get this to a vote we aren’t going to have trouble getting a majority of Republicans on board and so far I think that a lot of people would like to support our bill, but they don’t know if it’s going to come up, and why put your name on the dotted line if you might not have to deal with it? That’s why the president working with McConnell can get this bill up, and once we get a bill up we’ll get it passed.” Asked what the public can do to help him if they support his bill, Grassley asked the audience of Breitbart News to call their senators and back his bill—which has the president’s support—by cosponsoring it. “Help the president of the United States who deserves more credit than I do for bringing this issue up because in the summer of 2018 he made a very major speech about the necessity of getting drug prices down,” Grassley said. “He was filing on things that he said during his campaign—he got elected on it, and he wants to be successful on it. He wants to run for re-election on it. It won’t happen unless your listeners, the Breitbart listeners, get on their United States Senator to do two things; One, get on the bill as a co-sponsor. And then urge the Republican senators to urge McConnell to bring it up and then praise the president for his leadership and say since this is one of the three or four major issues before the voters right now and the Democrats have outperformed us on healthcare messaging we’ve got to increase our messaging. There’s a hundred ways you can talk about healthcare but the thing that really hits the pocketbooks of the consumers is the price of prescription drugs—it’s one of the three or four top things and this is a necessity for movement if we want to re-elect the president of the United States and we want to keep a majority in the United States Senate.” LISTEN TO SEN.

"The Working Families Party (WFP), which previously endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), formally backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Monday. The influential left-wing group announced on Monday, the day prior to the March 10 primary contests, that it is backing Sanders’ presidential bid and will work to persuade Warren supporters in joining his movement: BREAKING: We’re endorsing @BernieSanders for president!

Organized capital won’t rest and neither will we,” WFP National Director Maurice Mitchell said in a statement, according to Politico. Mitchell continued: We said from the very beginning that there were two progressive champions in this race, and that our North Star was to elect one of them as president. Now, the Working Families Party will marshal its grassroots supporters and staff to help Sen. Sanders win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump. The Sanders campaign and supporters initially signaled concern after the WFP, which supported Sanders in 2015, backed Warren over the Vermont senator. Sanders ultimately had to address accusations of his supporters launching “hateful, violent and racist threats” toward those associated with the WFP after it endorsed his rival. As Breitbart News reported: Black leaders — including Black Lives Matter leaders, like co-founder Patrisse Cullors — signed a letter, which condemned the “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space,” Sanders said following the release of the letter. “We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House”: This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space.

"Incoming White House Chief of Staff and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) revealed on Monday night that he will self-quarantine, as he might have been exposed to someone who had the novel coronavirus. Meadows spokesman Ben Williamson said in a statement on Monday: Rep. Meadows was advised this weekend that he may have come in contact with the CPAC attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, now 12 days ago. Out of an abundance of caution, Meadows received testing which came back negative. While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he’ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday. Meadows joins a growing list of lawmakers that may have been exposed to coronavirus after attending CPAC two weeks ago. Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-TX), Doug Collins (R-GA), and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) have announced over the last two days that they may have been exposed to coronavirus after attending the conservative conference two weeks ago. Gohmert said in a statement on Monday: Saturday night, I got a call from the House physician advising that I had been possibly been exposed to the COVID-19 virus at CPAC on February 27th, and that a top CDC physician in Atlanta would call me to discuss what should be done going forward…I was and am asymptomatic. Meadows’s announcement follows as President Donald Trump and the White House commenced several steps to help Americans suffering economically from the spread of the coronavirus. President Trump said that he would meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss a payroll tax cut, financial assistance for hourly workers, loans for small businesses, and financial aid for the airline and cruise industries. The president said, “We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American public and the American economy.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"We’ve been in court for years over Hillary Clinton’s emails — as you know, we are persistent for justice. The great news is that U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth has granted our request to depose the former secretary of state about her emails and Benghazi attack documents. The court also ordered the deposition of Clinton’s former Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, and two other State Department officials. Additionally, the court granted our request to subpoena Google for relevant documents and records associated with Clinton’s emails during her tenure at the State Department. The ruling comes in our lawsuit seeking records concerning “talking points or updates on the Benghazi attack” (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01242)). Remember, it was Judicial Watch that discovered in 2014 that the “talking points” that provided the basis for Susan Rice’s false statements were created by the Obama White House. This FOIA lawsuit led directly to the disclosure of the Clinton email system in 2015. In December 2018, Judge Lamberth first ordered discovery into whether Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server was intended to stymie FOIA; whether the State Department’s intent to settle this case in late 2014 and early 2015 amounted to bad faith; and whether the State Department has adequately searched for records responsive to our request. The court also authorized discovery into whether the Benghazi controversy motivated the cover-up of Clinton’s email. The court ruled that the Clinton email system was “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.” The State and Justice Departments continued to defend Clinton’s and the agency’s email conduct. Judge Lamberth has now overruled Clinton’s and the State and Justice Department’s objections to limited additional discovery by first noting: Discovery up until this point has brought to light a noteworthy amount of relevant information, but Judicial Watch requests an additional round of discovery, and understandably so. With each passing round of discovery, the Court is left with more questions than answers. Additionally, Judge Lamberth said that he is troubled by the fact that both the State Department and Department of Justice want to close discovery in this case: [T]here is still more to learn. Even though many important questions remain unanswered, the Justice Department inexplicably still takes the position that the Court should close discovery and rule on dispositive motions. The Court is especially troubled by this. To argue that the Court now has enough information to determine whether State conducted an adequate search is preposterous, especially when considering State’s deficient representations regarding the existence of additional Clinton emails. Instead, the Court will authorize a new round of discovery With respect to Clinton, the court found that her prior testimony, mostly through written sworn answers, was not sufficient: The Court has considered the numerous times in which Secretary Clinton said she could not recall or remember certain details in her prior interrogatory answers. In a deposition, it is more likely that the plaintiff’s counsel could use documents and other testimony to attempt to refresh her recollection. And so, to avoid the unsatisfying and inefficient outcome of multiple rounds of fruitless interrogatories and move this almost six-year-old case closer to its conclusion, Judicial Watch will be permitted to clarify and further explore Secretary Clinton’s answers in person and immediately after she gives them. The Court agrees with Judicial Watch – it is time to hear directly from Secretary Clinton. We uncovered the Clinton email scandal and we’re pleased that the court authorized us to depose Mrs. Clinton directly on her email conduct and how it impacted the people’s ‘right to know’ under FOIA. The deposition must take place by May 16, so stay tuned.","Fitton: Victory!

"Hundreds of flights from quarantined Italy, due to the rapid outbreak of the coronavirus which began in Wuhan, China, are continuing to the interior of the United States. In Italy, government officials have implemented a quarantine for the entire country in an effort to contain the coronavirus, as deaths have increased to 463 and the number of cases reaches nearly 9,200. The quarantine includes the heavily-affected Lombardy region that includes three airports in and around Milan. Flights from these three airports — Milan Linate Airport, Il Caravaggio Orio al Serio International Airport, and Malpensa Airport — are continuing to the U.S. despite the coronavirus quarantine, as well as flights to the U.S. from the Venice, Italy region. Currently, hundreds of flights from in-or-around Milan to the U.S. remain listed on travel websites like Kayak.com. For the coming week, quarantined Italian residents can book from about 15 to 20 daily roundtrip flights to New York City, New York, from Milan starting at $360. A map on Kayak.com shows flights from coronavirus-quarantined zones in and around Milan, Italy to the United States for this month. (Kayak.com) Other flights allow quarantined Italian residents to fly roundtrip from Milan to Atlanta, Georgia, for as cheap as $580. Tickets for these flights range as high as $745 with layovers in Rome, Italy, and Paris, France. Italian residents quarantined near Venice can also take flights to multiple U.S. cities like Miami, Florida, Dallas, Texas, Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Chicago, Illinois. A flight this month roundtrip from Venice to New York City costs travelers as little as $511. Meanwhile, daily roundtrip flights from Venice to Salt Lake City start at about $1,200. Daily flights from South Korea to the U.S. are also continuing with little-to-no changes. For instance, travelers arriving in the U.S. from Seoul, South Korea, can book a roundtrip flight this month to Denver, Colorado, for less than $1,000. South Korean travelers can also book trips to major U.S. cities like Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Boston, Massachusetts. A map on Kayak.com shows daily flights from South Korea to the United States. The flights have continued despite an outbreak of the coronavirus in South Korea with nearly 7,500 cases and 53 deaths. (Kayak.com) The daily flights to the U.S. from coronavirus-affected Italy and South Korea come as the State Department has yet to issue travel bans for either of the countries. The only travel bans implemented thus far have been for residents and recent visitors of China and Iran. As Breitbart News reported, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport officials confirmed that travelers from Italy and South Korea are not being medically screened once they have arrived in the U.S., but rather they are screened before boarding their flights overseas. To date, there are nearly 600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. and a total of 22 deaths.

But only the most ignorant and racist among us would call it the Wuhan virus. — Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) March 9, 2020  This is irresponsible as well as designed to prompt prejudice. I'd tell you to do better, but I don't think you can. — Jess Phoenix 🌋 (@jessphoenix2018) March 9, 2020  The stupidity, the ignorance behind this is simply astounding, but unfortunately, not at all surprising anymore. Naming a virus after the location from where it likely originated, using that as a shorthand, goes back decades. “Wuhan” was first discovered in Wuhan, China. Ebola was named after a river close to where an outbreak took place in Africa. Lyme disease was named after a Connecticut town experienced an outbreak in 1975. The Zika virus was named after a forest in Uganda in 1947, where scientists discovered what it was. The Marburg virus was first discovered in Marburg, Germany. The West Nile virus is what causes West Nile fever… guess where… Did you know Legionnaires’ disease is named that because the first notable outbreak killed off a bunch of legionnaires in attendance at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia back in 1976? So we literally have decades of precedent in naming diseases after where they were first discovered, including a town in lily-white Connecticut. Good heaven, we have a disease named after a bunch of white, middle-aged legionnaires — but “Wuhan” is now racist. Need I add that “Wuhan” is not even a race? And that anti-science thinking is why Trump won the presidency.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"President Donald Trump announced several major steps forward on Monday at the White House to help Americans suffering economically from fears of the spread of the coronavirus. “We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American public and the American economy,” Trump said. The president announced that he would meet with lawmakers in Washington, DC, on Tuesday to discuss a payroll tax cut, financial assistance for hourly wage earners, loans for small businesses, and financial assistance for the airline and cruise industries. “It’s not their fault, and it’s not this country’s fault,” Trump said about the people affected financially by the ongoing fight. The president’s solutions echoed several proposals detailed by Breitbart Senior Economics Editor John Carney on Monday morning. Trump again praised his own decision to suspend travel from China and establish screening in airports, noting that it helped slow the spread of the virus while Americans could prepare for the response. Trump also thanked Vice President Mike Pence and the Coronavirus Task Force for their efforts. “We have a very strong economy, but this blindsided the world and I think we’ve handled it very, very well,” Trump said. Pence repeated his assertion from medical professionals that the risk of contracting the coronavirus was still low. “The risk of contracting the coronavirus to the American public remains low, and the risk of serious disease among the American public also remains low,” he said. The vice president urged all Americans to visit the website coronavirus.gov for details on how to fight the virus, including “common sense” ways to mitigate the spread. “Together we will get through the coronavirus,” Pence said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reaffirmed his confidence in the strength of the economy, despite the historic slump in the stock market on Monday, calling it “the most resilient economy in the world.” He said that the president would act to provide “whatever support is needed” to help strengthen the economy in the upcoming days. The president appeared at the White House press briefing room with his team on Monday evening to discuss the response to the spread of the virus after returning to Washington, DC from Florida. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) announced that he would isolate himself after learning he had personal contact with a person at CPAC who tested positive for coronavirus, after traveling to Washington from Florida with the president on Air Force One, Gaetz was put into a “closed up” room on Air Force One after he found out he might have been exposed to the virus, according to a reporter who spoke to the congressman. Gaetz spent the weekend with Trump, traveling and dining with the president, including at a fundraiser on Monday, prompting questions about whether or not he was in danger of contracting the disease. Twenty-six people have died from the virus with over 690 Americans testing positive for the disease. Trump did not answer any questions at the press briefing, and Pence said he was unaware whether or not the president had been tested but reassured reporters that he was being monitored by his doctors. Pence also confirmed that he himself had not been tested for the disease.",Donald Trump Announces Financial Assistance for Americans Impacted by Coronavirus,2020-03-09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/09/donald-trump-announces-financial-assistance-for-americans-impacted-by-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"TEL AVIV – Russia’s top diplomat met with the head of Gaza-based terror group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), prompting outrage from Israel, who filed an official protest to Moscow. ﻿According to the Russian foreign ministry’s website, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his deputy, Mikhail Bogdanov, met with Palestinian Islamic Jihad secretary-general Ziyad al-Nakhalah Wednesday night in Moscow to discuss  “the task of speedy restoration of Palestinian national unity on the political platform of the Palestinian Liberation Organization as a necessary condition for establishing sustainable direct negotiations with Israel.” Gaza, which is run by the Hamas-terror group, has long been at odds with the Palestinian Authority-run West Bank and multiple attempts to build a unity government have failed. According to Iran’s Press TV, the two held “positive” and “profound” talks that also focused on the Trump administration’s plan for Israel-Palestinian peace. PIJ representatives voiced their firm opposition to the US scheme, saying it strives to “eliminate the Palestinian problem, as well as to give up Jerusalem [al-Quds], the West Bank and the right of return of refugees,” the report said, citing Palestine Today website. “The Palestinian people will never give up their historical rights and national principles,” the PIJ representatives were quoted as saying. Israel’s interim ambassador to Russia, Eli Belocerkovsky, denounced the meeting in a letter to Bogdanov.  PIJ, Belocerkovsky noted, is a “terrorist organization supported by Iran that does not recognize Israel’s right to exist and systematically undermines arrangements in the Gaza Strip by attacking Israeli civilians.” The Russian foreign ministry said its representatives had “reaffirmed its firm commitment to the two-state principle” in the meeting. Islamic Jihad has long rejected the idea of two states, a Jewish and a Palestinian one, living side by side, and routinely calls for the annihilation of Israel. The Russia’s embassy in Israel tweeted photos of the meeting, including one of Lavrov and Nakhala shaking hands, but deleted the tweet. According to The Jerusalem Post, the embassy’s spokesman defended the deletion saying, “This topic concerns the Russian Representative Office in Ramallah, and they have their own Twitter account.” Nakhala’s ties with Iran and its Lebanese terror proxy Hezbollah are strong, and the PIJ chief splits his time between Lebanon and neighboring Syria. He is said to have close ties with Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Iranian Quds Force killed by the US earlier this year. Much of the PIJ’s terror activities, including rocket barrages into Israel, are green-lighted by Tehran. He is fluent in Hebrew, the result of spending time in an Israeli jail following an 1971 arrest for his role in Arab Liberation Forces terror attacks. His life sentence was cut short in a 1985 prisoner exchange deal. Three years later, Israel arrested him again and he was deported to Lebanon. In 2018, he was appointed secretary-general of the PIJ, the second-largest terror group in Gaza after Hamas.",Israel Slams Russian FM for Meeting with Islamic Jihad Terror Leader,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/12/israel-slams-russian-fm-for-meeting-with-islamic-jihad-terror-leader/,Breitbart
"Former Vice President Joe Biden proposed his plan to combat the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday by rejoining the Paris climate treaty, contending that there is a “well-documented” link between climate change and public health risks. Biden released his plan to fight the Wuhan virus outbreak and “prepare for future global health threats.” He added that climate change is a “driver of health threats.” In his proposal, the former vice president promised to rejoin the Paris climate treaty “on day one” of his presidential administration” and “lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets.” However, it remains questionable how much good rejoining the Paris climate treaty will do ten months after the former vice president released his plan to combat the coronavirus outbreak. “The link between climate change and health security is well-documented and will create a growing threat to Americans,” Biden wrote. “As President, Biden will fully integrate climate change into our foreign policy and global health security strategies, and prioritize efforts to mitigate disease and migration challenges caused by a warming planet,” he said. The former vice president also said that they would advance the Global Health Security Agenda “to respond to pandemic threats whether caused by natural causes and climate changes, bioterrorism, or laboratory accidents.” Biden also promised to have health experts communicate with the public to combat alleged xenophobia that has followed since the coronavirus outbreak. During Biden’s speech on Thursday, he attacked President Donald Trump for spreading “xenophobia” for describing the coronavirus as a “foreign” virus. “This communication is essential to combating the dangerous epidemic of fear, chaos, and stigmatization that can overtake communities faster than the virus,” Biden said. “Acts of racism and xenophobia against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community must not be tolerated,” he added.

"A pair of Democrat senators offered rare praise of President Donald Trump’s plans to block travel from Europe to prevent additional coronavirus cases coming into the United States. “It seems like of the 35 states that now have coronaviruses, 30 of them have originated in Europe, so I think it’s a wise move,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IlL) said in an interview the New York Post. I think it’s a good step, absolutely,” Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), a moderate Democrat in from a ruby-red state, told the Post. “The fact of the matter is we’re going to have to take some very serious steps.” “And I think the administration started that yesterday. I wish they would have started things a little bit earlier,” he added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declined to criticize the move when asked about it during her weekly press conference Thursday, saying she deferred to task force member Anthony Fauci on the matter. “Dr. Fauci said it was a scientific medical decision. I have a great confidence in Dr. Fauci,” the speaker said. “It’s a decision they made,” she said, adding: “we’ll see whether it’s worth the trouble. I’m here about what we can do to go forward for America’s — putting families first without having a criticism of one of the other things that the president is doing.” Addressing the nation from the Oval Office of the White House, President Trump said the United States will ban travel from European countries for 30 days beginning at midnight Friday in order to prevent new cases of the coronavirus from entering the country. “After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans,” Trump said. President Trump said the ban will not affect travel from Britain and there will be exemptions for Americans overseas who have undergone appropriate screenings. President Trump said he is also instructing the Small Business Administration to provide low-interest loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus and asking Congress to increase funding for this program by $50 billion and provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called for authority over the coronavirus outbreak to be handed to an emergency bipartisan group of experts and to Congress rather than President Donald Trump. Sanders called on President Trump to declare an “emergency” — something Trump already did on Jan. 31 — and then added that the president should essentially, be replaced: Because President Trump is unwilling and unable to lead selflessly, we must immediately convene an emergency bipartisan authority of experts to support and direct a response [to coronavirus] that is comprehensive, compassionate, and based first and foremost on science and fact. In other words, Congress in a bipartisan manner must take responsibility for addressing this unparalleled crisis. Sanders did not explain what constitutional mechanism he would use to transfer the president’s authority. The democratic socialist from Vermont also blamed America’s health care system for the crisis, saying the U.S. was at a disadvantage “because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right.” He also warned that “the number of casualties may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II.” Sanders and his rival for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden, each gave addresses Thursday — both highly partisan in tone and critical of the president’s efforts thus far. Biden released a plan for confronting the pandemic that repeated many steps Trump has already taken, and added a few others — including action to fight climate change, though it did not explain what one issue had to do with the other. Both Sanders and Biden opposed President Trump’s early decision to ban travel from China in January. Sanders said last week that he would not close the borders of the country to stop the spread of the coronavirus from abroad. Joel B.

"In what may be a signal to opponents of the Second Amendment, presidential candidate Joe Biden has hired Robert “Beto” O’Rourke’s former campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon to lead his campaign. “This is a conversation that has been happening over the course of weeks and was confirmed today it will be announced. And I think everyone who is either family or in senior-level positions in the campaign understands that it’s happening,” a source told CBS News. Biden and O’Rourke were together before the Texas primary, where the frontrunner praised his former opponent and, specifically, his stance on the Second Amendment. Biden said O’Rourke would be “the one who leads” Biden’s gun control efforts if he is elected to the White House. But O’Rourke’s campaign strategy on grabbing guns fell flat even with Democrats. O’Rourke dropped out in November — before a single vote had even been cast.
FiveThirtyEight reported: O’Rourke’s tumble in the polls was also accompanied by fundraising difficulties. Having been a prodigious fundraiser in 2018, he seemed capable of attracting the resources to run a top-level presidential campaign, and he showed early promise by raising $6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign, the second best opening day after only former Vice President Joe Biden. But fundraising dollars started drying up shortly thereafter. He had raised only $13 million by the end of the second quarter, and added just another $4.5 million in the third quarter. His debate performances didn’t help him recover either; in fact, his most recent performance seemed to have hurt him. After the October debate, O’Rourke’s net favorability among Democratic primary voters fell by about 6 points in our post-debate poll with Ipsos, the biggest decline for any of the 12 candidates on stage. His place at future debates was in serious jeopardy, too. O’Rourke was two qualifying polls shy of making the November debate and had yet to register a single qualifying survey for the December debate. Now, the very same person who oversaw that will now be shepherding Biden to the November election. “This is a very positive step, to appoint somebody with the broad perspectives that she brings of working within the party and in presidential election cycles,” the anonymous source told CBS News. “The campaign needs a decisionmaker — a single point of management. It didn’t have one. It was needed.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"U.S. stocks plunged lower Thursday as investors feared that stimulus measures would be inadequate and likely come too late to prevent the economy from slipping into a recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 10 percent, near its intraday lows. It was the worst day for the blue chip index since it crashed 22 percent in October 1987. The S&P 500 fell 9.5 percent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.4 percent. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.55 percent. Stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange was briefly halted for the second time this week when, minutes after opening, the S&P fell below the 7 percent threshold that triggers market circuit-breakers. Overnight, futures hit trading curbs for the second time when they indicated a 5 percent decline from the previous close. The Federal Reserve announced a massive intervention, promising to inject an additional $1.5 billion into the repo market this week, bringing its total repo operations up to $1.62 trillion for the week. The Fed also said it would continue to inject liquidity into the market at that elevated level every week for the remainder of the month. That proved inadequate to reassure markets, however. Many investors think direct fiscal intervention is necessary to support the economy but worry that political fighting in Washington, D.C. may lead to an ineffective or overly delayed response from the federal government. President Donald Trump proposed a package of economic measures Wednesday night but indicated that he had not yet won support for them from Capitol Hill lawmakers. Many investors worry that even the president’s package, which included $50 billion of aid to small businesses and payroll tax relief, may stall out on Capitol Hill or may not be enough to prevent an economic meltdown. Democrats proposed their own package–but this was quickly criticized by both President Donald Trump and some Republican lawmakers. Investors were battered by bad news about the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday night and Thursday. The NBA said it was suspending the season, Major League Baseball suspended spring training and said it would delay opening-day, museums around the country announced they would close, and New York said it would ban gatherings of more than 500 people.  ",Stocks Collapse in Worst Day for Dow Since Crash of 1987,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/12/stocks-collapse-in-worst-day-for-dow-since-crash-of-1987/,Breitbart
"Members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) introduced a bipartisan bill to ban all imports from western Xinjiang, China, on Wednesday, asserting it is impossible to keep items manufactured by Muslim slaves out of America otherwise. The Chinese Communist Party has built hundreds of concentration camps in Xinjiang, its largest and westernmost province, in the past two years to imprison the region’s Muslims, the vast majority of which are members of the ethnic Uyghur majority indigenous to the region. China claims these camps are “vocational training centers” used to help unskilled Uyghurs develop talents that match jobs in the Chinese market. Uyghur survivors of the camps say they are used to kill, rape, torture, indoctrinate, and enslave them. Satellite images of the camps show that many are equipped with factories, where survivors say they are forced to work arduous hours manufacturing goods the Chinese government profits from for little to no money. Chinese officials claimed that the Uyghurs enslaved in the camps had all “graduated” from “vocational training” in December. This month, a study by an Australian think tank revealed that “graduation” meant that large numbers of the estimated 1 million to 3 million imprisoned Uyghurs had been transferred nationwide by force to fill labor gaps in factories in other parts of the country. The study found that 83 internationally operating companies – including American companies like Nike, Apple, and Gap – used factories featuring Uyghur slaves to manufacture products or components for products. Introduced alongside the legislation, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the CECC published a report detailing the extent of the use of Uyghur slave labor in China and how difficult it is for a company to verify that the products they import from China were not built by slaves. The report accuses China of crimes against humanity, an international crime that any court in the world has jurisdiction to prosecute, and urges Congress to block all imports with ties to Xinjiang. “The severe human rights abuses, torture, political indoctrination, forced renunciations of faith, and widespread and systematic forced labor occurring in mass internment camps may constitute crimes against humanity under international law,” the report concluded. “As this report details, forced labor exists both within the XUAR’s [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region] system of mass internment camps, and throughout the region, and is confirmed by the testimony of former camp detainees, satellite imagery, and recently leaked Chinese government documents.” The report listed carpets, cell phones, noodles, shoes, tea, and all sorts of clothing, housewares, and electronics among the products that China is forcing imprisoned Uyghurs to manufacture in captivity, while also being forced to endure communist indoctrination, abandon the principles of their Muslim faith, and learn Mandarin, a language that is not native to Xinjiang. Among the companies the commission concludes to be benefitting from this labor are Coca-Cola, Nike, Kraft Heinz, and Campbell Soup. The report clearly states, “due diligence in Xinjiang is not possible.” The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act addresses the results of the report by banning all imports from Xinjiang unless a company can clearly prove that the products were not made by slaves. The burden of proof falls on the person or company trying to import an item from Xinjiang to offer “clear and convincing evidence” that the imports “were not produced wholly or in part by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions.” The bill enjoys bipartisan support from the heads of the CECC. In the House of Representatives, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) will introduce the bill alongside 11 other Congressmen of both parties. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) will introduce the Senate version of the bill, along supported by a bipartisan group of nine senators. “Any U.S. or international company with operations in Xinjiang or working with the Xinjiang government to source labor to other parts of China should reconsider whether they want to be producing products under the aegis of a regional government that is committing “crimes against humanity,” Rep. McGovern said in a statement to the press. “It is long past time for companies to reassess their operations and supply chains in Xinjiang and find alternatives that do not exploit and violate individuals’ human rights.” Rubio similarly asserted that “companies have a moral duty and responsibility to prove that their sourced products have been produced without forced labor.” If passed, the bill will likely significantly curb the import of goods made by Uyghur forced labor. The CECC has heard expert testimony that some of these goods have already made it into America, in particular baby clothing sold at Costco manufactured in Xinjiang. As the bill is limited to Xinjiang, it will not address slave labor in other states bolstered by the mass transfer of imprisoned Uyghurs to replace workers in factories shut down by the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI)’s report published last week indicated that companies manufacturing for Nintendo, Sony, Google, Lacoste, and a total of 83 international companies were being kept open in part by replacing the Han Chinese workers that typically work there with Uyghurs. The Chinese Communist Party, the report revealed, has implemented government programs to encourage companies to “hire” Uyghur slaves at reduced prices, offering tax breaks for using Uyghur labor. “The Chinese government has facilitated the mass transfer of Uyghur and other ethnic minority citizens from the far west region of Xinjiang to factories across the country,” ASPI revealed. “Under conditions that strongly suggest forced labour, Uyghurs are working in factories that are in the supply chains of at least 83 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony and Volkswagen.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",Congress Introduces Bill to Stop Imports of Chinese Goods Made by Muslim Slaves,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/12/congress-introduces-bill-stop-imports-chinese-goods-made-muslim-slaves/,Breitbart

The survey, taken March 6-8, 2020, among 2,480 likely Florida Democrat primary voters, shows Joe Biden (D) dominating the Vermont senator in the Sunshine State. Now that Michael Bloomberg (D), who at one point led in Florida, is out of the race, Biden leads Sanders by a massive 55 points: #Florida @StPetePolls/@Fla_Pol Poll (3/6-8):Biden 69%Sanders 14%Bloomberg 5%Buttigieg 2%Warren 1%Klobuchar 1%Steyer 0% — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) March 12, 2020  The margin of error is +/- two percent. Notably, Sanders comes in with just 14 percent — one point below the 15 percent threshold required to obtain delegates from the delegate-rich state offering 219 delegates total: Florida has 219 delegates at stake in the primary. Of those, 76 will be given out based on the statewide vote, but only to candidates who crack the 15% threshold. Other delegates will be awarded based on performance within Congressional districts. The St Pete Polls survey found Sanders performing better in college towns like Gainesville and Tallahassee than statewide, with the underdog winning 23% or greater support in those markets, so it’s unlikely he leaves Florida empty-handed. Three other states — Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona — will vote on March 17 and offer 155, 136, and 67 delegates, respectively. If Sanders fails to reach the delegate threshold in Florida, it will boost Biden’s delegate lead and further dwindle Sanders’ presidential aspirations. A candidate needs 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. The self-described socialist senator took electoral hits on Super Tuesday, as Biden swept the south. The March 10 primaries, or “Mini Super Tuesday,” also did not work in Sanders’ favor, as he lost the biggest prize of the night, Michigan, to Biden by over 16 percentage points.",Poll Shows Bernie Sanders Missing Delegate Threshold in Florida,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/poll-shows-bernie-sanders-missing-delegate-threshold-in-florida/,Breitbart
"The Czech Republic has followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s lead and banned the entry of foreigners from 13 countries that are considered high-risk coronavirus territories, including the United Kingdom, and has restricted borders with Austria and Germany. Foreigners will not be able to enter the central European country who originate from China, South Korea, of Iran, but also those from the EU’s Italy, Sweden, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and France. Travellers from the UK and Switzerland are also banned. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced the measures on Thursday afternoon in the wake of President Trump banning travellers from 26 European Schengen Zone members from entering the United States for 30 days. The Czech Republic itself is one of the banned countries. The nation also made the unusual move of barring their citizens from travel to those high-risk territories. The measures will be put in place from Saturday and will last for 30 days. Movement from Austria and Germany will also be restricted, with travel between the countries only permissible via 11 border crossings, Radio Prague reports, and foreigners will not be able to enter the Czech territory from either Germany or Austria. Czechs currently overseas will be able to return home, but those coming from high-risk countries will be automatically placed in quarantine. The Interior Ministry will also stop issuing all visas until further notice, the report adds. ‘The EU Disapproves’: Brussels Angry Trump Acted on Coronavirus Without Their Permission https://t.co/2pjuQan6cD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 12, 2020  The Czech prime minister announced restrictions on public gatherings, with pubs and restaurants closing by 8 pm and serving food at shopping malls will also be banned. Libraries, galleries, and sporting facilities will also be closed. Public gatherings of more than 30 people will be prohibited. Police will be deployed to ensure that those ordered to self-isolate do so and do not risk infecting the rest of the population. Prime Minister Babiš said in comments reported by Reuters: “It is clear there will be economic impacts. But now we have to do everything for the virus not to spread, to avoid having it here without control.” “If we see the measures do not have sufficient effect, we will take more,” he added. To date, there have been 96 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Czech Republic but no fatalities. Led by the populist Babiš, once dubbed the Czech Trump, the Czech Republic is the only European Union country to have banned entry of travellers from multiple high-risk countries on such a scale. President Trump had announced his travel ban on Wednesday and criticised the EU for its response to the pandemic. He said: “The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots… As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.” The European Union has criticised President Trump for his decision to prioritise the health of the American people, with a statement from the European Commission expressing that the bloc “disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation”.

"President Trump has suspended all travel from mainland Europe. If this sounds excessive you clearly haven’t been paying attention to just how bad things have got with the coronavirus in parts of the continent. Northern Italy, especially, is experiencing horrors more redolent of a Medieval plague than of an advanced economy in the 21st century. This thread, reportedly from a doctor working in an Accident and Emergency department in a Northern Italian hospital, gives a grim taste: The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all. Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19, they are running 200% capacity We’ve stopped all routine, all ORs have been converted to ITUs and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. There are hundreds of pts with severe resp failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask. Patients above 65 or younger with comorbidities are not even assessed by ITU, I am not saying not tubed, I’m saying not assessed and no ITU staff attends when they arrest. Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed. In other words, many of Italy’s hospitals are overwhelmed. Every day they are having to make terrible Sophie’s Choice style decisions about which patients to save and which ones should be condemned to death — because they simply don’t have enough staff or equipment to keep them all alive. Unless Trump takes drastic action — presuming it isn’t already too late — then this is the fate that awaits America too. That’s why he was absolutely right to act in this dramatic way and for at least two good reasons. First, political: it’s imperative — especially for those of us who believe that a second Trump term is America’s only hope — that by the year-end, when with luck the pandemic will have passed or at least diminished, President Trump emerges as a man who handled this crisis decisively and effectively. It would be just too awful if, despite his many achievements, Trump ended up handing the election to Joe Biden because of a public perception that he’d been dilatory in protecting America from the 21st century’s answer to the Black Death. Second, geopolitical: Trump is right to shut off continental Europe because — in plague terms — it is the equivalent of one of those diseased carcasses that besieging armies used to fling with their ballistas over the city walls. This is a consequence of its open borders policy. Under the European Union’s Schengen Agreement — one of the bloc’s defining features and by their own reckoning, greatest achievement — there is almost complete freedom of movement across national borders. Which means that everyone from gun- and drug-smugglers to terrorists to coronavirus victims can travel from one end of the continent to the other, with individual states virtually powerless to protect their own borders or citizens. Consider Italy. Why is the situation so particularly bad there? Partly it may be cultural: more observant Catholics taking Holy Communion; elderly living cheek-by-jowl with the young; constant social kissing. But perhaps the best explanation so far is this one from David Vance: Many Italians in Northern Italy sold their leather goods and textiles companies to China. Italy then allowed 100,000 Chinese from Wuhan/Wenzhou to move to Italy to work in these factories, with direct Wuhan flights. Result: Northern Italy is Europe’s hotspot for Wuhan Coronavirus pic.twitter.com/eKZ0T59cUY — David Vance (@DVATW) March 12, 2020  He elaborates on his theory here: The murky reality is that the EU turned a blind eye to vast numbers of illegal Chinese immigrants working in Italian factories. The ‘Open Borders’ EU will of course try to keep this under wraps, but reality is, the Chinese Mafia operate Italian textile factories with tens of thousands of illegal immigrants shipping ‘made in Italy’ goods into China and elsewhere. Why didn’t the EU act to stop corrupt Italians taking backhanders from the Chinese mafia? And, of course, thanks to open borders, what is Italy’s problem today will be the problem of neighbours like Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and France tomorrow. Trump understands better than most politicians just what a corrupt, inefficient, porous entity the European Union is — which is why he was so keen for his friends in the United Kingdom to leave it. Europe — as a continent of great individual nations which formed the bedrock of Western Civilisation — is, of course, a magnificent place. But the European Union has gone a long way towards ruining it; certainly, it has rendered it unsafe in the current pandemic. Its open borders policy may be one reason why mainland European countries appear to have disproportionately more coronavirus infection cases than Britain or Ireland — both of which have more control over their borders, thanks to their being surrounded by sea. And we haven’t even got onto the menace posed by the four million or so migrants currently massing on Turkey’s borders with Greece, all of whom are an accelerated viral outbreak just waiting to happen. This is why President Trump has acted wisely in shutting the gates to plague pit Europe. It’s very harsh and there may be economic damage. But in times of crisis as bad as this, quick, tough action now may help prevent a heap of misery later.",Delingpole: Trump Was Right to Shut the Gates on Plague Pit Europe,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/12/delingpole-trump-was-right-to-shut-the-gates-on-plague-pit-europe/,Breitbart
"Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) announced on Thursday that he will self-quarantine after he was exposed to a Brazilian diplomat who tested positive for coronavirus. Scott said that he is feeling healthy and that the risk of him contracting coronavirus is low. However, he will self-quarantine out of concern for public safety. He said in a statement on Thursday: My office was alerted today by the Brazilian Embassy that a member of President Bolsonaro’s delegation tested positive for Coronavirus. On Monday, I met with the President in Miami, and while I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me. The Embassy said the person had no symptoms leading up to or the day of the conference. After consulting with the Senate’s attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don’t need to take a test or quarantine. However, the health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine in an abundance of caution. I am feeling healthy and not experiencing any symptoms at this time. I will still be working on my plan to combat Coronavirus and protect American families, and my offices in D.C. and throughout the state will still be fully operational to help Floridians. Scott’s announcement follows after he canceled a press conference in which he planned to announce his legislation to expand access to coronavirus testing. The Florida conservative’s bill would direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reimburse states that set up and run as many mobile testing sites as possible. Scott’s prepared remarks for Thursday emphasized that increased access to coronavirus testing is the “number one issue right now.” He said: People who need and want to be tested are being turned away. In the nation with the best and most developed health care system in the world, that is absolutely ridiculous. We need to look at what has worked and failed in other countries to address the emerging threat posed by the Coronavirus. Mobile testing is one of the successful ideas we are seeing. It has been used in South Korea and Australia. Some states like Colorado, Connecticut, and Washington are starting to use this method. At these mobile testing sites, people can drive up and get tested at a window.  Just like a fast food restaurant. Not only can more people get tested, it keeps health care workers safer. People need to have access to tests so they can make better decisions about isolating themselves. And, we have to keep our health care workers healthy. We must reduce exposure of health care workers NOW. Testing for the virus is happening in the most haphazard way. And what happens if a large population of our health care workers get exposed?  Who will care for the ill? This is something we cannot waste another day not fixing. If you look at reports, South Korea has been able to fight this virus by expanding testing.  It has been reported that 15,000 people a day are getting tested and 210,000 South Koreans have been tested since Jan. 3, compared to about 6,500 tests completed in the US as of this week. Reports show the fatality rate in South Korea is 0.7%, globally it is 3.4%.  We can learn from these successes and mirror this approach right here in the United States. We need to get ahead of this crisis. Scott also called for shutting down American borders, schools, and government buildings to limit the transmission of coronavirus. “We must always hope for the best but prepare for the worst. We are all in this together. We need to take care of each other,” Scott concluded in his prepared remarks. “We are going to get through this, but we all have to our own part.  And, if you know someone who may need help, call them. Check on them. Let’s watch out for each other.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said Thursday that the worldwide coronavirus pandemic death rate might exceed the deaths directly caused by World War II, which are estimated to be 50–56 million people. In an attempt to blame the virus spread on President Donald Trump, Sanders said, “We have an administration that is largely incompetent and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in our country.” Sanders said, “Cases of coronavirus continues to grow exponentially here in the United States and around the world, and we have witnessed a global economic meltdown which will impact millions of workers in our own country. In the terms of potential deaths, in terms of the economic impact on our economy, the crisis we face from the coronavirus is on the scale of major war, and we must act accordingly. Nobody knows what the number of fatalities may end up being, or the number of people who may get ill and we all hope that that number will be as low as possible, but we also have to face the truth and that is that the number of casualties may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II.” He continued, “If our neighbor or co-worker gets sick, we have the potential to become sick. If our neighbor loses his or her job, then our local community suffers, and we may lose our job. We’re in this together. If doctors and nurses and medical personnel do not have the equipment and the training and the capacity they need right now, people may unnecessarily face additional illness and even death.

"President Donald Trump is leading former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.

The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll shows President Trump tops Biden, the Democrat presidential primary frontrunner, 51 percent to 41 percent in support among likely voters. Eight percent of the poll’s respondents said they are undecided. Sanders trails the president 41 percent to 53 percent, while six percent are unsure about the potential match-up. The figures also show President Trump has hit 50 percent approval among Iowans, marking his highest rating in the poll. “That is a high-water mark in the Iowa Poll,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer. “There are some things about the man, personally, I don’t care for, but policy, yes,” independent voter Steve Jorgensen told the Des Moines Register of President Trump. “His trade policies — particularly for the farmers — I think in the long run are going to turn out great.

"On Thursday, Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden named former Beto O’Rourke campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon as the new manager to head the Biden campaign. O’Rourke ran on a gun control platform while Dillon was managing his campaign and Biden made clear O’Rourke will “be the one who leads” on gun control in a Biden administration. The Washington Post describes Dillon as having “deep ties across the [Democrat] Party.” She served as Barack Obama’s deputy campaign manager in 2012, and worked to “create a new non-profit date exchange” for Democrats in 2019. Dillon volunteered with the Biden campaign prior to becoming campaign manager. Her volunteer efforts began after O’Rourke ended his own presidential campaign. Biden and O’Rourke share very similar views on gun control, with both men supporting a government buyback of “assault weapons.” O’Rourke began pushing said buybacks in September 2019 and Biden, too, pushed taxpayer-funded, government mandated buybacks of certain firearms. On November 7, 2019, Breitbart News reported Biden saying: Folks, look, and I would buy back [assault] weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said on Thursday that lawmakers should consider a swath of measures, including “no-strings” universal basic income (UBI) programs, as a response to the economic impacts of the Chinese coronavirus. The freshman lawmaker weighed in on the ongoing debate over an economic relief package designed to combat the ramifications of the coronavirus. She said while proposals, like expanding unemployment insurance, are good, they are not enough and pushed for far more drastic, big-government measures. “There are enormous sectors of our economy (tipped workers, freelance, shift workers) who may not be ‘unemployed’ but whose lives are still dramatically disrupted to the point of eviction, etc,” she said, suggesting a handful of proposals including extending Medicare and Medicaid coverage to all, freezing evictions, eliminating work requirements for assistance programs, and offering “no-strings” UBI programs: Some are taking about ⬆️unemployment insurance, & while good it’s not nearly enough.

While the bill includes basics like free coronavirus testing, Republicans contend that their colleagues added elements that are unnecessary and ineffective while ignoring other solutions, like a payroll tax cut — a proposal House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) called a “non-starter.” The Democrats’ package includes the expansion of food assistance programs and an emergency paid leave program. “There’s a couple major problems with it. Here’s one glaring problem, under Pelosi’s bill the Social Security Administration will be set up to administer the paid sick leave program,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said on Thursday, adding that it will take six months and therefore not work in time. “It will also hamper the administration from putting out Social Security for those who need it right now that are in harm’s way,” he continued. “This will hurt the very population, it’s supposed to be helping,” he added. “It forces permanent paid sick leave for all businesses without exemptions and no sunsets.” He added that there are “a few ideas that I think that we have brought to the table that can help — employee retention credit, making public health emergencies eligible for major disaster programs” and reiterated that Republicans stand ready to strike a bipartisan deal.

President Trump delivered an Oval Office address to the nation about his administration’s efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The president announced that the United States would bar travel from European countries for 30 days beginning at midnight on Friday. 
“After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans,” he stated. “These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.” Trump said he is also instructing the Small Business Administration to provide low-interest loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus and asking Congress to increase funding for this program by $50 million and provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. The briefing came after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced 31 Americans have died from the COVID-19 outbreak and more than 1,000 have been sickened. Trump warned that the highest risk remains among the elderly population with underlying health conditions and strongly advised nursing homes for the elderly to suspend all medically unnecessary visits and encouraged older people to avoid unnecessary travel. “Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,” Trump said.

"Democrat Rep. Donna Shalala (D-FL) briefly blasted “Fight Song” on her phone during her time to speak on H.R. 6201, the Democrats’ coronavirus economic relief proposal, at a House Rules Committee meeting on Wednesday night. Lawmakers on Wednesday discussed the Democrats’ emergency relief proposal purportedly designed to combat negative economic impacts related to Chinese coronavirus. Shalala, who served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services during former President Bill Clinton’s administration, briefly blasted “Fight Song” — which further rose to popularity after serving as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign song — on her phone before defending the package. “I think it’s a mental health bill,” she said after turning the song off, describing the bill as a means to “reassure and reduce the anxiety and the fear that’s out there in this country.” She argued in favor of the Democrats’ proposal, contending that their colleagues who crafted the bill simply built on existing programs. “And if you look at what our distinguished members did in this bill, they went into their toolbox,” she explained. “They took existing programs that we’ve had hearing after hearing on over the last decade and focused those programs on this particular virus and this set of fears in our communities,” she continued. The package, for example, provides emergency food stamp assistance and suspends work requirements. It also lays out an emergency paid leave benefits program. The Trump administration has pushed for a payroll tax cut, but Democrats have dismissed the idea. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) bluntly called it a “non-starter.” Shalala said the bill will “reassure” families that they have a support network stemming from the federal government, which will help ease fears. “There is nothing really new in this package except that it’s focused very carefully on supporting families that are scared to death about this virus,” she said. “And I think that it goes a long way to reduce anxiety and fear in our communities.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said on Thursday that Republicans will not support the Democrats’ bill because it “comes up short” and remains “off-base.” “There’s a couple major problems with it. Here’s one glaring problem, under Pelosi’s bill, the Social Security Administration will be set up to administer the paid sick leave program. Now this will take more than six months, so it won’t work in time,” McCarthy said. “It will also hamper the administration from putting out Social Security for those who need it right now that are in harm’s way,” he added. “Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi’s first draft from late last night was off-base. It does not focus immediate relief on affected Americans,” he continued, contending that it only “proposes new bureaucracy that would only delay assistance.” “It wanders into policy areas that are not related to the pressing issues at hand,” he noted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also described the Democrats’ proposal as “off-base”: Fortunately, we do not need to choose between Speaker Pelosi’s first draft and doing nothing. I am glad the Administration is continuing talks. The Senate is ready to consider a bipartisan, bicameral package if House Democrats return to the table & work with the President's team. — Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) March 12, 2020  Negotiations are still underway.",Watch: Democrat Lawmaker Blasts Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Tune ‘Fight Song’ During Meeting on Coronavirus Bill,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/watch-democrat-lawmaker-blasts-hillary-clintons-campaign-tune-fight-song-during-meeting-on-coronavirus-bill/,Breitbart
"Former Tonight Show host and comedian Jay Leno says he is backing Joe Biden for president because he is a “decent man.” “People like Joe because he’s got a good character,” Leno said according to The Hill. Jay Leno added that Biden’s big comeback win on Super Tuesday was a “feel good” moment. “It was like the end of ‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’ Remember George Bailey? He was down and out and everybody shows up with money,” Leno insisted. The former TV talk show host said he was amazed at how Biden came roaring back even to beat billionaire Michael Bloomberg. “He spent $11,000 in Massachusetts — that’s one ad, really — and he won. He beat Bloomberg. I mean, I like Michael Bloomberg, but it’s nice to know that $600 million can’t replace character,” he said. Leno, who retired from the Tonight Show in 2014, added that he enjoys being a “news junkie” but insists that he doesn’t “have to pay attention to it.” He also joked that the more things change, the more they stay the same. “The news doesn’t change that much,” Leno said. “If you miss it for a day, you miss everything. If you miss it for a year, you don’t miss anything.” Still, Leno did lament the way the news is covered today. “The news, it’s the same topic every night. It used to be different topics,” he said. “Now it’s just, ‘What outrageous thing did X say this time?'” Leno has often been cited as a somewhat conservative comic but the comedian has noted that he is not a conservative voter. “I’m not conservative. I’ve never voted that way in my life,” he said in 2009.

"The coronavirus outbreak presents a “moment of reckoning” for the United States in reevaluating its approach towards China, assessed Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) during an interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily. Marlow noted the myriad of political issues related to viral outbreak, from national immigration, industrial, and manufacturing policies. He highlighted America’s dependence on Chinese exports of generic and over-the-counter drugs. “We are now largely dependent on China having outsourced so much of our pharmaceutical manufacturing for basic pharmaceutical ingredients, like Tylenol or Advil,” Cotton stated. “They feel empowered to threaten our people if we hurt their feelings, if we extend the travel ban. So we have to have the immediate response to the Wuhan coronavirus, but this is a moment of reckoning in which we will have a far-reaching reevaluation of our relationship with China.” LISTEN: 
China could effectively shut down America’s healthcare system within months given the one-party state’s “global chokehold” on the manufacturing of medicines and medical supplies, explained Rosemary Gibson, author of China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America’s Dependence on China for Medicine, to Breitbart News in February. Attitudes towards China among politicians, particularly Republicans, are changing as a result of President Donald Trump, determined Cotton. “I can tell you that increasingly people are now awake to this threat [from China],” Cotton remarked. “President Trump has done very good job with, frankly, Republicans in Washington over the last four years to make them think a little bit less like corporate managers a little bit more like American patriots first. We made a lot of wrong turns with China over the last 30 years. Now’s the time to fix that, and it’s time to fix it urgently.” Cotton considered calibrating federal government policy to promote domestic production of medicines towards lessening U.S. dependence on Chinese pharmaceutical exports. “f you are engaged, for instance, in manufacturing basic pharmaceutical ingredients in China, I suggest to you that you need to pack up and get out, and if you don’t do it quickly, then the U.S. government may do it for you,” Cotton stated. Asked by Marlow about Congress’s next moves in addressing the coronavirus threat, Cotton replied, “One thing I’m working on particularly is trying to get Deb Fischer’s legislation that would provide many more masks for our healthcare professionals across the finish line this week. This bill should have passed last week as part of our supplemental bill.” Democrats are prioritizing trial lawyers over health and safety for healthcare professionals, Cotton said. “Sen. Fisher has been working on it from the very beginning when we learned that we might face a mask shortage in this country as early as late April, [and] unfortunately the Democrats objected,” Cotton stated. “They put the request of ambulance-chasing trial lawyers to have jackpot justice lawsuits down the road ahead of the safety of our great doctors and nurses.” Cotton warned that Democrats may seek to include irrelevant spending within coronavirus-related emergency funding legislation. Cotton continued, “I hope we get that passed today, whether it’s part of a bigger package, which would be harder to pass or if the Democrats would simply just relent and let it pass by voice vote, because it would be unanimous or near unanimous if we did that. That’s the most immediate thing on which I’m working, because we cannot — whatever happens — we cannot create more doctors and nurses. We can create more test kits. We can create new quarantine sites. We cannot create a new doctor and nurse, and if they don’t have the masks they need to protect themselves as they’re caring for our people, it will be a travesty, and it will be because Democrats put trial lawyers ahead of doctors.” Marlow invited Cotton’s comments on Joe Biden’s vision of China. “Joe Biden, as Robert Gates said, has been wrong on every major foreign policy question of the last 40 years,” replied Cotton. “You actually have to update that to, say, 50 years now? Because he still doesn’t believe that China is a competitor of ours. He still calls the Chinese Communist Party ‘good folks.’” The coronavirus outbreak “is a feature, not a bug” of communism, declared Cotton, recalling the Chinese Communist Party’s conduct. “What we see with the Wuhan coronavirus, it’s not a bug. It is a feature of Communist Party rule,” Cotton said. “If the Chinese Communist Party had simply been open and transparent in early December, if they acknowledged they had a problem, if they had asked for support from the World Health Organization and world-class scientists, not just from the United States but from countries like South Korea and Japan and the countries of Europe, we might have been able to contain this inside of Wuhan, inside of Hubei province. But no, they acted like communists. They suppressed information. They visited people in the middle of the night who tried to blow the whistle on this virus, and now look where we are.” Cotton concluded, “Joe Biden [is] very, very weak on China, a defining issue for our times,” adding, “Joe Biden has been on China’s side for 40 years, not on your side.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

"During a Friday interview on “Fox & Friends,”  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, discussed COVID-19 and its spread in the United States. With some from China suggesting the coronavirus was a weapon devised by the U.S. military and deployed in Wuhan and Democrats claiming that saying the disease originated in China is xenophobic, Fauci said “there’s no doubt” it came from China. “It absolutely came from Wuhan,” Fauci stated. “There’s no doubt about that.” In the interview, Fauci also called for people to “socially distance” themselves to help prevent the spread of the virus. “The situation is different in Seattle, in Washington, because they’ve had the unfortunate situation of having community spread there. Also, in certain areas of California. That’s a bit different than other areas in which there still will ultimately be infection but not exactly the way it is right now,” Fauci advised. “So, you want to be proportionate in what you do, but for sure, you don’t want to do nothing. You want to start doing something to socially distance yourself. How dramatic that is, closing schools and doing other things, should be proportionate. A lot of people, a lot of sections are doing it anyway. I don’t criticize them for that.

Federally Funded Unemployment Benefits to provide your workers with a safety net in case of furloughs. A Payroll Tax Holiday for employers with fewer than 100 employees to reduce your cost of employment and avoid layoffs. “As our nation works together to fight through the health and economic impact of the coronavirus, Congress needs to step up the focus on small business,” said JCN President and CEO Alfredo Ortiz. “Small business is the engine of the American economy and is too big to fail.” “The President understands this, and now it is up to Congress to act immediately – even cancel its recess next week if necessary – and get to work passing a series of policy solutions that will help small businesses fight off this pandemic,” Ortiz continued. “Congress needs to pass a payroll tax holiday for small businesses with 100 or fewer employees that will help both workers and employers.” Ortiz also called on members of Congress to “put down their partisan swords” and work in a more “bipartisan effort.” “Members of Congress need to put down their partisan swords and work to pass these initiatives immediately to maintain the financial health of small businesses and their employees,” Ortiz added. “We have done this in the past in a bipartisan effort.

"Dr. Nicole Saphier told Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that the reason the U.S. had rejected coronavirus test kits from abroad is that they had a 48% false negative rate, meaning sick people would believe, falsely, they were fine. Saphier is a former microbiologist who appears frequently on Fox News as a contributor. She is also the author of Make America Healthy Again: How Bad Behavior and Big Government Caused a Trillion-Dollar Crisis. Saphier generally praised the U.S. response to coronavirus, but said that “the one thing” that was “unacceptable” was the lack of testing kits, noting that the private sector had not been harnessed. She noted that President Donald Trump had acted early by imposing a travel ban on China. “That was the right thing to do,” she said. “What didn’t happen was the mass testing of people in the United States,” she added. “And a part of this was the United States rejected some of these testing kits from elsewhere, and that is because the United States placed high standards on what we use in our health care system. Things have to go through FDA approval. “Although President Trump has lifted many of these restrictions, it is still a process. We want to make sure things are safe, or they’re accurate. And the truth is, the testing kits being used in China — they were reporting up to a 48% false negative rate. So if you got a negative test result, that didn’t actually mean that they didn’t have the virus.”  The U.S., she noted, developed its own test, but was also “found to be faulty” once it was distributed. “This is not so simple as just a yes-or-no answer … it’s very complicated,” she said, noting that some of the criticism was “a little unfair.” She said, given the urgency, that the U.S. should have used even faulty tests at the start, because they would at least have caught some of the positive cases. Dr. Saphier noted that South Korea had been successful at testing because of mass production of testing kits by private biotech companies. Joel B.

It is with deep regret that, following @EquityUK’s statement this morning, all members of Equity’s recently renamed Race Equality Committee (formerly the Equity Minority Ethnic Members Committee) feel we have no choice but to resign as committee members. — Equity Race Equality Committee (@EquityREC) March 13, 2020  The regret, I’m sure, is not shared by the rest of the world. Let’s just remind ourselves briefly of the background. Fox — a likeable, interesting and very talented actor, probably best known for playing DS Hathaway in Lewis — acquired instant public notoriety when he appeared on the BBC political panel show Question Time. His remarks on the show were perfectly unexceptionable. He ventured, for example, that the Duchess of Sussex — aka Princess Meghan — was not a victim of racism. As the Daily Mail reminds us, he said: ‘It’s not racism … we’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe. It’s so easy to throw the charge of racism and it’s really starting to get boring now.’ The audience member then described Fox as a “white, privileged male”, to which he responded: ‘To call me a white, privileged male is to be racist.’ But the Social Justice Warriors wanted blood. Actors are expected to be fully on board with the identity politics/cultural Marxist agenda: any deviation therefrom must be punished. So a campaign was launched by the usual suspects to get Fox for the crime of having original political opinions. What didn’t help was that in the course of an interview on my podcast the Delingpod, Fox had expressed some measured, cautious reservations about the incongruous ‘diversity’ casting in Sam Mendes’s World War One movie 1917. Fox said and did nothing wrong, as I explained at the time, in detail, in my piece Laurence Fox Vs the Diversity Gestapo. Nevertheless, his remarks were seized on by left-wing activists as a sign that Fox was a borderline racist. Among those that jumped on the bandwagon was the actors’ union Equity which branded Fox a ‘disgrace to our industry’. Fox responded unapologetically and robustly: This is the position I took last night and I live by in life. If you can improve on it, I’m all ears.  Or you can keep screeching “Racist!” at me and I can carry on having a jolly good giggle at your expense. The tide is turning. pic.twitter.com/fFJzkzvFsY — Laurence Fox  (@LozzaFox) January 17, 2020  Many actors in Fox’s position would have done the usual thing in the face of Equity’s bullying — and backed down. After all, acting is Fox’s livelihood and when your own industry gangs up and conspires to try to make you into an unemployable non-person what option do you have other than to eat crow? Well, fantastic Mr Fox has shown us that there is another way. Equity has been exposed as illiberal and libellous. The minority of race-baiters from within the Union — Equity’s self-styled Race Equality Committee — have had their wings clipped. If only more of us were prepared to take a brave, principled stand against the forces of woke, as Fox has done, the world would be a much more agreeable place. Here is one of the instigators of Equity’s attack on Fox. I've resigned as @EquityREC Chair over this. @Equity and La*rence F*x can issue as many joint statements and apologies as they like.

If your answer, as I suspect, is Laurence Fox, then here is the question we should all be asking: how in God’s name did nonentities like Daniel York Loh ever manage to acquire such power that they were able to cancel — or attempt to cancel — the careers of genuine talents like Fox?

"The border between Greece and Turkey is becoming increasingly militarised, with heavily armed personnel from either side continuing to pour into the region as illegal migrants seek to punch through the European Union’s common external border with Turkish president’s blessing. Greece is well-accustomed to having its airspace and territorial waters violated hundreds or even thousands of times a year by its much larger neighbour — a NATO ally, on paper — which makes a number of claims on Greek islands and other border territories. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s decision to “open the gates” to Europe on his side of the frontier — and the Greek government’s decision to hold fast, in contrast to its stance in 2015 — has heightened tensions enormously, with the Turks accused of having an active role in transporting migrants to the border, co-ordinating their attempts to breach it, and even arming them with tear gas to attack Greek border forces. These have been heavily reinforced by the Greek armed forces, who the Turks, in turn, have accused of firing on and even killing migrants.

(Photo by ANGELOS TZORTZINIS/AFP via Getty Images) Turkish armed forces are extremely active in the region as well, facing down their Greek counterparts through border fencing and across the Evros river, as well as putting special forces patrol boats into the water. As the Turkish police have been accused of firing tear gas on Greek border guards to support attempts by migrants to break through — accusations seemingly supported by video evidence — so Turkish soldiers have now been accused of firing directly at the Greeks, greatly increasing the chances of a deadly incident on the embattled frontier.

Ylva Johansson, the European Commission responsible for migration, said of a meeting with the Greeks: “We are going to discuss actually what they are doing, but they have to let people apply for asylum.” The Swedish social democrat suggested that the Greek government was breaking EU law, regardless of its claims to have activated a clause in the EU treaties allowing it to bar migrants — “Individuals in the European Union have the right to apply for asylum. This is in the treaty, this is in international law. This we can’t suspend,” she said.

"I have just been blackpilled by Peter Hitchens. Blackpilled, as I’m sure you all know, is that stage of enlightenment beyond redpilled. Not only do you see the truth of things but what you go on to realise is that we are totally doomed: if there is any redemption, it can only be in the next world, not this one. Hitchens, Christian brother of the atheist Christopher, was talking with special reference to Boris Johnson’s Conservative party. I asked him why it is that on so many issues — giving Britain’s 5G contract to a hostile foreign power, going ahead with the expensive, futile and environmentally destructive HS2, the insanity of Net Zero, Keynesian deficit spending etc — Boris’s Conservatives have proved to be every bit as disappointing as the quite fantastically dismal Theresa May Conservatives and the spectacularly useless David Cameron Conservatives. The reason, Hitchens explained, is that the Conservative party isn’t Conservative and hasn’t been for some time. He didn’t use the phrase “it’s not a bug, it’s a feature” — that wouldn’t be Hitchens’s style — but it’s essentially what he means. “There are no Conservatives left,” he told me. “Or at least so few they can make no difference.” The rot set in the 1960s, Hitchens argues. From about this point, the Conservative party ceased to offer a meaningful alternative to the ideology of the left, but simply argued that it would handle Britain’s managed decline more efficiently. The Conservatives did not attempt, for example, to challenge one of the fundamental — and most damaging — tenets of the left’s ideology: egalitarianism. Instead, they accepted all the left’s shibboleths — that selective education, where pupils are set by ability, (eg grammar schools) was unfair; that the war on patriarchy is a good and necessary thing and that there must be more enforced equality in the workplace, even in careers to which women are largely unsuited such as the Army and the fire brigade. “But there has been no attempt to put women on dust carts,” notes Hitchens. Why haven’t conservatives put up more of a fuss about the left’s cultural takeover? Hitchens explains: The best way to revolutionise a country is by small increments. This, of course, is the slogan of Mátyás Rákosi, the hideous Hungarian communist leader. He called it ‘salami slicing.’ The idea being that you sliced away at the liberties and the wealth and the freedoms of civil society in tiny, thin slices – none of which was big enough to provoke organised opposition. But at the end of the process of slicing them there wasn’t any salami left. As a former Trotskyite revolutionary himself, Hitchens knows whereof he speaks. And he’s right. Most of us have a pretty strong idea of what a functioning Western democracy looks like. It has an Army that defends the realm rather than agitates about how best to get more women through the SAS selection test or how to make Muslims feel they can comfortably whip out a prayer mat while on exercise in the Brecons; it has a police force that stops burglaries and knife crime rather than paints its fingernails and BMWs in rainbow colours to show solidarity with LBGTQ issues; it has elite universities which polish the finest minds of a generation by exposure to the best that has ever been thought or written, rather than train them to be nasty, narrow-minded little Social Justice Warriors; and so on. What’s extraordinary is that a nation where — as the Brexit vote suggested — the majority of people are of at least a small-c conservative disposition, there was no serious pushback to any of this lunacy. Most culpable of all is the Conservative party itself. Instead of presenting a coherent opposition to the left’s social justice dogma, it actively embraced it. One of the key moments, Hitchens argues, was when Labour leader Tony Blair — who, Hitchens believes, remained a Trotskyite long after his student days — made a speech on the 2001 campaign trail effectively setting out the terms on which any future Conservative administration had to obey if it was ever to see power. David Cameron duly obliged by announcing himself as the Heir to Blair. The Conservatives never seriously attempted to counter the left’s constant suggestion that they were heartless, selfish, uncaring – the ‘Nasty Party’ as Theresa May once styled them. As Hitchens says: “Nobody ever responded by saying that actually there are humane and civilised arguments which can be made responsibly by intelligent people which suggest that [the left’s policies] are mechanisms which although they appear to be good have terrible effects and need to be resisted. It was never done. There was no development of a conservative thought process, no critique, no basis for a conservative long march through the institutions – because there are no conservatives.” I wish he were wrong. But you only need to look at Boris Johnson’s Conservatives, which are merely continuation John Major, David Cameron and Theresa May, to realise that Hitchens is absolutely right. The full Hitchens interview will be broadcast next Thursday on the Delingpod podcast.","Hitchens: Of Course Boris Will Disappoint, There Are No Conservatives Left in Britain",2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/13/hitchens-of-course-boris-will-disappoint-there-are-no-conservatives-left-in-britain/,Breitbart
"We now know the cost of impeachment. While Democrats were diverting the attention and energy of the entire country into a pointless trial that could not possibly have ended in anything other than President Donald Trump’s acquittal, the coronavirus pandemic was beginning in China and arriving in the United States. The timeline of the two developments — impeachment and coronavirus — is shocking, and reveals the true cost of hyper-partisanship. For twenty days, from the day the first death from coronavirus was known, Democrats did nothing about it. They were too busy with the president’s impeachment trial — a trial Pelosi had delayed unnecessarily for several weeks. To the extent that they commented on coronavirus at all, it was only to tear up the president’s remarks or to call him a racist. They told the nation that he, not coronavirus, was a threat to the national security of the United States. In the midst of that all-consuming trial, it is remarkable Trump was able to do anything else at all. But he did, and one of the things he did was impose the China travel ban, just one day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, and the day before the first victim of the pandemic died outside China. For his trouble, he was criticized by the World Health Organization and called “hysterical” by his future 2020 rival. When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them. Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner. But we know why. Joel B.

"Federal government bureaucracy has reportedly plagued some aspects of the coronavirus response, including the availability of tests and making it more difficult for private labs to conduct tests. That’s a problem Rep. Greg Murphy (R-NC) recognizes and hopes to overcome. During an interview with Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN on Thursday, Murphy called out the Food and Drug Administration and credited the Trump administration for making efforts cut down on regulations. “I think that has been a major problem,” he said. “CDC came out with tests first. They were not the correct tests. They had a lot of chemical problems. The FDA several years ago put a lot of handcuffs on labs and hospitals to what testing they could do. And that has stunted our response. I think the administration has been spot-on to cut down those regulations, and now testing is increasing markedly.” However, Murphy said in recognizing those difficulties, it could be a preview of what government-run health care would be like. “If anybody wants a notion of what government-run health care would look like, this is a perfect example of what regulation and government bureaucracy looks like,” Murphy added. “I think the administration is doing exactly what it can at this point in time to decrease the amount of regulatory burden and get these tests out.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",GOP Rep.

"The United States military conducted “defensive” airstrikes against five Kata’ib Hizbollah (KH) weapons storage facilities across Iraq, significantly degrading the Iran-backed Shia militia’s ability to conduct future attacks against coalition forces, the Pentagon said Thursday. “These strikes were defensive, proportional, and in direct response to the threat posed by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups (SMG) who continue to attack bases hosting [Operation Inherent Resolve] coalition forces,” the Pentagon said in a statement. A rocket attack on Camp Taji on Wednesday killed one U.K. and two U.S. service members and wounded 14 others. “The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement. “As we have demonstrated in recent months, we will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region.” The Pentagon discussed the protection of U.S. and coalition forces with senior Iraqi officials, according to the department. “A number of SMGs, including KH, have a strong linkage with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force and have repeatedly received lethal aid and other support from Iran that they have used to attack coalition forces,” the statement said. “These SMGs and their Iranian supporters must cease their attacks on U.S. and coalition forces or face consequences at a time and place of our choosing,” it said.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s proposal for combatting the coronavirus cribs heavily from actions the Trump administration has already taken against the pandemic. Biden, whom many believe has locked up the Democrat nomination, unveiled his plan in a televised address on Thursday. The speech, which was billed beforehand by supporters as commander-in-chief-worthy, heavily criticized President Donald Trump’s efforts to contain the pandemic. “Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the hollowing out of agencies and the disparagement of science,” Biden said. Adding that “our ability to derive a global response” was also “dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world.” Instead of urging unity and calm, Biden spent a large portion of the speech leveling political attacks on the president. Biden, in particular, argued that Trump’s policies and demeanor in the White House only exacerbated tensions in the public health and safety sectors. “Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,” the former vice president said. “Public fears are being compounded by [a] pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by an adversarial relationship with the truth.” Despite the tough rhetoric, many of the proposals Biden suggested for combatting the virus were, in fact, already central to the Trump administration’s efforts. For instance, Biden’s plan calls for “no efforts” to be spared in getting private laboratories and universities to help test for the virus. The suggestion mirrors a move the Trump administration took in February in ordering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow hundreds of academic hospitals and private laboratories to start testing for the coronavirus. Similarly, the former vice president’s plan argues in favor of a federal relief effort for small businesses negatively impacted by the pandemic. The idea is identical to one Trump, himself, proposed on Wednesday, while addressing the nation in primetime. Trump’s version, which has been presented to Congress in the form of a $50 billion appropriation for low-interest loans to small businesses, includes detailed requirements for cost, eligibility, and implementation. Biden’s proposal, on the other hand, is vague in terms of cost, only stating the former vice president would push for the creation of a small-business loan program upon taking office. Other core recommendations from Biden’s plan are indistinguishable from current Trump administration efforts. Specifically, the former vice president’s proposal calls for revising existing laws and regulations to ensure insurance companies waive co-pays and deductibles for coronavirus testing and “any eventual vaccine.” Although Biden’s plan has an elaborate mechanism for ensuring such payments are waived, it remains unclear if such an extensive structural change is needed. The question is especially uncertain after Trump announced on Wednesday that he had convinced insurance providers to commit to waiving the costs for coronavirus. Trump has also secured other important concessions, including the expansion of coverage for treatment across all insurance plans. While this means that an eventual vaccine for the virus would not necessarily be free, portions of the cost would likely be covered. Likewise, the former vice president’s pledge to “accelerate” the development of a vaccine is something the Trump administration has undertaken. In January, officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced they were fast-tracking the development of a coronavirus vaccine in anticipation of potential outbreak. At the time, health officials were hoping that a streamlined process would ensure the vaccine was ready for clinical trials by at least May. Biden’s proposal does not elaborate on how it would expedite the process any further, apart from stating the NIH “must be responsible for the clinical trial networks and work closely with the FDA on trial approvals.” The similarities between Biden’s proposal and what the current administration is already doing to combat the coronavirus did not escape notice on Thursday. “Joe Biden’s coronavirus remarks today sounded awfully familiar,” Andrew Clark, the Trump campaign’s rapid response director, said in an email to Breitbart News. “Listening to him, we felt a sense of déjà vu.” This is not the first time this election cycle the former vice president has attracted scrutiny for the similarities between his official proposals and other sources. In July 2019, Biden’s campaign released its policy for tackling climate change to much fanfare. Later it emerged, however, that some of the text and ideas presented had actually been borrowed, without attribution, from several high-profile climate change advocacy groups.",Biden’s Coronavirus Proposal Cribs Heavily from Trump Administration,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/12/bidens-coronavirus-proposal-cribs-heavily-from-trump-administration/,Breitbart

"On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” Rep. and former HHS Secretary Donna Shalala (D-FL) stated that President Trump is “undisciplined” and “dangerous to our health.” Shalala said, “Well, this president is dangerous to our health.

"A study under peer review at Princeton University has found that the novel coronavirus can, in fact, survive on its own “up to days” at a time. “Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days,” the abstract says: HCoV-19 (SARS-2) has caused >88,000 reported illnesses with a current case-fatality ratio of ~2%. Here, we investigate the stability of viable HCoV-19 on surfaces and in aerosols in comparison with SARS35 CoV-1. Overall, stability is very similar between HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1. We found that viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 2.7 hours. Both viruses show relatively long viability on stainless steel and polypropylene compared to copper or cardboard: the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 is around 13 hours on steel and around 16 hours on polypropylene. Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. In plain speech, the study, currently being reviewed by Princeton University, has found that the virus can survive floating in the air for up to three hours, and up to three days on both plastics and stainless steel. These findings mean that containment of the global pandemic known as the novel coronavirus, or, officially “COVID-19,” could be far more difficult than previously believed. The World Health Organization has stated that they are “deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction” in response to the contagion. As states across the nation begin to shut down public gatherings and issue health alerts, the federal government is struggling to find adequate measures to test victims and develop a vaccine.

"President Donald Trump suggested on Thursday at the White House that organizers postpone the Olympics for a year rather than cancel them outright because of the coronavirus. “This is just my idea: maybe they postpone it for a year,” Donald Trump theorized. “Maybe they do that if that’s possible.” The president floated the possibility of postponing the games after reporters at the White House asked him about his thoughts about the games during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. The 2020 Summer Olympic Games are scheduled to begin on July 24 in Tokyo, Japan, but it is unclear whether the games will continue as scheduled. Trump acknowledged that organizers probably would not hold the games without people attending. “I just can’t see having no people there,” he said. The president wished Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “good luck” going forward, praising his newly constructed venues for the unique opportunity. “They did such a perfect job. The venues are incredible,” Trump said, noting that he had seen pictures of the Olympic site in Tokyo. “They built it very well … and they’re beautiful facilities.” Estimates show that Japan would lose up to $75 million in revenue if the games are canceled.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden offered his own plan for the federal government’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, and it includes a call for more testing immediately. “The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of leadership, planning and execution. The White House should measure and report each day, each and every day, how many tests have been ordered, how many tests have been completed, and how many have tested positive. By next week the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands,” Biden said at the press conference where he announced his plan. (emphasis added) Biden did not specify how he would deal with the critical problem that has been identified as a barrier to making the tests more widely available: the shortage of key materials necessary to produce the tests combined with high demand for tests in other countries. Biden’s assertion that the number of Coronavirus (COVID-19) tests to be conducted in the United States “should be in the millions . . . by next week” appears to significantly beyond any realistic assessment of what is logistically possible. About 600,000 Coronavirus tests have been conducted in eight countries that have experienced outbreaks since the virus first surfaced in Wuhan, China back in December, Business Insider reports. As of March 8, the breakdown of the number of tests completed by country, according to Business Insider, is: The most recent estimate of the total number of Coronavirus tests conducted in the United States as of Thursday in any venue is about 5,000. Biden’s plan offered no specifics as to how 995,000 additional Coronavirus tests could be administered next week in the United States. Politico reported on Tuesday that the ability to ramp up testing is being hampered by limited availability of key materials. A looming shortage in lab materials is threatening to delay coronavirus test results and cause officials to undercount the number of Americans with the virus. . . CDC Director Robert Redfield told POLITICO on Tuesday that he is not confident that U.S. labs have an adequate stock of the supplies used to extract genetic material from any virus in a patient’s sample — a critical step in coronavirus testing. “The availability of those reagents is obviously being looked at,” he said, referring to the chemicals used for preparing samples. “I’m confident of the actual test that we have, but as people begin to operationalize the test, they realize there’s other things they need to do the test.”   Biden’s plan announced on Thursday does not specify the cost associated with these recommendations. Instead, it states that “Biden believes we must spend whatever it takes, without delay, to meet public health needs and deal with the mounting economic consequences.” “The American people deserve an urgent, robust, and professional response to the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,” the statement announcing his plan begins: That is why Joe Biden is outlining a plan to mount: Biden’s plan focuses on the need for more testing, echoing a theme first advanced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi minutes after President Trump addressed the nation on Wednesday night. His plan identifies five specific recommendations for Coronavirus testing under the heading “Make Corona Testing Widely Available and Free.” In Congressional testimony on Thursday, a key member of the Trump administration conceded that the current testing plan “is failing,’ the Wall Street Journal reported: The federal government’s top infectious-disease doctor said the nation’s system for disease testing has failed during the coronavirus outbreak because people typically need a doctor’s permission to be tested. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified Thursday at a congressional hearing. “That is a failing. It is a failing. Let’s admit it.” . . . In testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Dr. Fauci said the nation’s system is set up for doctors to request tests be done, but not for patients to pursue testing on their own. “You put it out in the public and a physician asks for it and you get it,” Dr. Fauci told lawmakers. “The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.” Fox News reported on Wednesday that Vice President Pence is focused on cutting red tape to get more Coronavirus test kits manufactured and distributed: The COVID-19 test requires three culture swabs: one from the nose, one from the throat and one from the lower lungs. The test requires a person to inhale deeply, cough and spit up saliva and mucus into a sterile collection cup. Pence said that the president’s most important move was bringing in the leaders from the top commercial laboratories in the country, such as Quest and LabCorp, to work with their administration. Pence said that they have already approved a test that is being processed for mass distribution. “We’re clearing the red tape out of the way. That’s going to be the way that in the days ahead we’re going to have a broad-based test available across the country,” he said. The Trump campaign immediately punched back Thursday afternoon at Biden’s Coronavirus plan: In the past, Joe Biden has shown terrible judgment and incompetence in the face of public health issues. The Obama White House had to publicly apologize for and clean up after Biden when his irresponsible remarks caused panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Just weeks ago, he was openly critical of President Trump’s early move to restrict travel from China to the United States in response to the coronavirus – a decision which medical experts agree helped impede the spread of the virus to this country. Yesterday his campaign actually raised the vile conspiracy theory that the President purposely allowed the coronavirus to spread. In times like this, America needs leadership and Biden has shown none. President Trump acted early and decisively and has put the United States on stronger footing than other nations. His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears. While the Trump administration response to date on getting Coronavirus tests out as widely as many health experts believe they should be has been criticized from both sides of the aisle, the Biden plan announced today appears to offer little in the way of practical recommendations to achieve that objective more readily.","Joe Biden Calls for More Coronavirus Testing, Offers No Solution for Shortage of Key Materials",2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/joe-biden-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-offers-no-solution-for-shortage-of-key-materials/,Breitbart
"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has released resources for K-12 teachers and local officials on managing student privacy and ensuring disabled students receive required services during school closures due to the coronavirus outbreak. In addition, since the federal education department issues directives regarding requirements, assessments, and accountability to all local public school districts, the department is considering “flexibilities” during this time of many school closures amid the coronavirus outbreak. Today, we released new resources for educators and local leaders on K-12 flexibilities, student privacy, and educating students with disabilities during the coronavirus outbreak. More info at: https://t.co/y505E6HQS1 Learn more here ⬇️https://t.co/URGhh2EfuN pic.twitter.com/NocKtCKW3h — U.S. Department of Education (@usedgov) March 12, 2020  “We are working closely with our inter-agency partners to provide state and local leaders the information they need to ensure the health and safety of their students and educators,” said DeVos in a press statement. “We will continue to work alongside them and provide them the flexibilities they need in order to best support their communities.” The resources consist of guidance to help education leaders protect student privacy, i.e., managing public health issues related to coronavirus while protecting the privacy of student education records and to ensure students with disabilities continue to receive the services required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Additionally, the education department released information on the “flexibilities” that will be permitted when it comes to accountability standards that are required by the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Specifically, the press statement says that, should a school be closed for an extended period and be unable to meet federal requirements due to absenteeism, the education department would “consider a targeted one-year waiver so that the participation rate or absenteeism metric would not be factored into the school’s Academic Achievement indicator.” The department has posted a “fact sheet” for K-12 schools regarding such “flexibilities.” Regarding federally required state assessments, for example, the department states in the document: [D]ue to the unique circumstances that may arise as a result of COVID-19, such as a school closing during the entire testing window, it may not be feasible for a State to administer some or all of its assessments, in which case the Department would consider a targeted one-year waiver of the assessment requirements for those schools impacted by the extraordinary circumstances. States with schools that must close due to the COVID-19 may also want to consider whether it is possible to adjust or extend the testing window to accommodate as many students as possible, including students in schools that were closed for some period. Similarly, a “Q & A” document has been posted to assist state and local education officials with information regarding IDEA and how to continue services to disabled students during school closures. The IDEA guidance states that, if local education authorities continue to provide education to the general student population during a school closure, then they must also ensure disabled students have equal access to those education opportunities.",Education Department Releases K-12 Guidance amid Coronavirus School Closures,2020-03-12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/ed-dept-guidance-coronavirus-school-closures/,Breitbart
"Princess Cruises and Viking Cruises announced on Wednesday major delays and suspensions in light of the coronavirus pandemic. “It is our intention to reassure our loyal guests, team members and global stakeholders of our commitment to the health, safety and well-being of all who sail with us, as well as those who do business with us, and the countries and communities we visit around the world,” Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, said in the company’s official statement, sent to USA TODAY by spokesperson Negin Kamali. The voluntary 60-day suspension will not go so far as to refund, but tickets will be transferable to a future trip when cruises resume. Princess will also offer “generous future cruise credit” to sweeten the deal. “Princess will honor this offer for those guests who had made final payment and cancelled their booking on or after February 4, 2020,” the cruise line said. “The future cruise credit can be used on any voyage departing through May 1, 2022.” Viking Cruises has made a similar announcement but has gone one step further by making the “difficult decision to temporarily suspend operations” for all cruises, beginning on Thursday and going through at least April 30. “I am writing today because the situation has now become such that operating as a travel company involves significant risks of quarantines or medical detentions, which could diminish the travel experiences for which our guests have been planning,” Viking chairman Torstein Hagen wrote. “As a private company with strong finances, we do not have to worry about quarterly profit expectations – and that flexibility allows us the ability to do what is best for our guests and our employees, as we have always done.” “This is a decision we made with a heavy heart, but with present circumstances what they are, we are unable to deliver the high-quality Viking experience for which we are known,” Hagen said. “We will stand by our guests, employees and partners in these challenging times and hope that they in turn will stand by us.” The coronavirus, officially dubbed “COVID-19” by the World Health Organization, has been officially classified as a global pandemic.

"A judge has ordered the release of former soldier Chelsea Manning because federal officials no longer need Manning’s evidence for the investigation against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The decision came a day after Manning reportedly attempted suicide. Manning was put in detention after the former soldier refused to testify against Assange, who posted secret information that was leaked to him by Manning. In 2013, Manning was convicted of providing classified data to Assange and was sentenced to 35 years in jail by a military court. President Barack Obama subsequently released Manning in 2017. The Washington Post reported: The grand jury investigating the anti-secrecy group is no longer active, federal judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia said. “Ms. Manning’s appearance before the grand jury is no longer needed,” he wrote. “Her detention no longer serves any coercive purpose.” Manning has been detained in the Alexandria Detention Center for 11 months in civil contempt for her refusal to testify. The judge’s order comes a day after the former Army private tried to commit suicide in jail. Authorities said they stepped in before serious harm occurred. After allegedly leaking information to Assange, Manning declared that she was transgender. The declaration was widely applauded by progressives.

"Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) says the “rapid spreading of racism” since the Wuhan, China-originated coronavirus outbreak in the United States is particularly “painful” for immigrants. During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Thursday, Pressley — a member of “The Squad” along with Representatives Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — said calling the virus the “Chinese coronavirus” is hurtful to immigrants living in the U.S. “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen not only the spreading of the virus, but also a rapid spreading of racism and xenophobia,” Pressley said. “We have witnessed at the highest levels, in fact, the Republican Party fanning irresponsibly these flames. One colleague tweeted that ‘Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus.'” “My district is home to nearly 32 percent foreign-born residents with more than a quarter immigrating from Asia,” Pressley continued. “This painful rhetoric has consequences. Restaurants across Boston’s Chinatown have seen up to an 80 percent drop in business, and I believe this has everything to do with the rapid spread of misinformation and paranoia. It is critical that we stand against these inciteful messages… in our communities.” Pressley was making a reference to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who has called the virus the “Chinese coronavirus” while blasting the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda on the global health crisis. Pressley’s remarks echo those of the Chinese government’s media wing, which has claimed that “racism, profiling, hate, and alienation of the Chinese person” amid the coronavirus outbreak is worse than the actual virus.

"Democrats continue to push “globalist” policies amid a worldwide coronavirus outbreak, noted Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Scott Perry (R-PA), highlighting Democrat opposition to travel bans as measures to protect Americans from viral spread. The two congressmen offered their remarks on Wednesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX). “It feels as if this could be a black swan moment for globalism,” said Mansour. “This could also be a moment where we all open our eyes to how dangerously dependent we have been on China.” She asked if the coronavirus outbreak offers an opportunity for bipartisanship in addressing America’s dependence on China for pharmaceutical and medical exports. Biggs replied, “I struggle to see bipartisanship emerging in the current environment. Our folks on the other side of the aisle, they do believe in globalism. They still believe, regardless of risk, in an open southern border. If not for the fact that we’re sitting in a coronavirus issue that’s unprecedented in so many ways, they would be insisting that the president cannot ban travel for either safety or health reasons.” Biggs continued, “They are dyed-in-the-wool globalists and that makes it the idea of working with people who don’t believe ‘America First.’ They still adhere to the Howard Zinn viewpoint of America, which is that we were never good, we were never great, we are an immoral country, and many of them would like to see us become something else.” LISTEN:  Preserving American exceptionalism requires a defeat of Democrats’ political vision, Biggs determined. “I think that we’re going to have to take the House back and maintain the Senate, and get reinforcements in there that understand this country is unique [and] has a unique founding,” Biggs remarked. “It was a divine founding, and [America is] a place that has the light for the whole world. If we ever give that up — if we give it over to the other folks — then I’m not sure that we get that light back in this the world for a very, very long time.” Perry said, “What Andy says [is] absolutely true. They are globalists at heart, and even though I think many of them recognize what China is up to, they simply refuse to really join the Republican Party.” Perry went on, “Case in point, when people refer to it as the virus started in Wuhan, or the Wuhan virus, or anything related to China, immediately our colleagues on the other side of the aisle call us ‘racist.’ These are facts. Facts are facts… It’s not meant to be pejorative. It’s just meant to describe where these maladies have occurred and started from so that we never forget what we learned in the process of trying to fix the situation that we’re in.” Democrats prioritize perceived partisan political advantage over national security, Perry stated. “Instead of getting to the problem at hand, they are so globalist and so disrespectful and just have such disdain for the president that they can’t see their way clear to even face the adversary that we have, even it if it’s in the best interest of their own constituents, their own communities, and their own country,” Perry said.

"Friday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) applauded President Donald Trump’s efforts to rescue the nation from the threats of coronavirus, both on a health level and from an economic standpoint. However, he also criticized his Democrat congressional colleagues for using coronavirus to achieve other policy goals. Gaetz told Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs that Democrats were using coronavirus to alter and expand entitlements in America. “[U]nfortunately, Democrats continue to play politics with the legislation that can facilitate the most effective response by the government,” he said. “It’s pretty simple. Republicans are for testing. We are for the purchasing of medical infrastructure. But Republicans do not believe that in response to the coronavirus, we should realign, reorient and massively expand every entitlement program in the United States.” “For example, we should not permanently change the SNAP program in response to the coronavirus, and I think if the American people saw the way these Democrats try to leverage any possible advantage against the President, they would be disgusted by these tactics, and they would support our Commander-in-Chief as he works to mobilize our government at every level,” Gaetz added. Gaetz pleaded with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to eliminate so-called “poison pills” on legislation tied to coronavirus. “Let’s all get rid of the partisan politics, get rid of the poison pills, and work together on behalf of the American people,” he said. “I don’t think that’s too much to ask.

"Nigel Farage has said that the actions of governments across Europe over coronavirus “show the concept of solidarity, so championed by the EU and their globalist friends, now counts for nothing. We are all nationalists now.” President Donald Trump’s recent decision to bar entry from Europe’s borderless Schengen Area shows that he is prioritising Americans’ health concerns over the economy. European politicians heavily criticised President Trump’s decision as “nationalistic”, opining that “viruses do not recognise borders”, while the European Commission said that the EU “disapproves” of the American leader’s “unilateral” decision made “without consultation” of Brussel’s bureaucrats. The Brexit Party leader pointed out that European governments are themselves acting unilaterally — nationalistically — across the bloc, without the authority of Brussels — threatening the would-be superstate’s central mythology that it alone can guarantee Europeans’ collective safety. “Everybody is looking after Number One. Even if it is understandable for individual nations to focus on their own people, the idea of a bloc such as the EU being willing or able to guarantee the safety and security of all of its members is surely shattered,” Mr Farage wrote in The Telegraph.

Given that it is virtually impossible for anybody to prove good health thanks to testing only taking place when people show physical symptoms of the virus, the question must be asked: what price the Schengen Zone now?” However, Mr Farage also condemned Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, for what he sees as a lack of leadership by failing to take more aggressive measures against coronavirus — and particularly for the apparent failure to screen arrivals from Milan on Sunday after the Italian region of Lombardy had declared a state of emergency.

What they will not forgive is a leader who fails to take proper care of his people. Boris Johnson needs to take heed very quickly. ” He added that even if President Trump’s omission of the United Kingdom from his travel ban “is testament to our new status as an independent country… I suspect it will not be long before Britain is also on the no-fly list.” The Brexiteer further criticised Johnson’s government for its scientific expert claiming that 60 per cent of Britons need to catch the Wuhan virus to develop “herd immunity”, as coronavirus could return annually like the winter flu.

"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has dismissed the case of two Christian midwives who were denied jobs in Sweden for refusing to perform abortions, ruling that the violation of the women’s consciences was “justified”. After losing several court battles in Sweden, the two women — Ellinor Grimmark and Linda Steen — took their plight to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which announced this week it will not take up the case. Swedish law obliges all midwives to perform abortions and makes no allowance for conscientious objection based on religious faith. In dismissing Ms Grimmark’s complaint, ECHR judges recognised there had been “an interference with her freedom of religion under Article Nine” of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) — but insisted that this interference “was proportionate and justified with the view of achieving a legitimate aim.” The interference “had a sufficient basis in Swedish law,” the judges claimed, and “pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the health of women seeking an abortion.” “Sweden provides nationwide abortion services and therefore has a positive obligation to organise its health system in a way as to ensure that the effective exercise of freedom of conscience of health professionals in the professional context does not prevent the provision of such services,” the judges declared. European Court Orders Bosnia to Remove a Serbian Orthodox Church https://t.co/5OkqDjxtNF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 2, 2019  Both women received state funding for their training in Sweden as midwives, but despite Sweden’s acute midwife shortage, they were refused midwifery jobs when they revealed they would be unwilling to carry out abortions. Ms Grimmark applied for a job at the women’s clinic at Värnamo Hospital, which denied her the position but offered her counselling “in order to come to terms with abortions and to change her mind.” The women attempted to redress the wrong through Sweden’s legal system, arguing unsuccessfully that they had suffered discrimination because of their Christian faith and that their freedom of conscience had been violated. The European Court ruling echoed a recent report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which stated that religious liberty must surrender to “human rights” such as the right to an abortion or same-sex marriage. UN official Ahmed Shaheed lamented religiously-informed “laws and policies that restrict sexual and reproductive rights,” including “partial or total bans on access to abortion and contraception.” In his report, Mr Shaheed explicitly condemned the appeal to conscientious objection to avoid having to perform abortions. “One area of particular concern regarding accommodations to national law for religious beliefs is the use of conscientious objection by healthcare providers and institutions unwilling to perform abortions or provide access to contraception on religious grounds,” the Special Rapporteur stated. Shaheed said that the Human Rights Committee “has called on States to ensure that women have access to legal abortion notwithstanding conscientious objection by medical practitioners, which it has referred to as a ‘barrier’ to access.” ‘Death Panel’: European Court Says Terminal Baby Must Die Despite Parents Funding Extra Care https://t.co/3n6nHdP0fA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 29, 2017  Follow @tdwilliamsrome",European Human Rights Court Rules Against Christian Midwives Who Will Not Abort Babies,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/14/european-human-rights-court-rules-against-christian-midwives-who-will-not-abort-babies/,Breitbart
"UNITED NATIONS (AP) – Allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation in UN peacekeeping and political missions rose significantly in 2019, with allegations against civilian personnel nearly doubling, a UN report said Friday. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in the report to the UN General Assembly that while the number of alleged victims and perpetrators decreased last year, the number of allegations increased to 80 from the 56 reported in 2018. More than half of the 2019 allegations — 41 — were related to the UN peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic, while 15 involved the mission in Congo, the report said. The joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur, the UN force in Lebanon, and the former peacekeeping missions in Liberia and Haiti accounted for three-fourths of the remaining 24 cases, it said. The rest involved three special political missions — the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia, and the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea -Bissau. The United Nations has long been in the spotlight over allegations of child rape and other sexual abuses by its peacekeepers, especially those based in Central African Republic and Congo. But the latest figures demonstrate again that sexual misconduct spans the entire UN system. The report said allegations involving UN civilian personnel rose from 13 in 2018 to 25 in 2019, while allegations involving military personnel increased from 39 in 2018 to 49 in 2019. There were 37 allegations associated with paternity claims, it said. As for sexual exploitation and abuse involving staff working for UN agencies, funds and programs, it said 95 allegations were reported in 2019, up from 93 in 2018. UN Study: 90% of All People Hold ‘Deeply Ingrained Bias’ Against Women https://t.co/EoZba5csvE — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 6, 2020  Guterres stressed in the report that the majority of the more than 190,000 uniformed and civilian personnel in more than 30 bodies in the UN system serve “with professionalism and dedication,” but he said “significant challenges” remain in dealing with sexual abuse and exploitation. “The high turnover of personnel, combined with the vulnerable environments in which the United Nations operates, require constant vigilance to ensure that systems are in place to identify and mitigate risk, screen and train our personnel and respond in a victim-centred, timely and robust way to allegations when they are received,” the UN chief said. Guterres has made combating sexual abuse and exploitation a high priority and stressed enforcement of the UN’s “zero-tolerance” policy for sexual misconduct. He initiated a series of reforms to UN peacekeeping to speed up investigations, and appointed a victims’ advocate to help victims of sexual abuse. But Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free World and its Code Blue campaign, which works to fight impunity for sexual exploitation and abuse by UN personnel, said the numbers in the report demonstrate “that the UN is failing, that the secretary-general’s new approach is not succeeding.” She told The Associated Press that “sexual exploitation, at least when tracked year after year after year, is not improving because of the special measures that have been taken.” Donovan also pointed to the report’s finding that 42 per cent of investigations completed since 2010 substantiated allegations, while 58 per cent were unsubstantiated — either for lack of evidence or the alleged perpetrator being fired for misconduct or leaving the United Nations. Asked about the criticism, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that “the report is a very clear picture of the situation.” “The secretary-general has been focused from day one on tackling the scourge of sexual abuse head on,” he said. However, he added, “No one, including the secretary-general can be pleased with the fact that we still have to face these cases and he will continue to focus the work of the organization to tackle it.” UN Flies 'First' EU-funded Planeloads of Somalis, Syrians to Germany, Romania https://t.co/BfeYYMXVQa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 26, 2019 ",Sexual Abuse Allegations Against UN Civilian Staff Double in One Year,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/14/sexual-abuse-allegations-against-un-civilian-staff-double-year/,Breitbart
"The Swedish Public Health Authority has decided to adopt a new strategy in regard to the coronavirus outbreak, stating it will no longer be updating exact numbers of infections. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell spoke at a press conference this week saying that the health authority would be looking at identifying which regions are the most affected by the spread of the coronavirus. “We will no longer discuss whether we have 458 or 562 cases. But instead how large parts of Sweden are affected and how hard they are,” Tegnell said. “These are the kind of questions that will be central to answering. Now it is no longer important to know exactly how many people are infected in Sweden.” Tegnell also said that the health authority expects there is now a high risk of widespread infection of the general public, saying that current infections could be “the tip of an iceberg” and that cases could be more widespread than previously thought, Aftonbladet reports. Swedish authorities have called for limiting gatherings and events to under 500 people to combat the spread of the virus. Aome have cancelled events entirely, while others, such as the Stockholm Royal Dramatic Threatre, have promised to keep events under 450 people including audience and staff. Sweden Not Prepared For Major Coronavirus Outbreak Says Whistle-blower Doctor https://t.co/IvSkpJ9i1U — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 26, 2020  The move to carry on with performances was heavily criticised by Christian Democrat leader Ebba Busch Thor, who wrote on Facebook: “Of course there is no difference between having 499 or 500 people in the audience. The risk lies in the fact that many people gather in the same place.” “In some cases, it is almost inevitable — as in public transport, for example. But theatre visits and other entertainment events can be postponed. It becomes strange that these theatres seem to focus on limiting their losses when the rest of the public sector forces to limit the spread of infection,” she added. Sweden’s ability to handle a major outbreak of the virus has also been called into question by former infection prevention physician Staffan Sylvan, who said there simply is not enough resources to deal with a major outbreak. “At present, our hospitals already have major problems in receiving and caring for urgently ill patients. Why this disinformation about our readiness?” Sweden Govt Says Coronavirus ‘Low Risk’ Will Not Screen Air Travelers https://t.co/WAdmtkoGXa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 26, 2020 ","Sweden to Stop Publishing Coronavirus Numbers, Deems Them ‘Not Important’",2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/14/sweden-to-stop-publishing-coronavirus-numbers-deems-them-not-important/,Breitbart
"Greek authorities have deployed large fans at the Turkish border to blow back against tear gas and other chemicals fired at the Greek border by migrants allegedly armed by Turkey. The large fans were attached to the back of pickup trucks and placed along the border area where Greek authorities have come under repeated attack in recent days by migrants armed with tear gas and with Molotov cocktails. The fans also serve to increase visibility for the Greek authorities, according to a report from Proto Thema, who added that Greek police were also firing blue paint at migrants attempting to cross the border. Civilians have also formed groups to aid authorities, including local hunters and farmers near the border village of Feres, where an estimated 300 or so volunteers are supplying border guards with coffee, water, and food. A video widely circulated on social media also showed a local farmer appearing to be spraying some sort of liquid across the border fence towards roving migrants — later revealed to be simple water, intended to dampen the ground and make it harder for migrants to light fires along the border fence. Proto Thema has released several short videos showing various alleged migrant attacks along the frontier, including a migrant apparently throwing a Molotov cocktail toward Greek border guards.   
  The European Union border agency, Frontex, has announced it will be sending an additional one hundred border guards. Executive Director of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, commented on the measure, saying: “The presence of 100 officers from all around Europe underlines the fact that the protection of the area of the European area of freedom, security and justice is a shared responsibility of all member-states and Frontex.” However, some European governments, such as Finland’s, have said they believe Greece’s decision to suspend asylum applications and push migrants back is “wrong” and against EU law, and the European Commissioner for migration has also suggested that the Mediterranean country must accept migrants who claim to be asylum seekers.

"President Donald Trump announced during his press conference on Friday on the coronavirus outbreak that the United States will be replenishing its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to ensure the nation’s energy security. “Based on the price of oil, I’ve also instructed the Secretary of Energy to purchase at a very good price large quantities of crude oil for storage in the U.S. strategic reserve,” Trump said at the press conference in the White House Rose Garden. “We’re going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry [and furthering] that wonderful goal — which we’ve achieved, which nobody thought was possible — of energy independence,” Trump said. Trump’s announcement follows market turmoil in the international market when Russia and Saudi Arabia’s negotiations recently broke down and the Saudis announced they were increasing production. The industry reacted positively to the president’s announcement, CNBC reported. “It is a fantastic idea,” John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital said in the CNBC report. “The SPR is one of the few levers that the U.S. can pull in times of oil market tumult.” “It has served the country well when supplies get tight or otherwise become unavailable during times of natural disasters or geopolitical turmoil,” Kilduff said. “Releases of supplies have served to short-circuit price rallies in the past, and this filling may well serve to ebb the current sell-off.” “Russia, the world’s second-largest producer, does not appear willing to return to its agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has kept oil in a range around $30 a barrel for much of the last week,” CNBC reported. Saudia Arabia is the de facto leader of OPEC. CNBC reported on Trump’s decision as it relates to the coronavirus: The move to purchase more oil for the U.S. reserve also came as part of the administration’s response of supporting the American economy that’s trying to determine to what extend the novel coronavirus will impact growth. Trump declared a national state of emergency in his Friday speech from the Rose Garden. The Department of Energy describes the importance of the SPR: Established in the aftermath of the 1973-74 oil embargo, the SPR was established to counter a disruption in commercial oil supplies which could threaten the U.S. economy. It is also the critical component for the United States to meet its International Energy Agency obligation to maintain emergency oil stocks. At the press conference, Trump declared a national state of emergency to free up money to help states deal with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) is refusing to listen to the advice of the nation’s leading medical experts, continuing his opposition to travel bans in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. President Donald Trump’s administration has implemented travel bans on China, Iran, and most of Europe to stop the outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S. Leading medical experts said this week that 30 states now have coronavirus cases due to international travel with Europe, from where 70 percent of the world’s new cases are now originating. At least nine leading medical experts said this week that travel bans from highly affected countries are necessary to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Biden, though, has continued his opposition to any travel bans after telling the American public that they must “listen to the experts.” Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said this week the travel bans “have given our country valuable time to prepare, and that is precisely what they were designed to do.” “We knew most of the cases were coming from China and that’s why the President took an unprecedented step of making sure we restricted travel to those areas,” the U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Michael Adams said in a statement. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress this week that without the travel bans, the U.S. would be “worse” off in terms of fighting the coronavirus and confirmed again that, specifically, a travel ban on Europe would stop outbreaks in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield has repeatedly reiterated that travel from Europe is the “real threat” to the U.S. when it comes to containing the coronavirus. Another five leading medical experts agree that travel bans are necessary to stop the spread inside the U.S. of the coronavirus: CDC’s Dr. Stephen Redd: “Within weeks of identifying the outbreak … the restriction of travel from China reduced travel by 90%. I think that was a very helpful move to prevent more cases from China coming into the United States.” [Emphasis added] Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx: “It’s clear that the early work of the president, both with travel restrictions and the ability to quarantine, has bought us the time and space to have this task force be very effective.” [Emphasis added] Professor of Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center Dr. Marc Siegel: “I think [the President] made a very robust response to travel. I definitely agree with Dr. Fauci that [travel bans] decreased the number of cases that we’re seeing here in the United States right now.” [Emphasis added] Chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths Dr. Betsy McCaughey: “The President is doing exactly the right thing by attempting to keep this coronavirus from becoming endemic inside the United States.” [Emphasis added] Medical Director for CityMD Dr. Janette Nesheiwat: “We still need to take precautions … we need to control the incoming cases from around the world, so we know that our President, starting tomorrow, is going to put a temporary ban on travel from Europe, and then we have to focus on containing it in the United States.” [Emphasis added] Regardless, Biden has ignored the advice, denouncing travel bans as a measure that “will not stop” the coronavirus, which directly contradicts at least nine leading medical experts’ opinions. A wall will not stop the coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it. — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) March 13, 2020  This week, Biden released his “combat coronavirus” plan, which does not include a single travel ban — not even for Wuhan, China, where the virus originated — and does not mention the terms “Wuhan” or “China” despite their connections to the issue. If implemented, Biden’s plan would mean that flights directly from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan could continue as regularly scheduled into the interior of the U.S. and every major American city. Biden’s coronavirus plan is similar to that of his 2020 Democrat opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in that both have effectively ruled out protecting American citizens by implementing travel bans. Sanders, this week, explicitly said that he would not close America’s borders even if it stopped the spread of the coronavirus. There have been 2,110 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 48 deaths in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"President Donald Trump on Friday night announced his support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s bill to help Americans impacted financially by the spread of the coronavirus. “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!” Trump said about the bill on Twitter, noting that he fully supported it. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act was the product of heavy negotiations between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after the Speaker released a first draft of the bill on Wednesday night. The president initially stated his opposition to the bill on Thursday, noting that it had too many unrelated “goodies” that Democrats were trying to cram in the bill. Pelosi and Mnuchin continued negotiating throughout Friday as the president announced a state of emergency in the United States to further attack the spread of the coronavirus. The bill includes two weeks of paid sick leave and family medical leave for people affected by the virus, and it strengthens unemployment insurance for people losing their jobs. The bill also includes funding for meal programs for students and seniors. The bill will also make coronavirus tests free for uninsured Americans. But the bill does not include President Trump’s request for a payroll tax cut, something that Democrats viewed as a non-starter. The House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Friday night, and it will likely pass easily with Trump’s support. “I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

"President Donald Trump suggested that he would get tested for the coronavirus at some point, even though he repeatedly said there was no reason to do so as long as he was not showing symptoms. When a reporter asked Donald Trump if he would get tested for the virus after getting photographed next to someone who later tested positive to the virus, he replied, “Most likely, yeah, not for that reason, but because I think I will do that anyway.” When asked when he would get tested, he said that it would happen soon. “Fairly soon, we’re working on that. We’re working out a schedule,” Trump said. The president also received scrutiny after he spent time with CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp, who self-quarantined after having contact with a CPAC attendee who was later found to have the virus. In the past, Trump has repeatedly said he felt no reason to get tested for the virus as long as he was not showing symptoms.

"Dr. Karen Effrem, a pediatrician and education freedom advocate, died on February 12 at the age of 60 after a ten-year battle with breast cancer. Effrem, the president of Education Liberty Watch and co-founder and executive director of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, frequently offered her comments and insights to Breitbart News over the past ten years as parents throughout the nation battled against the Common Core standards in their respective states. The hundreds of articles and insights she shared with parents and lawmakers across the country provided inspiration and sound knowledge and data to help them in their respective fights for parental control of education. With a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University and her pediatric training from the University of Minnesota, Effrem testified before Congress and provided a multitude of writings that analyzed the damage caused by federal control of education, the need for student data privacy, and the fight to maintain parental rights. In addition to her frequent comments to Breitbart News, Effrem was quoted by Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the British Medical Journal, National Journal, Bloomberg News, Politico, CNSNews, and other media outlets. When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced in January 2019 an executive order to eliminate the Common Core standards in his state, Effrem immediately went to work to assist with the rewrite of the Florida math standards. Even in January, only two weeks before her passing, Effrem emailed Breitbart News with her comments on the status of the Florida math standards. “Much stronger and earlier use of the standard algorithm,” she wrote, “with strong emphasis on procedural fluency.” As ill as she was, she continued, “I will be checking about Euclidian geometry and Algebra I by 8th grade.” “Untold numbers of children and their families owe more than they’ll ever know to Karen Effrem,” Jane Robbins, attorney, writer, and frequent co-author with Effrem, told Breitbart News, adding Effrem was a tireless advocate who gave of herself to the very end of her life: She did as much for pro-family education advocacy as anyone in this country. Not only was she brilliant and an encyclopedia of knowledge, but she was utterly tireless. Many times, when I was ready to give up on a particular issue or effort, she talked me into writing just one more piece or having just one more meeting – what do we have to lose? Three weeks before she died, she called to fill me in on the rewrite of the Florida math standards, to which she had contributed so much. She didn’t even mention her health until I asked her how she was doing. As a pediatrician, Karen operated under the guiding principle of protecting innocent children. The threats to kids came from Common Core, and from invasion of their data privacy, and from turning them into guinea pigs for government-sponsored probing of their psyches and personalities. She would fight anything that harmed children. And because so much of what happens in government schools harms children, she never took a break. Upon news of Effrem’s passing, United States Parents Involved in Education retweeted a tribute to her by Georgia Stop Common Core. “We’ve lost a true leader in education activism,” the Georgia parents’ group said. “Dr. Karen Effrem was a brilliant & gentle woman, but a warrior for children.” “Her work in the effort to #StopCommonCore in Florida has left a template for other states to follow,” the group added: She was an amazing woman and warrior for children. She will be dearly missed. RIP Karen🙏🏻💕 https://t.co/EpAxr4Hz8K — USPIE (@StopFedEd) February 14, 2020  Ann Marie Banfield, an education researcher and parental rights advocate in New Hampshire, also shared with Breitbart News that Effrem was “an invaluable resource for parents who fought for parental rights and quality public schools.” Banfield, who also fought against the Common Core standards in New Hampshire, said, “Karen’s detailed research helped all of us fight for our children.” “Fortunately, we still have access to her research so that her legacy will continue,” she added. “We are all grateful for her commitment to parents and children across the country.” Effrem is survived by her husband, Paul; her parents, Gerald and Ruth Swedeen; her children, Maria, Tim and Chris; her grandchildren Gerald and Joseph; her sisters Pam and Paula and their families; and many family and friends. “Despite the enormous battles to be fought, Karen was ever optimistic,” Robbins reflected. “She knew Who was in charge – she loved the Lord and had unshakable faith. What a privilege to have worked with her.”","In Memoriam: Dr. Karen Effrem, Advocate for Education Freedom and Parental Rights",2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/in-memoriam-dr-karen-effrem-advocate-for-education-freedom-and-parental-rights/,Breitbart

"Frank Gaffney, executive chairman and founder of the Center for Security Policy, called for the Trump administration to stop a federally administered retirement fund from investing in Chinese equities, warning of China gaining further leverage over America through the one-party state’s growing control of U.S. finances. On Wednesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight, Gaffney joined host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) to explain how the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), a federal government agency managing the pension funds of federal employees and military personnel, is moving towards greater investment in Chinese securities. Gohmert said of FRTIB, “Some Obama appointees are moving very, very quickly to invest tens of billions of dollars in China and, significantly, in countries that do not meet the requirements of the law with transparency and other requirements. And yet, they’re rushing headlong into putting our retirement accounts in Chinese companies, some of whom make weapons that kill our soldiers.” Increasing interconnectedness between Chinese and American capital markets will soon be “inflicted upon” federal government employees if FRTIB’s intentions are allowed to proceed, warned Gaffney. FRTIB’s plans are “to have [federal employees’] retirement funds — at least those that are being invested in a diversified international portfolio — compulsorily invested in Chinese companies,” explained Gaffney, “some of which are engaged in building South China Sea islands and proliferating various weapon systems for which they’ve been sanctioned; or oppressing Uighurs and other minorities in China with the so-called social credit system; or building weapon systems to be used against Americans.” LISTEN:  Gaffney continued, “Now, think about that for a minute. American military veterans and active personnel are being put in the position [where] they will shortly be compelled to invest their money — their retirement funds — in the companies that are trying to help the Chinese Communist Party being positioned to kill them. It’s obscene.” Gaffney added, “We have already transferred, by some estimates, three trillion dollars from our capital markets to China, and this has enabled all of the bad things that the Chinese are doing. It is the petty cash war that has underwritten so [many] of the threats that we’re now facing from them.” “They aspire to get another three to five trillion dollars out of [U.S.] capital markets in the near future,” said Gaffney of China, “and people in Wall Street are still determined to do that.”  China’s growing control of America’s retirement funds afford the one-party state leverage over the U.S., warned Gaffney.  He remarked, “When 160 — maybe — million Americans have their retirement funds — and other college funds for their kids, and who knows what else — [and] their investment dollars tied up in China, not because they want them there but because that’s what Wall Street has done through these passively managed indexes, you will have created the largest China lobby in the history of the world, and it will be vastly more difficult for us to make the kind of sovereign and security decisions that are vital to our future freedoms under the circumstances,” Gaffney stated. Expanding influence over American financial instruments may enable China to halt future national security measures such as a the coronavirus-related travel ban, Gohmert speculated. FRTIB is run by a five-person board appointed by the executive branch, Gaffney noted. “It’s a five-member board that no one ever heard of,” he said. “It is a partisan operation. It’s still populated by four Democratic representatives members that were appointed during the Obama years, and there’s a fifth who is a Republican, perhaps in name only.” Gaddney went on, “About three years ago, they made a decision that they would begin in 2020 to mirror one of these indexes. It’s called the Morgan Stanley National Index, and it’s the all-country world index ex-U.S., which is a real mouthful, but it’s basically an index that incorporates some six — and increasingly, I think, it will be seven — percent of its holdings in Chinese companies, including some that are directly tied into the People’s Liberation Army as well as the Chinese Communist Party doing malevolent things.” China games globalized capital flows, including U.S. foreign investment via retirement pension funds, to fund its geopolitical ambitions, explained retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, to Breitbart News in September 2019. Increasing U.S. investment in China-based companies places American investors at risk given China’s weaker transparency regulations relative to America, explained Gaffney. “This is imprudent from a financial point of view,” Gaffney estimated. “Look at what’s happening to these Chinese companies. One of them, it was announced last year, lost 4.4 billion dollars. It just went missing. How many more of these companies are in similar financial circumstances is anybody’s guess because we don’t require these Chinese companies in our capital markets to meet our requirements under our laws for transparency, for accountability, for governance, [or] for risk disclosure for heaven’s sakes. They’re given a pass.” Gaffney continued, “I think this was a result of President Obama’s direction, but the SEC — the Securities and Exchange Commission — is continuing this practice, so we don’t really know whether these companies are financially viable, let alone exposing our investors to the reality that they are investing in companies and business and entities that are absolutely inimical to our vital interests, our security interests, among others, our human rights values and the like. This is just insane.” “This mustn’t be allowed to metastasize further into the $500-or-so billion-dollar Federal Thrift Savings Plan, so we need people on the net to be letting the president know this should not happen,” advised Gaffney.
 Mansour asked what can be done to halt China’s growing control of U.S. retirement funds. Gaffney advised the implementation of an “America First” ethos beyond manufacturing to include federal regulation and policy regarding retirement funds, beginning with FRTIB. “My best answer is this is an opportunity to invest in an America First program,” Gaffney recommended. “There is an enormous amount that needs to be done. We’ve been talking about infrastructure for years. There’s innovation. There’s research and development — among other things — for our military. But not least, there’s also the simple capitalization of the lead institution of an American industrial sector, so we can manufacture medicines in this country again, and gloves, and masks, and all kinds of other medical gear, and all of the other things that we foolishly allowed to be shipped off by people whose only interest was maximizing their quarterly profits, and the devil take the hindmost with respect to the national interest, especially the national security interest. So I’d like to say we have an opportunity.” Gaffney added, “I think if the American people get behind this idea that patriotic investing is the alternative — not continuing to invest in our enemies.” Gaffney invited listeners to visit the committee on the Present Danger: CHINA, an organization of which he is vice president.

Trump urged every state to set up emergency operations centers. “You’re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world,” he said, as top executives from health care companies and medical labs stood with the president. The president focused primarily on increasing the number of testing kits available for sick patients who needed to be diagnosed for the virus. Executives from Walmart, CVS, Target, and Walgreens promised to work with the president to increase testing levels and care for individuals. “The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,” he said. Doug McMillon from Walmart said that the company was “eager” to assist the president. “Given what we’re facing, that’s certainly important to do,” he said. “We should all be doing that.” Brian Cornell of Target acknowledged that the CEOs present were typically competitors in the medical and supply industry. “Normally, you’d view us as competitors, but today we’re focused on a common competitor, and that’s defeating the spread of the coronavirus,” he said. The president highlighted efforts from companies Roche and Thermo Risher, as well as LabCorp and Quest, to speedily produce tests and promised that the government would quickly approve them for production. Trump also thanked Google for using its resources and 1,700 engineers to create a website that would help sick Americans locate a testing site. “It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” Trump said. The president also spoke about using his authority to clear the red tape of regulations that might hinder hospitals, doctors, and nursing homes to allow them to properly treat patients infected with the virus. “We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to,” he said. “No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever.” During his press conference, he ceded his powerful podium to government medical professionals including Dr. Deborah Birx, who is helping the vice president lead the task force and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Birx said that the team had accomplished a great deal behind the scenes in the past weeks, acknowledging that it was “invisible” to the press. “[T]his intense effort has not only resulted in innovative solutions but an automated high-throughput system, bringing the availability of these quality coronaviral testing to the American people at unprecedented speed,” she said. Fauci praised Trump’s declaration for allowing everyone to act as quickly and efficiently as possible to fight the virus. “We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases, but we’ll take care of that,” he said. “And ultimately, as the President said, this will end.”",The Whole of America Approach: Donald Trump Assembles Government and Private Industry to Fight Coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/the-whole-of-america-approach-donald-trump-assembles-government-and-private-industry-to-fight-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Populist conservative author and columnist Pat Buchanan is noting that if 2020 Democrats like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were in charge today, American taxpayers would be forced to provide free healthcare to all illegal aliens and border-crossers amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. In a column this week, Buchanan argues the coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan, China, has exposed the agenda of a borderless world with interconnected economies, free trade, and cheaply-made foreign imports — a worldview that has dominated the opinions of big business, the ruling class, Wall Street, and the donor class for the past 30 years. Buchanan writes: It may one day be said that the coronavirus delivered the deathblow to the New World Order, to a half-century of globalization, and to the era of inter-dependence of the world’s great nations. [Emphasis added] … As for the “open borders” crowd, do Democrats still believe that breaking into our country should no longer be a crime, and immigrants arriving illegally should be given free health care, a proposition to which all the Democratic debaters raised their hands? [Emphasis added] … In retrospect, was it wise to have relied on China to produce essential parts for the supply chains of goods vital to our national security? Does it appear wise to have moved the production of pharmaceuticals and lifesaving drugs for heart disease, strokes and diabetes to China? Does it appear wise to have allowed China to develop a virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals crucial to the development of weapons for our defense? [Emphasis added] Biden and Sanders have both repeatedly said that if elected president, they will provide all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the U.S. with free healthcare that American taxpayers would be forced to pay for. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), running for president on an anti-war platform, has been one of the only 2020 Democrats who has consistently opposed free benefits like healthcare and free college tuition for illegal aliens. Already, due to loopholes, American taxpayers are spending nearly $20 billion every year to provide illegal aliens with subsidized healthcare, emergency room visits, and other health services. Under the 2020 Democrats’ plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens living in the U.S., Americans would be billed potentially $660 billion every decade just to cover the costs. Other research has found that the plan would cost Americans at least $23 billion every year. As Breitbart News has reported, experts have said that giving taxpayer-funded healthcare to effectively all foreign nationals who can make it to America’s borders would drive “strong incentives for people with serious health problems to enter the country or remain longer than their visas allow in order to get government-funded care.” There have been 2,110 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 48 deaths in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"President Donald Trump did not take responsibility for shutting down a global health security team, in response to a PBS White House correspondent. During his coronavirus press conference on Friday, Trump took questions from the press. PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asked the POTUS whether he would “take responsibility” for his administration’s lagging response to the novel coronavirus pandemic: You said that you “don’t take responsibility,” but you did disband the White House Pandemic Office, and the officials that were working in that office left this administration abruptly. So what responsibility do you take for that? The officials in that office said that the White House lost valuable time because that office was disbanded. What do you make of that?  Trump shook his head as the question was being asked. “Well, I just think it’s a nasty question,” he said once Alcindor had finished speaking, “because what we’ve done is — and Tony had said numerous times — that we’ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.” “And when you say “me,” I didn’t do it,” Trump continued. “We have a group of people, I could ask, perhaps, my administration. I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it,” he said, turning and gesturing toward Dr. Tony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “You said we did that, I don’t know anything about it.” “You don’t know about the reorganization that happened at the National Security Council?” Alcindor pressed in a dubious tone. Trump spoke over much of the question, but the phrasing was disjointed. “It’s the administration, perhaps they do that, people — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. Things like that happen.” “But this–” Alcindor started, but Trump ended their exchange by signaling to cut her microphone. “We’re doing a great job, let me tell you,” he said.",Trump Shuns ‘Nasty Question’ from PBS White House Correspondent,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/trump-shuns-nasty-question-from-pbs-white-house-correspondent/,Breitbart
"During a press conference on Friday, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) criticized the federal government’s response to the coronavirus and the “inconsistent” messaging from the federal government. She called on President Trump “to step back and appoint one of our public health officials to be the spokesman” and suggested Dr. Anthony Fauci serve as the spokesperson and give daily briefings on the virus. Collins said, “We are making progress at the federal level, but I am not satisfied with the response. I think that the messaging at the federal level has been inconsistent. And when you’re dealing with a novel virus like this, it’s very important that health professionals be out front, and that there be a consistent message. We also, in some parts of the country, are experiencing shortages of tests.” She added, “I would like the president to step back and appoint one of our public health officials to be the spokesman as we go through dealing with this novel virus. My suggestion would be that Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been around for decades, is such a well-regarded infectious disease specialist, has dealt with everything from AIDS to the Zika virus and H1N1 flu be the public face for the federal government. I believe he should give a briefing at the same time each day to update the American people and to also make sure that the messaging is consistent.” (h/t Portland Press Herald) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",GOP Sen.

"The United States’ borders have been flooded with thousands of foreign nationals arriving from countries affected by the Wuhan, China-originated coronavirus. While the U.S. tries to contain the spread of the coronavirus — with leading medical experts blaming international travel and migration for much of the outbreak — nearly 151,000 border crossers and illegal aliens have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border since October 2019 from 72 affected countries, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data reveals. Since October, for example, 1,657 Chinese nationals have been apprehended at the southern border. About 341 of these Chinese nationals sought to enter the U.S. illegally just within the last few months. DHS data finds that Chinese nationals are continuing to arrive at the southern border, with about six being apprehended within the last couple of days. There are now close to 81,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China and 3,180 deaths. “We have a unique public health threat posed by individuals arriving unlawfully at the border, where migrants, law enforcement officials, frontline personnel, and the American public are put at risk,” a senior DHS official told Breitbart News. “All it would take is a single infected individual to impact the detained migrant community within DHS facilities,” the official said. “Without proper precautions, which can only happen through orderly, lawful migration, the virus threatens to spread rapidly. Any halting of [Remain in Mexico] would exacerbate this threat.” Brazil, where 151 cases of the coronavirus are confirmed, has had about 6,400 of their nationals arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border since October. Similarly, eight Iranian nationals, 12 Italian nationals, 346 Russian nationals, 160 Romanian nationals, 204 Vietnamese, 827 Indian nationals, and 1,045 nationals from Cameroon — countries that have a combined coronavirus-infected population of nearly 30,000 and 1,781 deaths. To the south of the U.S., Mexico now has 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and since October, nearly 110,000 Mexican nationals have inundated the southern border. Every confirmed coronavirus case in Mexico involves a person who recently traveled abroad or has been in close contact with a person who recently traveled abroad. Likewise, close to 21,000 Honduran nationals have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past five months as two cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the country. The countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have yet to have any confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but their nationals have traveled through coronavirus-affected Mexico to make their way, illegally, to the U.S. Since October, about 44,370 nationals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have arrived at the southern border by first traveling through coronavirus-affected Mexico. A DHS official told Breitbart News that the volume of migrants, especially from countries with confirmed coronavirus infections, along with crowded federal detention facilities and the straining of public healthcare resources pose a risk in terms of trying to prevent more spread of the virus. Despite the risk, Trump said last week that his administration was not particularly reviewing any plans to close the nation’s most porous border. Already, Trump has implemented travel bans on China, Iran, and most of Europe at the direction of medical experts who say European countries helped spread the coronavirus to about 30 U.S. states. There are now 1,875 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. and 41 deaths. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Appearing Friday on MSNBC’s Deadline White House, Dr. Irwin Redlener, a member of former Vice President Joe Biden’s advisory panel on the coronavirus, called President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly illness an “international embarrassment.” ""It's so late in the process, it's like an international embarrassment of how much we have messed up this entire process of testing that is so critical to our understanding of the disease… It's inexplicable"" – Dr. Irwin Redlener w/ @NicolleDWallace pic.twitter.com/u9jvf8r9CC — Deadline White House (@DeadlineWH) March 13, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows: NICOLLE WALLACE: What did you make of the two big headlines about testing? It went on for so long, about an hour and ten minutes ago we heard from the CEOs of the nation’s chain drugstores. We heard from the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Walgreens, and CVS. What did you make of the information dispensed by them? DR. IRWIN REDLENER: The information was fine — only two months late. I remember about eight weeks ago thinking “what is going on here?” Then, we had a couple hundred tests being done by the CDC and then they distributed the test material around the country about 97 percent of those defective and they pulled it back. I thought It was a one shot, horrible mistake by the federal government and the public health system, but, it’s continuing. It’s still a problem. I spoke to ER doctors this morning who can’t get results. I think it’s going to improve. Governor Cuomo, for example, is starting these drive-through testing facilities. That’s all great and I’m glad that the private sector is getting involved, but it’s so late in the process.

"Roche Diagnostics began shipping 400,000 to 500,000 Coronavirus test kits from the company’s manufacturing facilities in New Jersey on Friday via “the fastest means available” to laboratories around the country. A spokesman for the company, an American subsidiary of Switzerland-based Roche, told Breitbart News on Friday that the SARS-CoV-2 test kits that detect the virus that causes Coronavirus (COVID-19), approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, are being sent to 32 laboratory sites around the country where the company’s cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 molecular testing machines are currently used to run a variety of other medical tests. The spokesman told Breitbart News that 32 out of the 110 laboratory sites in the United States that currently use the cobas 6800/cobas 8800 testing machines were selected as recipients of the first batch of SARS-CoV-2 test kits because they are national reference laboratories or hospitals near areas that have been identified as hot zones of Coronavirus outbreaks. “We want to make tests available to patients where they are needed most. So we worked with the CDC to develop a strategy that prioritizes labs with the broadest geographic reach and highest patient impact. These labs also have the ability to implement high-volume testing immediately,” Roche Diagnostics said in fact sheet emailed to Breitbart News on Friday. The SARS-CoV-2 test is an additional test these laboratories will now be capable of running as early as Monday. Given the current Coronavirus health threats, it is anticipated that many of these laboratories will focus their cobas 6800/cobas 8800 usage on running the SARS-CoV-2 tests. According to the fact sheet emailed to Breitbart News by the company on Friday: The test detects the genetic signature (RNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a simple test performed by a healthcare provider using swab samples from the back of the patient’s throat or nose. . . Healthcare providers can send patient samples to hospital and reference laboratories across the U.S. to run the test. . . After the lab starts the test, results are available in about 3.5 hours. The instruments can process up to 384 results (cobas 6800 System) and 960 results (cobas 8800 System) in an 8-hour shift. Test kits will be shipped throughout the weekend, and all 32 laboratory sites are expected to be ready to run the SARS-CoV-2 tests by Tuesday. The Roche Diagnostics spokesperson told Breitbart News that after the first batch of 400,000 to 500,000 test kits are shipped out this weekend, the company anticipates that it will be able to produce and ship out an additional 400,000 to 500,000 Coronavirus test kits each subsequent week, with an expected monthly test kit production capacity of about 1.5 million. Friday afternoon, President Trump declared a national emergency to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic in the United States. At the press conference announcing the national emergency, “Trump said he expected the U.S. to have 1.4 million coronavirus test kits available within a week, and a total of five million kits within the next month,” CNBC reported. Roche Diagnostics CEO Matt Sause was among several business executives who joined the president at the press conference, as Business Insider reported: CEOs of laboratory, research, and medical device companies also joined Trump, who said that he has called on the labs to expedite efforts to increase the availability of tests for COVID-19. Companies like Roche Diagnostics, whose CEO Matt Sause attended the press conference, recently gained expedited approval for coronavirus testing. The Trump administration has come under criticism for the slow pace at which Coronavirus test kits have been made available in the country. As of earlier this week, only an estimated 5,000 Coronavirus tests had been completed in the United States, a marked contrast to the estimated 320,000 that have been conducted in Guandong Province, China and the 189,000 that have been conducted in South Korea. With weekly shipments of 400,000 to 500,000 SARS-CoV-2 test kits to 32 laboratories, each capable of running Coronavirus tests on a minimum of 384 to a maximum of 2,880 patient samples per day, these laboratories as a group have the capacity to complete anywhere from 12,000 to 92,000 tests per day. Over the next month, that means effective Monday, the United States is expected to have the capacity to complete between 360,000 to 2.7 million Coronavirus tests using the Roche Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 test kits alone. The constraint then becomes Roche Diagnostics’current monthly  production capacity of 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2 test kits. Politico reported on Tuesday that one of the problems with getting Coronavirus test kits distributed in the United States has been a shortage of key materials, specifically, reagents. According to Ann Marie Helminstine, Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences: A reagent is a compound or mixture added to a system to cause a chemical reaction or test if a reaction occurs. A reagent may be used to find out whether or not a specific chemical substance is present by causing a reaction to occur with it. Reagents may be compounds or mixtures. In organic chemistry, most are small organic molecules or inorganic compounds. A shortage of reagents has apparently not been a problem for Roche Diagnostics as it begins production of SARS-CoV-2 test kits, nor does the company expect it to be a problem in the near future. “Everything necessary to carry out the test is in the kit,” the Roche Diagnostics spokesman told Breitbart News.","Roche Diagnostics Ships 400,000 Coronavirus Test Kits to Labs Around the Country for Immediate Use",2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/roche-diagnostics-ships-400000-coronavirus-test-kits-to-labs-around-the-country-for-immediate-use/,Breitbart

"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis on Friday that found that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden’s (D-OR) drug pricing bill would cut spending by $95 billion, reduce out-of-pocket spending, and reduce premiums. The CBO found that Grassley and Wyden’s Drug Pricing Reduction Act would save taxpayers $95 billion, reduce out-of-pocket spending by $72 billion, and reduce premiums by $1 billion. Grassley said in a statement on Friday: “The bill would basically reform a lot of federal spending on health care, particularly through Medicare, Medicaid,” the Iowa senator said. Grassley explained how the bill would reduce government spending, telling Boyle: We would reduce subsidies from Medicare to the pharmaceuticals. We would put a year-over-year cap on price increases at the rate of inflation. We would put a big cap on the amount of money that one consumer would have to spend out-of-pocket. It would save the taxpayers about 80 billion dollars. It would take some of the secrecy out of the pricing of drugs. It would take some of the secrecy out of the middle man that we call a pharmaceutical benefits managers (PBMs), because all that secrecy keeps the marketplace from working, and more transparency would enhance competition. And with the more transparency you get more accountability, and we don’t have that accountability today. It would do away with the donut hole that I won’t explain, but it’s been a controversial part of Part D since it was established in 2003. But the main thing is it would cause the marketplace to work. It would stop subsidies to Big Pharma. Well, not stop subsidies, but it would limit the subsidies, because presently there’s no limit on how much they can increase drug prices – this year five to ten percent – and it ought to be limited to the inflation rate. So that’s a broad summary. It does a lot more than what I just told you. During Trump’s State of the Union address, the president promised to sign a bipartisan drug pricing bill. Trump said: And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. “Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay,” he added.

"CLAIM: President Donald Trump “fired the entire White House pandemic team.” VERDICT: Partly false. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton “dissolved” the pandemic office but staff remained to deal with the issue. Last month, Democrats tried a new way of blaming Trump for the coronavirus outbreak. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg claimed during the Democrat debate in South Carolina that Trump “fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, so there’s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. [Applause] And he’s defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC so we don’t have the organization we need.” Breitbart News rated that “Mostly False.” We noted: In reality, the pandemic expert — Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer — left the National Security Council (NSC) voluntarily after then-National Security Advisor John Bolton was appointed. Bolton disbanded the unit that Ziemer was supervising as part of an effort to downsize the bloated NSC staff… The Trump administration has indeed proposed cuts to the CDC, but they have not been passed by Congress. Moreover, some of the experts who had been part of the office remained on staff at the National Security Council. Earlier this week, Democrats asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the president’s coronavirus team who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, about the decision to cut the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense. He was asked whether it had been a “mistake.” Fauci said no, but added that it would also have been “nice” to have it around. “I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there,” he said. Media are leaving out the first sentence. ""I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there."" https://t.co/CNs5O35vzX — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) March 14, 2020  The media largely ignored the first sentence and focused on the second. On Friday, the former head of the pandemic office, Beth Cameron, wrote a lengthy op-ed in the Washington Post complaining about the decision to “dissolve” her unit. She admitted she did not know “whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House’s interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff.” But she argued the decision created “unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.” Still, she did not claim all the experts had been fired. Also on Friday, a journalist at President Donald Trump’s press conference on coronavirus in the Rose Garden at the White House asked the president about the decision to cut the office. Trump said he did not know about it — which he may not have, since it was a decision made by Bolton. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) took to Twitter to accuse the president of lying, and added that Trump had “fired the entire White House pandemic team.” Not true, @realDonaldTrump. I wrote to you more than 600 days ago demanding answers after you fired the entire White House pandemic team. https://t.co/ICbHOkyeyY pic.twitter.com/71OF9gKA3N — Sherrod Brown (@SenSherrodBrown) March 13, 2020  After his tweet was retweeted by a New York Times reporter, several former NSC officials began to push back. Former senior NSC official Tim Morrison — who testified in the impeachment hearings — called Sen. Brown’s claim “total garbage”: Total garbage.  I ran this team for a year and we worked on NSPM 14 (https://t.co/47ZCsvlSoL) and flu(https://t.co/bUVdE3IdgQ) and Ebola (https://t.co/8QsAV5bEyY). https://t.co/vkFb9Dkygg — Tim_Morrison (@Tim_Morrison) March 13, 2020  Former NCS official Richard Goldberg noted that the staff in question were still at the White House: Weird. A year later I was inside the NSC working with talented global health/biodefense professionals who coordinated an incredibly effective response to Ebola. They’re still there. Working hard. On #Covid_19. https://t.co/XSoBtXtAC5 — Richard Goldberg (@rich_goldberg) March 13, 2020  Ultimately, the argument is about whether the office should have been kept as a separate unit, or whether its functions could be done just as well by employees working in other parts of the organizational structure. Fauci, who is a rare case of an expert whose opinion is valued by both sides, said it was not a “mistake” to cut the office but that it would be “nice” if it were still there. He may agree with the criticism — but only up to a point. At some point it is worth questioning whether now is the best time for Democrats to be looking for a way to blame the president, or a way to help him — after wasting weeks on impeachment while he was tackling coronavirus.

"Actor James Woods warned that the Democrat Party and CNN will continue to exploit the coronavirus pandemic to their own ends, but said that America and its economy will soon “roar back” under the direction of President Donald Trump. The stock market had a torrid start to the week amid fears of the coronavirus pandemic, while the White House today declared an official national state of emergency over the crisis. Markets have since made a partial recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1985 points during Trump’s presser.

For example, some Democratic politicians including failed presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg have released ads attacking Trump’s response to the pandemic, while one New York Times columnist even referred to it as the “Trumpvirus.” However, Woods took to Twitter to confirm that he would increase his holdings in the stock market because of his trust in the American nation and the roaring economy that President Trump has helped create: I am buying more stock, because I believe in America, in this robust economy, and in President Trump. While the doom peddlers at #CNN gleefully cheer the demise of this President AT ANY COST to our proud nation, I’m sticking with the plan. #BuyAmerica #Trump2020 I bought stock heavily this week because a) I want to support this nation and this President, and b) I know that #CNN and the Democrats will exploit this crisis purely out of their hatred for @realDonaldTrump. So the market will wobble and then will eventually roar back. #WinWin. https://twitter.com/realjameswoods/status/1238579653574406145?s=21 Woods is known for his Twitter throwdowns in defense of the President and against the Democrat establishment. Last week, the veteran actor ripped Sen. Chuck Schumer over his threats against Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, declaring that America’s Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment as a safeguard against “violent haters” like the New York Senator. “When the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court must take the extraordinary step of admonishing a United States Senator from targeting the lives of named Justices, we are in civil war territory,” Woods said. “The Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment for violent haters like  Chuck Schumer.” When the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court must take the extraordinary step of admonishing a United States Senator from targeting the lives of named Justices, we are in civil war territory.

"“Hot takes” in politics are a little like armpit noises. Anybody can make them and nobody wants to hear somebody else’s. But there is one political “hot take” emerging this week that really must be considered. It is a little like taking a bite out of something that tastes terrible and then turning to someone you love and saying: “Hey, try this. It tastes terrible.” “Joe Biden proved he is a real fighter,” said some of the most revered political experts in the land this week. After the former vice president mopped the floor with Sen. Bernie Sanders in South Carolina and then cleaned up again this week in states like Michigan and Missouri. Yeah, a real fighter, that Joe Biden. A dog-faced-pony-soldier kind of fighter. He really knows how to plot a political rebirth and rise from the ashes like an ancient white phoenix. Actually, no. He is the same rotting corpse of a candidate he was three weeks ago. It’s just that Democrats have decided that they would be better off with the dead guy than with Mr. Sanders. In other words, the Democrat National Committee won. They killed Mr. Sanders in the crib — for the second straight primary in a row. It’s like “Weekend at Bernie’s,” only it stars anyone but Bernie himself. Either way, Mr. Biden is still a corpse. His electoral revival has nothing to do with Mr. Biden being a fighter, except of course when he is attacking defenseless voters. Then he’s a real tough guy. Calls young women “dog-faced,” cusses out gun owners, calls people liars or accuses them of being “fat.” President Trump is a real fighter. He took on the Republican establishment — and won. He gets into epic fights with people who buy ink by the barrel and newsprint by the freight carload. And then — scandal of all scandals — he took on Washington, delivering his First Inaugural that vowed to keep all the promises that had gotten him elected. (These people still haven’t forgiven him for that one.) Even amid the present crisis over coronavirus, Mr. Trump immediately shut borders at the earliest sign of trouble despite desperate accusations he was being alarmist and “xenophobic.” No. Mr. Biden is anything but a fighter. He would never do anything to upset his minders and masters along the Potomac, be they in the Democratic Party or in the press. Mr. Biden is nothing if not obedient and pliable. A Potomac pushover, bobbing for approval. There is another lesson to learn from these past few Democratic primary contests, as well. Despite all the Twitter hysteria and spinelessness among Democrat leaders in Washington, it turns out that regular voters even in the Democratic Party are not actually ready to turn to socialism. That’s a good sign. Quite possibly you have something more in common with your loony sister-in-law after all. Or maybe not. This, of course, should have been obvious to any adult from the beginning. Can you imagine if Democrats had, instead of washed-up Joe Biden, fielded a reasonable, likable and sane candidate last summer who crashed every early debate by demanding what in the hell happened to the Democratic Party? A candidate who refused to raise her hand when asked if she was in favor of giving free health care to illegal immigrants? A candidate who proudly embraced the legacy of former President Barack Obama? Forget the so-called “moderate” lane. Just run in the “adult” lane. Democrats could have fielded a much better candidate who was an actual fighter. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com or @charleshurt on Twitter.",Charles Hurt — The Obedient Mr. Biden: Pliable Joe a Model Beltway Candidate,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/charles-hurt-the-obedient-mr-biden-pliable-joe-a-model-beltway-candidate/,Breitbart
"Job Creators Network president and CEO Alfredo Ortiz urged Congress on Friday to send a relief package to President Donald Trump’s desk with short term loans and payroll tax cuts that will help small businesses thrive in the wake of the coronavirus. “Based on what we are hearing and on news reports, the current House bill being negotiated will be a poison bill for small businesses, leaving small business stranded in the midst of a crisis,” Ortiz said in a statement on Friday. “Cash flow is the name of the game for small business owners right now. What is needed are short term loans and payroll tax cuts that are key to helping small businesses weather this storm, avoid furloughs and keep their doors open. The federal government needs to provide expedited federal unemployment insurance to employees as a safety net for those affected,” Ortiz continued. On Friday, President Trump addressed the nation in the Rose Garden and declared a national emergency that would free up $50 billion to fight the spread of coronavirus. President Trump also announced a plan to waive student interest payments on federal loans and other economic incentives. “A tax credit for paid leave in twelve months isn’t going to help with cash flow now if revenues aren’t coming in the door,” Ortiz said. “Any bill that doesn’t include these short term measures will be nothing more than window dressing and an attempt to exploit a crisis for check the box political gain.” On Friday, Job Creators Network ran a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal USA Today, and, the New York Post with the message, “Small Business is Too Big to Fail.”  Jerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know. Order your copy today.

"Friday on “TMZ Live,” former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said the Democratic Party has to unify behind former Vice President Joe Biden because defeating President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election is a matter of “life or death” in light of his administration’s coronavirus response. Host Harvey Levin asked, “Are you worried that Bernie Sanders supporters are not going to support Joe Biden?” Buttigieg said, “That why it is so important to remember what is at stake here. Saying you are not going to vote for Joe Biden is saying you are not going to vote for higher minimum wage. It’s saying you are not going to vote for an expansion of health care in this country. It’s saying you are not going to vote for real action on climate change. Look, I get that we each are passionately committed to our candidate. I was passionately committed to me being the nominee until I saw it was time to step aside.” “But the distance between us between even the most different of the Democratic contenders and the president we have right now —who by the way right now is responsible for keeping the American people safe and it’s not happening,” he continued. “This is literally life and death.

"President Trump announced Friday that he has enlisted the help of some of America’s biggest companies to contain the spread of coronavirus in the United States, in an “all-of-America” approach. The corporations include Walmart, Walgreens, Target, CVS, and other major companies. Trump introduced and thanked the companies’ leaders individually during a press conference in the White House Rose Garden. “They are simply celebrities in their own right. They’re the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world,” he said. Doug McMillon from Walmart said the White House has asked them to make portions of their parking lots available in select locations so that people can do drive-through testing for coronavirus. “When we got the call yesterday from the White House, we were eager to do our part to help serve the country. And given what we are facing, that’s certainly important to do. We should all be doing that,” McMillon said. Richard Ashworth from Walgreens is ready to engage and help. He said: We are happy to stand in here and help in communities all across America because a lot of times when we have natural disasters, our stores are a beacon in the community and the situation is no differen. So we look forward to partnering with the CDC, the administration, HHS and the task force and specifically to the Vice President doing such a fantastic job. Brian Cornell from Target said the company is committed to keeping its stores open to serve American consumers who are stocking up on household essentials and key food and beverage items. He said: Along with our colleagues from Walmart and Walgreens and our partners at CVS, normally the you’d view us as competitors, but today, we’re focused on a common competitor, and that’s defeating the spread of the coronavirus. We look forward to working with the administration to do our fair share to alleviate this growing threat. Tom Polen from Becton Dickinson, one of the leading providers of medical devices as well as collection products for testing of coronavirus, said the company is ramping up its manufacturing capacity to “ensure that the right collection devices and testing equipment are ready to address this issue.” Stephen Rusckowski from Quest Diagnostics said the company is working with other companies, the FDA, and the CDC, and is “up and running” with testing in a number of facilities. He said: As the President mentioned we now have capabilities from Roche Diagnostics that we will bring into our facilities this weekend and I know myself, my colleagues at LabCorp will be doing the same so the capacity of available to the American public to support this action with consumers will be considerably increased in the next few weeks. Matt Sause from Roche Diagnostics thanked the FDA for their rapid approval of their coronavirus test. He said: We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible because it is critical for us to make that available to help patients in need and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future which will bring hundreds of thousands of test available to patients in need in the United States. David Pierre from Signify Health, the largest house care provider in the U.S., it would go to the homes of the most vulnerable elderly and through its network “stand ready to help and provide our clinicians to be where they are needed whether they are in retail clinics or in the home and we are here to assist.” Adam Schechter from LabCorp said the company is “working every second of every day” to increase the number of tests that can be run. He said: We are working with academic medical centers with our colleagues at Qwest with other hospital and other laboratories to ensure that we do everything we can to increase the testing as we move forward and I can tell you we understand how important the testing is and we are committed to doing everything possible. Thomas Moriarty from CVS said the company is “committed to working with the administration and local public health officials to make this work as well.” Bruce Greenstein from the LHC Group said the company would work to test Americans who cannot get to a test site in their homes. He said: We are very proud to be part of the equation for testing in their own home. For Americans that can’t get to a test site or live in rural areas far away from a retail establishment we are here to help and to partner with our hospitals and physicians as well as the people we have here today that will be doing testing around the country. Vice President Mike Pence also hailed these companies for stepping up and working on combating the coronavirus: These are companies that are synonymous with communities large and small where people come together and now they are going to come together to meet the needs of the American public. These commercial laboratories, LabCorp and Quest and Roche have just done an incredible job stepping forward and they are going to literally make — literally make hundreds of thousands of test available and being processed with results to patients in the very near future. “Every American should be proud of this incredible public-private partnership that is going to be speeding the access of testing to millions of Americans in the weeks ahead,” he said. “Together we will get through this, together we will put the health of America first.”",Trump Enlists Help of American Companies to Stop Coronavirus Spread: ‘All of America’ Approach,2020-03-13,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/13/trump-enlists-help-of-american-companies-to-stop-coronavirus-spread-all-of-america-appproach/,Breitbart
"Hollywood stars hurled insults at President Donald Trump and spread false claims during his latest coronavirus press conference at the White House Rose Garden, where the president declared a national emergency and announced measures that sent the major stock indices soaring late Friday. Celebrities called President Trump an “asshole” and a “moron” on social media as he announced his administration’s plan to free up $50 billion to fight the spread of coronavirus. The president also put forth economic incentives, including waiving student interest payments on federal loans. The Hollywood elite also used their influencer roles to spread fake news to their millions of social media followers about the conference and the president’s response to the global outbreak. Author Stephen King falsely claimed that the president’s coronavirus team is “all male, all old, and all white.” But at Friday’s press conference, at least two women spoke to the media, and one was a woman of color — Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who is part of the White House’s coronavirus response team. Note that Trump’s coronavirus team is all male, all old, and all white. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 13, 2020  Actress Bette Midler continued to spread the false claim that President Trump called the coronavirus a “hoax.” The president used the word “hoax” at a recent campaign rally to describe the Democrats’ attempts to politicize the illness and hurt his administration.

"Saturday during an interview with MSNBC’s Al Sharpton, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), a member of the liberal congressional foursome known as “The Squad,” argued now may be the time to commute sentences of some federal prisoners given their vulnerability to coronavirus. Pressley said she and other congressional Democrats were lobbying the Bureau of Prisons for “compassionate” releases. “[W]hen we are talking about our most vulnerable, our low-income residents and those experiencing homelessness, our seniors and that we are also including the incarcerated men and women, who are amongst one of the most vulnerable populations and given the crowding and overpopulating in our prisons for a confluence of other reasons we won’t get into in this interview, Rev., buy you are certainly well aware of, are an ecosystem and a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic, which is why I partnered with my colleagues, Representatives [Nydia] Velázquez, [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez and [Rashida] Tlaib, to lobby the Bureau of Prisons to use their full power to communicate guidance for how we will contain and mitigate this epidemic behind the wall.” “Specifically, do they have access to testing? Secondly, has anyone tested positive, and what are the quarantine measures? Again given the overpopulating and the fact that many of these facilities are already subpar and that incarcerated men and women do not have access to soap, to alcohol-based hand sanitizers — and to regular showers, what is the guidance for those incarcerated and for staff? And that the B.O.P. Use their full powers, I think now would be the time to commute some sentences, to exact clemency and to take care of our most our vulnerable. Ten percent of those incarcerated are over the age of 60 and already have an underlying condition.

"The Pentagon has halted all domestic travel for troops, Defense Department civilians, and their families assigned to bases and other facilities within the U.S. and its territories, beginning March 16 through May 11, in order to halt the potential spread of the coronavirus, the department announced Friday. That domestic travel includes permanent change of station (PCS) — or moving to a new assignment, and temporary duty (TDY) — temporary assignments in different locations, the Pentagon said in a statement on Friday. Troops will be authorized local leave only. The restriction will also pause civilian hiring at Defense Department installations and components for persons who did not reside within the hiring entities’ local commuting area. Exceptions may be granted for compelling cases where the travel is mission-essential, for humanitarian reasons, or warranted due to extreme hardship, the Pentagon said. Approval would have to come from a combatant commander, a service secretary, the Pentagon’s chief management officer, or the director of the Joint Staff, but could be delegated. Also beginning Friday, the Pentagon building located in Arlington, Virginia, raised its health protection condition from low to moderate, or “Bravo,” and began implementing additional protective measures that would dramatically cut the number of visitors to the building as well as its supporting facilities. The measures apply to those who do not have swipe-access cards to the building already. The Pentagon is also implementing minimal staffing, by having personnel telework or rotate beginning on Monday. A senior defense official told reporters on Saturday during a conference call: Over the last few weeks we’ve been testing our ability to move our personnel on to telework and starting Monday, many offices will voluntarily go to minimal staffing. This may involve additional telework as well as rotating staffing — red and blue teams to limit cross interaction. Officials said individual offices are making decisions about what functions can be performed via telework and what must be performed at the workplace. Those who need to access classified materials for mission-essential functions will still come into the workplace, they said. In addition, visitors without access — including international partners and visitors — are also restricted. The Pentagon has also canceled all public Pentagon tours, major events, retirement ceremonies, promotion ceremonies, and swearing-in ceremonies. The Pentagon’s gym is also closed, as well as some of the Defense Department’s other gymnasiums. Access to the Pentagon’s retirement homes is also restricted, due to the coronavirus’s heightened risk to the elderly population. Access has also been restricted for Pentagon employees — government civilians or contractors — who have been overseas recently, particularly in one of the Level 2 or 3 countries as defined by the Center for Disease Control. Those employees should self-isolate for 14 days. Currently, ten service members have tested positive for coronavirus world-wide, but there is no information indicating that any of them had come into the Pentagon.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.","Pentagon Orders 60-Day Domestic Travel Restrictions for Troops, Employees, Families",2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/pentagon-orders-60-day-domestic-travel-restrictions-for-troops-employees-families/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House announced on Saturday evening. “Last night after an in-depth discussion with the President regarding COVID-19 testing, he elected to proceed. This evening I received confirmation that the test is negative,” White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a statement released via White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. “One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free. I have been in daily contact with the CDC and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation.” The announcement comes hours after President Trump revealed at a press briefing addressing his administration’s latest measures to combat the coronavirus that he underwent testing for the deadly illness and that the results were pending. “I also took the test last night, and I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking, ‘Did I take the test?’” he told reporters. Vice President Mike Pence announced at the briefing that the United States to expanding its European travel ban to include the United Kingdom and Ireland and that it will take effect at midnight on Monday. “Americans in the U.K. or Ireland can come home. Legal residents can come home. But as the secretary will detail, they will be funneled through specific airports and process,” he explained. President Trump took the test after dining at Mar-a-Lago last weekend with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, who tested positive for the coronavirus. On Friday, Bolsonaro tested negative for the disease that originated in Wuhan, China. Earlier Saturday, the White House began conducting temperature checks for reporters “in close contact” with President Trump or Vice President Pence. “Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere confirmed in a statement. McClatchy White House correspondent Francesca Chambers reported that “around 11:30 am a man in a suit with a no contact thermometer came through the White House press briefing room and workspaces, taking the temperature of reporters in the building.” As of Saturday, 2,400 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus and 50 people have died from the illness, reports the New York Times.",White House: Donald Trump Tests Negative for Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/white-house-donald-trump-tests-negative-for-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Republicans face a political “extinction event” if they are viewed as blocking economic relief to Americans financially harmed by the coronavirus outbreak, warned economist Alan Tonelson, founder of the economics and public policy website RealityChek, during a Friday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin. Mansour asked what policy measures could assist contractors and others in the “gig economy.” “I think [emergency relief packages] will help and in this regard — I think that Congress’s Republicans are simply going to have to hold their noses and vote for a bill that contains a great many programs that in normal times they understandably wouldn’t like, because these aren’t normal times.” Tonelson added, “It seems very clear to me that Republicans and conservatives faced a genuine extinction event back in 2007 and 2008, when not only didn’t they anticipate a truly menacing housing and credit bubble that was building up that various others were warning about, but when those bubbles burst they seemed paralyzed because of this extreme anti-government ideology that had swept over the entire party and nearly the entire conservative movement.” LISTEN:  Tonelson continued, “It’s almost like the way that Republicans failed to react to the Great Depression back in 1929, ’30, ’31, when they also faced something of an extinction event because they simply couldn’t get off that ideological diet.” “There’s no doubt that this House Democratic bill is also full of a lot of items that have nothing to do with the virus,” Tonelson cautioned, “but if the Republicans don’t want to be branded as public enemy number one, again, they’ve got to swallow their pride, they’ve got a swallow their ideology, and get with this program.” Asked about a payroll tax holiday’s utility to contract employees who are unemployed due to the coronavirus’s economic fallout, Tonelson estimated, “[A payroll tax holiday] might help them in one sense. It might help them in that their employers might be able to carry them on their payrolls, even though, again, I realize that that these are part-time contracting jobs, but they might be able to to come to some arrangements with them to keep money flowing to them without going bust themselves.” Tonelson continued, “But I do think that because these jobs are so irregular, some kind of direct government income support is going to be needed. Maybe it would be some kind of tax holiday for individuals. It could take any number of forms, and I don’t think it’s especially important what exact form it takes. What’s important is that Washington moves now and gets that money flowing.” Mansour asked about a temporary “universal basic income” measure to provide financial relief to Americans economically damaged by the coronavirus’s impact. “Certainly conservatives and small government types are not crazy [about this],” replied Tonelson, “[they] fear that these kinds of temporary programs could too easily become permanent programs, but frankly, that’s a problem for down the road. We have to get past this, what I think will be a short- or medium-term crisis, and conservatives and Republicans cannot afford to be depicted, rightly, as standing in the way, even if they don’t have the votes in the House, which they clearly don’t.  American workers are not to blame for the coronavirus outbreak, Tonelson stated. “The value of individual responsibility — which conservatives rightly prize and which everybody else should prize more — it just doesn’t apply now,” determined Tonelson. “This is not these workers’ fault. They’re not in this predicament because of some personal failing, [or] because they themselves didn’t uniquely didn’t anticipate this virus.

"After failing to verify the account of Republican congressional candidate Anna Paulina Luna, despite a pledge to proactively verify all congressional candidates, Twitter went even further by temporarily restricting her account earlier this week. The restriction occurred shortly after she retweeted a post from Diego E. Arria, a critic of Venezuelan socialism who was formerly the country’s permanent representative to the UN, and president of the UN Security Council. The tweet featured a picture of Luna, a U.S. air force veteran, wearing her military uniform along with a rifle and a sidearm. The tweet is currently flagged as “sensitive content” by Twitter.

Twitter is aware that Luna is a congressional candidate. The platform has said it will verify all primary candidates in U.S election races this year, provided they have a Ballotpedia page — which Luna does. Despite being notified numerous times by Luna’s campaign, Twitter still has not verified her account — and is now being locked out of it for reasons Twitter won’t publicly explain. Twitter has not commented on why Luna’s account has not been verified, or why Arria’s tweets were labeled “sensitive.” In a comment to Breitbart News, Luna alleged that Twitter was tacitly assisting the socialist regime of Venezuela by censoring Arria, one of its most prominent critics. “Twitter has activity chosen to promote socialist politicians and censor those who believe the best form of government is a constitutional republic. Maduro is a dictator who has hurt many people and destroyed Venezuela.” “By Twitter censoring myself & the former UN Security Council President simply because he was promoting my campaign as a Republican to the people of Venezuela is alarming. I lost many three friends during my time in the military.

"CNN and other media outlets are accusing President Trump of lying when he said that Google is developing an app to help those who have potentially contracted the Wuhan Coronavirus get tested. “Google is going to develop a website — it’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past — to determine if a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” President Trump said at a press conference yesterday. “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They have made tremendous progress.” CNN is now implying that the President’s comments are fake news. “Google will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference,” claimed CNN. “Instead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients.” It is true that the triage app is being launched by an Alphabet subsidiary, Verily, but many people still use “Alphabet” and “Google” interchangeably. YouTube, for example, is still widely described as a “Google-owned company,” despite the fact that it is now technically owned by Alphabet, which was set up by Google executives in 2015 as part of the tech giant’s corporate restructuring. In a tweet, Google confirmed that Verily is working on a triage app that will first be trialed in California. “We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing,” said the statement. “Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time. We appreciate the support of government officials and industry partners and thank the Google engineers who have volunteered to be part of this effort.” Google’s statement that it hopes to expand the tool more broadly over time is not as optimistic as Trump’s claim that it will be “very quickly done.” But in all other regards, it confirms Trump’s statement — the tech giant is working on a screening tool, it is being supported by government officials in its efforts, Google engineers have volunteered to work on it (it’s unclear if the number is 1,700) and it does hope to make the tool broadly available. In a statement to CNN, the White House reiterated that it is working with Google on the screening tool. “The Trump administration is working with Google to develop a website Americans can go to determine whether a test is needed and, if so, facilitate testing at a nearby location. We expect to have more details in the days ahead.” Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.",Media Accuses Trump of Fake News over Google Screening Tool Claim,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/03/14/media-accuses-trump-of-fake-news-over-google-screening-tool-claim/,Breitbart
"National pro-life leaders praised President Donald Trump and his administration for rejecting proposals to the coronavirus supplemental bill that would force American taxpayers to fund abortion. .@realDonaldTrump thank you for not allowing the abortion industry to use #Coronavirus relief to push for taxpayer-funding of abortion! — Kristan Hawkins (@KristanHawkins) March 14, 2020  On Friday night, Trump announced his support for the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to assist Americans affected financially by the spread of the coronavirus. Trump had initially expressed his opposition to the bill, stating it had too many unrelated “goodies” that Democrats were trying to stuff in the bill. On Thursday, the Daily Caller reported that White House officials indicated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to ensure a Hyde Amendment loophole was included in the economic stimulus bill. The Hyde Amendment is a longstanding provision applied to spending bills that states taxpayer monies will not be used to fund abortions. According to the report, a White House official said Pelosi tried to lobby for a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which would not have the Hyde Amendment protections applied. The official reportedly stated A new mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented. Under the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion—which is not only backwards, but goes against historical norms. Planned Parenthood attacked the concern that taxpayer funds would be used for abortions as a result of the coronavirus spending bill. The abortion giant complained: Using this very real public health emergency to attack abortion coverage shows a despicable lack of concern about the severity of this crisis.

"The federal government is directing nursing homes to bar visitors amid the coronavirus epidemic, President Donald Trump said in his March 13 press conference. A key tactic is “breaking chains of transmission between people,” Trump said in his Rose Garden speech amid a bevy of business leaders in the retail and medical sectors. “We’ve issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places but in particular nursing homes,” he said, adding: The risks to young and healthy Americans remain very low. So we’ve learned a lot about this over the last two weeks. Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions, and those who are most at risk. They have not done very well. … Especially if they have a health problem, they have not done well. We must take all precautions and be responsible. “As you get older, your immune system is not as potent as it is when you were young,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the press event. He continued: When you talk about even influenza — which we have extraordinary experience with over decades and decades — the people who are very vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlying conditions. The same thing holds true for a variety of other disease: Why cancer is more prevalent mostly in older individuals [is] because the immune system that screens for it is less robust. So it really is something that is kind of well-known over a lot of studies. Data from China reportedly shows very low death rates from people younger than 50. But the death rates among people older than 70 hit 9.8 percent, while the people older than 80 suffered an 18 percent death rate, or almost one-in-five. Roughly 30 million Americans are older than 70. Business Insider reported March 11: Before the coronavirus hit the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, 120 seniors lived there. Now there are fewer than 50. The long-term care facility, about 20 minutes north of Seattle, has been battling a coronavirus outbreak for weeks.

"During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) laid out policy priorities for combatting the coronavirus, such as allowing people to obtain testing without cost, guaranteeing two weeks of paid sick leave to all employees, and providing protective gear to healthcare workers. Transcript as Follows: “Hi, I’m Senator Patty Murray from Washington state. Right now I know families in my state and across the country are alarmed by the continued spread of the novel coronavirus. Like so many of the families I’m hearing from, I have been incredibly frustrated and concerned by the Trump Administration’s missteps and slow response to this crisis so far. People need the facts. They need a plan. They need transparency. And they need it now. So I’m working to make sure we not only hold the Trump Administration accountable for the delays and missed opportunities so far, but that we also do everything in our power to immediately take the steps we need to do to start to finally get ahead of this crisis. I know so many people are asking what they should be doing to help keep their family and community safe. The most important thing we can do right now is make sure each and every one of us is taking steps to slow the spread of this virus so we can protect the people who are most vulnerable and prevent a spike in cases from overwhelming our health care workers on the frontlines. Public health experts have made clear this is something everyone can, and must, play a role in. There are several simple, straightforward steps you can take starting right now to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases: avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth and avoid close contact with people who are sick; clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, and throw that tissue in the trash; wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; and if you are sick—stay home. We should also all be taking steps to improve social distancing to protect ourselves and others in our communities. Now these steps may seem small—but make no mistake, they are a critical part of this fight. The other critical part of this effort is ensuring we’ve got a coordinated, comprehensive government response that puts the needs of families, workers, and communities on the frontline of this crisis first. Here are the next steps Democrats believe are necessary. First, we need to make sure that no matter how you are insured, or whether you are insured—you can get testing at absolutely no cost. We need to ensure all employees have access to fourteen paid sick days immediately, so they can afford to follow the CDC’s advice and stay home if they are sick. Our health care workers need protective gear to keep them safe as they care for those who are sick. And we need to make sure our schools have plans for everyone who will be impacted by the difficult decisions they may have to make. Children who rely on school for nutritious meals, college students who get their housing, medical care, and meals on campus will need our support. We also have to support our communities in addressing the needs of people experiencing homelessness and those experiencing food insecurity. And, as coronavirus continues to impact our small businesses, we will absolutely need to put policies in place that help local economies recover. There is much more we need to do as well—but steps like these will go a long way toward saving lives and reducing the impact of coronavirus—and we need to take them as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we’re going to keep pushing to get done. Let me also say that I know this is a frightening time, and there are lots of unknowns. But here are two things you can count on: First, you can make a huge difference for yourself and others by following public health experts’ guidance on ways to slow the spread of this virus. Small steps truly do save lives in this moment. And secondly, Democrats understand the urgency of this moment in no uncertain terms—and we are going to work to do everything we can, as fast as we can, to protect you, your loved ones, and all our communities. We are in this together, and we will get through it together.

"Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton is walking back her claim, made last week, that the state has 100,000 people who have the coronavirus. Screenshot/Johns Hopkins coronavirus website According to medical experts tracking the virus, there are currently 153,523 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide.  Confirmed cases in Ohio total 14, with no deaths reported. “I am not saying there are absolutely for certain 100,000 people, I’m saying I’m guesstimating,” Acton said at a news conference on Friday, according to the Hill. Acton drew swift reaction on Thursday when she said at a press conference with Gov. Mike DeWine that she estimated there were 100,000 people in Ohio with coronavirus, based on the fact that the virus is spreading in the community. Acton said at the time: We know now, just the fact of community spread, says that at least 1 percent, at the very least, 1 percent of our population is carrying this virus in Ohio today. We have 11.7 million people. So the math is over 100,000. So that just gives you a sense of how this virus spreads and is spreading quickly. The Hill reported on the controversy: Tara Smith, a professor of public health at Kent State University, said Friday she thinks Acton’s number is “too high,” but said that there could be 1,000 undetected cases in Ohio right now. On Friday at the press conference, Acton said once there is better data, modelers would go back and see if she was right. “As modelers far smarter than I am put that together, we’ll look back at this and we’ll see where we were,” Acton said.

"MADRID (AP) – Spain´s government is set to announce Saturday that it is placing tight restrictions on movements and closing restaurants and other establishments in the nation of 46 million people as part of a two-week state of emergency to fight the sharp rise in coronavirus infections. The Associated Press has access to the draft of the battery of measures that Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will announce in a nationally televised address. According to the draft of the government order, people will only be allowed to leave their homes to buy food and medicine, commute to work, go to medical centers and banks, or take trips related to the care for the young and the elderly. Those limitations will take hold at Monday at 8:00 a.m. Effectively immediately, Spain is also closing all restaurants, bars, hotels, education centers nationwide, and other non-essential retail outlets, a move some of the hardest-hit communities have already carried out. The government said that the official measures to be taken are open to last-minute changes before the prime minister details them in his address. Health authorities in Spain said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people, half of them in the capital, Madrid. That represents a national increase of over 1,500 in 24 hours. Lancet Editor-in-Chief: Boris #Coronavirus Strategy 'A Grave Error' https://t.co/BXLJefIIb0 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Sánchez acknowledged on Friday that the number of infections could reach 10,000 in the coming days. Spain has followed Italy´s path in implementing a similar lockdown after both European countries failed to contain the virus in regional hotspots. Italy extended the strict restriction on movement from the north to the entire country on March 9 when it registered over 9,000 infections. It then went further on March 11 and closed all retail outlets except some supermarkets and pharmacies. Already in Spain, residents in Madrid and northeast Catalonia awoke Saturday to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities the day before. The decision by prime minister Sánchez comes after some regions of Spain with viral clusters had taken steps to close restaurants and other non-essential establishments. The regional leaders of Madrid and Catalonia had also asked for the central government to help tighten the screws on transport and restrict the circulation of people. The normally bustling streets of Spain´s two biggest cities were noticeably quieter as the message sinks in that social distancing is the only way to stop the global pandemic after its eruption in China. “We had to close and remain shut for 15 days,” restaurant owner Rachel Paparardo said in Barcelona, Catalonia’s largest city. “But this is nothing, it is just so more people don´t get infected and we can recover from this.” Spooked shoppers packed some supermarkets early in the morning despite calls for calm from authorities and supermarket owners. In the capital, however, the town hall was forced to close parks after many people continued their Saturday morning jogs and other outdoor pastimes. “I live in the city center and I like to see it empty,” said Madrid resident Carmen Melon. “I like to see that I think people are being responsible and the people who have to stay at home are doing it. Today I have to work, just one hour, but later I will stay home too.” Authorities and public health care workers, as well as television and radio news anchors, are making pleas for people to stay at home in order to reduce the spiking contagion curve. Authorities in parts of southern Spain have also blocked access to coastal areas in an attempt to stop people who had taken advantage of the closing of schools this week and “work from home” options to take impromptu beach trips. A state of emergency allows the central government to limit free movement, legally confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals. It’s only the second time that the government has evoked it since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

"An Obama-appointed federal judge blocked a Trump administration rule that would have tightened work requirements for food stamps, citing the coronavirus pandemic as the reason she made her decision. D.C. District Court Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell granted a preliminary injunction blocking the recent Trump administration rule on food stamps, which the USDA estimates would have reduced federal spending by $7.9 billion over five years and gradually weaned 755,000 people off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program in charge of food stamps. “Especially now, as a global pandemic poses widespread health risks, guaranteeing that government officials at both the federal and state levels have flexibility to address the nutritional needs of residents and ensure their well-being through programs like SNAP, is essential,” Howell wrote in her ruling, according to HuffPost. A 14-state coalition, two major cities, and the Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia have all sued the Trump administration over its rule to stop states from providing food stamps to long-term unemployed residents. Under the “able-bodied” provision in the rule, Americans who are not caring for a dependent younger than six years old would only be eligible for food stamps if they are employed or enrolled in a workforce training program. “The waivers that the Rule curtails are critical to ensuring access to food for low-income people who live in areas with limited employment opportunities,” read the complaint filed by the 14 states and New York City and Washington, DC. “If implemented, the Rule will have a drastic impact on Plaintiffs and their residents by depriving between 688,000 and 850,000 vulnerable Americans of much-needed nutritional assistance.” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said last year that this rule laid “the groundwork for the expectation that able-bodied Americans re-enter the workforce where there are currently more job openings than people to fill them.” However, while the Trump administration’s initial rule meant to cut the number of food stamp recipients, President Donald Trump struck a deal with House Democrats that included paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing, and money for food stamps, the Washington Post reported.

And very accurate, I think.” Overall, the president stressed the “overriding goal” of stopping the spread of the virus and helping “all Americans impacted by this.” Sanders, meanwhile, has been delivering near-daily updates on the coronavirus and using the opportunities to plug his vision for a universal health care system. “Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,” Sanders said on Thursday, making similar remarks on Friday. “Poll after poll already shows us that the American people understand that we must do what every other major country on earth does, and that is to guarantee health care to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege,” he said on Friday. “As we begin to see the failures and vulnerabilities of the current health care system, my guess is that those numbers, and the demand for universal health care, will only go up,” he added:",Bernie Sanders Calls for Construction of ‘Emergency Housing’ over Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/bernie-sanders-calls-for-construction-of-emergency-housing-over-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"The coronavirus is an economic emergency. But it does not have to become an economic catastrophe. It is very likely to push us into a recession, if it has not already. The signs of economic contraction are plain enough to see: major sports and cultural events have been canceled, airlines have curtailed their flights and been swamped with cancellations, Apple stores are closing, schools and museums are shuttered, movie productions are halted, the stock market has had its worst two weeks since the financial crisis, and you have very likely already canceled that trip you had planned for spring break. Nothing else needs to happen for the economy to slip into recession. That’s why I say we may already be in one. To some, it will seem extraordinary that the economic impact could be so severe even though we only have a few thousand confirmed cases of coronavirus. But the social distancing we are undertaking to limit the toll of the virus on human lives entails a huge downturn in our economic activity. On a society-wide basis, we’re suddenly buying less and working less. Demand and supply are falling. It has been thrilling to watch the people of our shining Republic rise up in a largely spontaneous and voluntary social movement to contain the virus. Businesses have voluntarily told workers to stay home, sports leagues have sacrificed profits for public health, landlords in New York are promising to forego foreclosures, colleges have taken instruction online, churches are taking measures to avoid becoming vectors of infection, and families have adopted infection-fighting hygiene regimes. All without orders from governmental authorities. America has always been a rugged nation of people determined to improve our lot. And one thing that has been clear these past two weeks is this: we still got it. Right now we stand at the economic crossroads. It’s a time for choosing. Down one path, we allow the economic emergency to become an acute crisis. People who lose their jobs–and that’s inevitable given what has already happened–will stop spending on all but the necessities, struggle to live off all-too-meager savings and pragmatically skinflint jobless benefits meant to spur them back to work at the earliest opportunity. That will ripple through the economy, triggering more layoffs, more businesses closing, and even less economic activity. Think of this as stage one of the economic infection. To take just one quick and obvious example: all the weddings planned for the next two months are being canceled. Couples are putting off one of the biggest days of their lives because of the virus. This has a potentially enormous impact on them and also on our economy. The florists, caterers, and people running event spaces are losing their incomes and jobs. Travel arrangements are canceled, so are hotel reservations, dinner reservations, honeymoon plans–and that will cost many hardworking Americans their jobs. And just as the rational response to the virus means that behavioral changes go much broader than infection, the rational responses to the coronavirus economic emergency will be much broader than the frontline cost to the economy. People who are still working will pull back on spending to save their income for the bad times ahead, investment funds will flee risk assets for safe assets, and new business plans will be put on hold until we recover. Since every dollar spent into the U.S. economy is someone’s income, lower spending means lower incomes.  This path of rational fear threatens to push us into severe recession territory. Stage two of the economic infection gets very bad, very quickly. We panic save ourselves into poverty. Remember when Disney shuts down its productions, the guys holding the boom mics lose their jobs and their incomes. When Broadway’s theaters close, the guys with hammers and nails who build sets are out of work. Contractors lose jobs because people drop home improvement plans. Waitresses can’t collect tips from empty diners. Factories get fewer orders for appliances, machinery, cars, and workers get hours cut. Some lose their jobs. College kids get job offers rescinded because companies need to rein in their spending when sales decline. Though no fault of their own, and without much warning, American families get thrown into crisis. This is not something that is going to happen to strangers. It’s going to happen to your friends, your neighbors, your coworkers, and the people in your church’s pews. It’s going to happen to you if we choose to go down the path of coronavirus catastrophe. Fortunately, there’s another path. For all the surprise and shock that many of us are experiencing at the idea that our economy and society can be derailed by disease–it feels like we’ve been thrown back into the pre-modern Dark Ages–the coronavirus gives us economic policy advantages we rarely have: we know exactly what the problem is, we can see it happening right in front of us, and it is not due to excesses that need to be wrung out of the system through liquidations and rearrangements of the economy. This isn’t a dot com bubble, it’s not the mortgage bubble, it isn’t some inflationary spiral we need to stem. In other words, we know what’s happening. Even better: we know what to do about it. We need to put cash into the hands of the American people as quickly as possible. I propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending. This will not stop all the job losses but it will make them less painful. More importantly, it will make it far less likely that we go from stage one to stage two. It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects. We could accomplish much of this through a payroll tax cut but that becomes less likely to be effective every day because it only helps the working. A week ago, I told the Trump administration that this would be a crucial and effective measure. But now the cost of social distancing has become even clearer and I am convinced this would not be adequate. You can’t cut the payroll tax of someone who gets cut from the payroll. And, in any case, the House Democrats we need to pass any emergency measures have rejected the sort of payroll tax cut they fought for when Obama was president. What we need to do now is just start cutting checks for everyone. We need to go deep and broad. The checks go out to hardworking American families who have jobs, workers who lose their jobs, stay at home moms and dads, young people, and old. And, yes, even some of the deadbeats who do not really deserve them. But that latter category is pretty damn small and paying off a few undeserving people is a small price to pay for stopping the economic ruin threatened by coronavirus. There will be some who would prefer to see the government attempt to raise demand in the economy by engaging in big public works projects such as repairing our ailing infrastructure. We do not have time for that. Nothing is shovel ready. And it would fail to get the cash where it needs to be: in the hands of American households all over the country. Others will worry about the precedent set by a huge program of government “handouts.” But the usual objections to such things do not apply here. There’s no moral hazard risk, no rewarding people for bad behavior, or socializing the costs of risks undertaken for private gain. This isn’t the launch of a big government spending program or a new welfare system. It’s just a temporary series of cash payments that the private sector will be free to use as it chooses. Instead of big government, American families will decide what to do with the cash. If it helps, think of this as a refund on the taxes we’ve paid all these years that have helped build our government into one of the few institutions in the world that can undertake this kind of spending in an economic emergency. Can we afford it? The financial markets have already delivered the answer and it is an emphatic “yes.” Interest rates are incredibly low. Long-term rates are the lowest they have been in the history of our country. We have plenty of “fiscal space” to borrow right now. There’s no reason to fear deficit spending now. Just as it makes sense to refinance your mortgage and withdraw some equity if cash is tight and rates are low, it makes sense to borrow now to support the economy. This is something like a cash-out refinancing of the American economy. It’s rare that an economic emergency comes with so much warning and with such an obvious remedy. We know what needs to be done and we know it needs to be done now. History will look back on us as the generation that took a stand against the coronavirus or the generation that let it bring us down. I say we take our stand.",Carney: How To Respond to the Coronavirus Economic Emergency,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/14/carney-how-to-respond-to-the-coronavirus-economic-emergency/,Breitbart

"A law firm that employs Joe Biden’s brother as a top adviser is demanding billions from China in a class action suit over coronavirus. The Berman Law Group, which employs Francis, or Frank, Biden as a “senior adviser,” on Friday “filed a federal class action lawsuit against the People’s Republic of China, Hubei Province, the City of Wuhan, and several Chinese government ministries, on behalf of residents and businesses in the United States and the State of Florida,” according to a news release from the firm. The lawsuit, which was filed in Florida, “seeks billions of dollars in compensatory damages for those who have suffered personal injuries, wrongful deaths, property damage and other damages due to China’s failure to contain the COVID-19 virus, despite their ability to have stopped the spread of the virus in its early stages.” It is not clear how the firm calculated the amount of damages demanded from the communist regime. “This is an ambitious complaint against a world super-power,” Russell Berman, co-founder of the firm, said in the news release. “But, as we have alleged, China has unleashed a pandemic upon the world, and the harm is now exponentially multiplying every day here in the U.S. and Florida — our firm isn’t afraid to take them on and get the justice that is deserved. It is the Chinese government that should be paying damages for economic stimulus to the United States not the American People.” A staffer for the presidential campaign of Frank’s brother recently said President Trump “decided” to let coronavirus get “out of hand” in the U.S. It is not clear if that allegation will weigh against the accusations made by the Berman Law Group. The firm hired Frank Biden in 2018, according to an announcement on its website. Berman said Biden was “highly regarded in the business and government sectors.” He is featured with three other stern-faced fellows on the front page of the firm’s website. In seeking victims to represent in the suit against China, the firm states, “The Berman Law Group looks forward to fighting for the rights of people and businesses across Florida and the rest of the country, who are now becoming sick or caring for loved ones, dealing with financial calamity, and navigating this new world of panic and social distancing and isolation.” Peter Schweizer, Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute president, details in his latest investigative work, Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, Frank Biden’s history of shady business dealings. As Breitbart News reported: Frank Biden first set his sights on the region in 2009, as the Obama administration began to repair the U.S. relationship with Costa Rica. Tensions between the two countries flared under President George W. Bush, most notably on how to deal with drug trafficking. When President Barack Obama entered the White House, he set out to mend fences in the region in hopes of inaugurating a new era of global cooperation. Leading the charge on that front was Joe Biden, who had long standing ties to the region from his tenure leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Shortly after the new administration took office, Frank Biden began scouting real estate opportunities in Costa Rica. A lawyer by training, Frank was undeterred by his lack of background in international development and decades old legal troubles at home. As Schweizer notes, despite the professional and personal handicaps, business opportunities were plentiful for Frank, especially after his brother paid a visit to the country. “Costa Rica News announced a new multilateral partnership ‘to reform Real Estate in Latin America’ between Frank Biden, a developer named Craig Williamson, and the Guanacaste Country Club, a newly planned resort,” Schweizer wrote. “In real terms, Frank’s dream was to build in the jungles of Costa Rica thousands of homes, a world-class golf course, casinos, and an anti-aging center.” According to Schweizer, Frank Biden also capitalized on the school choice movement by building charter schools. An educational option, incidentally, Joe Biden recently said he would eliminate. “He realizes is that there’s not much money to be made in running charter schools. The money is to be made in the real estate of charter schools. So basically he gets involved with investors, they buy properties, and then they lease these to charter schools. And charter schools, using taxpayer money, are essentially paying off their leases,” Schweizer told Breitbart News Daily. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) is experiencing a double-digit lead in Ohio just days before the state’s March 17 primary, an Emerson College/Nexstar Poll released on Friday showed. The survey, taken March 11-12, 2020, among 464 “very” likely Democrat primary voters, showed Biden taking a comfortable lead in the Buckeye State, with 57 percent support to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 35 percent support — a 22 point advantage. While the majority of respondents, 78 percent, indicated that they will “definitely” vote for who they chose, over one-fifth of voters said they made their decision within the last week. Per Emerson: Forty-one percent (41%) of voters say they made up their mind about who to support in the primary over a month ago, 28% say they had decided in the last month, 21% decided sometime in the last week, 7% in the last three days, and 4% say they had decided just today. Voters who made their decision in the last week have split 67% for Biden, and 23% for Sanders. Voters who made up their minds in the last month are leaning towards Biden at 58% to Sanders at 39%, and voters who made up their minds before that are for Biden at 46% and for Sanders at 47%. The margin of error is +/- 4.5 percent. Ohio, which offers 136 delegates, is one of four states holding elections on Tuesday.

"Grandpa Joe Biden wants to run the country and save us from coronavirus when he can’t even run a livestream and has no idea what year it is. On Friday, Grandpa Joe held what his campaign billed as a “virtual town hall” in Illinois. In my colleague Kyle Olson’s must-read reporting on the event, you will discover the whole thing was a fiasco, like something out of a sitcom. Guests appeared and then disappeared. The sound was garbled. People were introduced, followed by an awkward pause when they didn’t appear. Babies cried… “Biden seemed to be reading from a teleprompter, but the broadcast suffered from severe tech issues, as Biden’s words were caught in a feedback loop, muddying the whole presentation and making the candidate nearly indecipherable,” Olson reported. After starting two hours late, the fiasco lasted about 45 minutes. For my money, this clip from The Honeymooners, where Ralph and Ed attempt to do a live television commercial, is the funniest thing ever captured on film. Sounds like Grandpa Joe just took that crown. Technical difficulties, however, are technical difficulties. That doesn’t mean those technical difficulties are not newsworthy. After all, we are talking about a major presidential campaign, about the competency, or lack thereof, of the people hand-picked by Biden to run his campaign. So it is a bit disconcerting that Joe and his staffers were unable to put on the equivalent of a video podcast, something millions of everyday Americans are able to do every day in their basements without a hitch. But what about Joe’s performance? How did the 985-yead-old Democrat frontrunner do? The media tell us that any criticism of Grandpa Joe’s mental acuity is a hoax, is fake news, is a desperate and desperately unfair personal attack… And then this happens: In a bizarre, meandering livestream put on by Joe Biden's campaign today, he forgets what year it is and when, if he doesn't lose, he would be in office. At another point, he seemingly forgets he's on a live stream and walks out of frame.

The date of the livestream was March 13, 2020. The presidential election will take place in November of  2020. The next president will be sworn in in January of 2021… Did you get that? Would you like me to type it again slower? “Even I can’t do that for another two years.” No. There are only ten months between now and the next inauguration. “…another year, between now and November.” No. There are only eight months between now and November. “…or actually January.” Why don’t we warm you up some oatmeal and see who’s guest-starring on Matlock with that nice Andy Griffith today? And then Joe shuffles off to watch Matlock while rambling on about estuaries and international species. Watch the full virtual town hall here:

"The Sanders campaign is beefing up its presence in Pennsylvania despite the widespread belief that his political revolution is losing steam. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign on Friday announced the opening of five offices in the Keystone State ahead of its April 28 primary. However “the campaign quickly warned they may not stay open for long, given a shift to more digital organizing prompted by the coronavirus pandemic,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “Pennsylvania voters have the power to move this movement forward, and we’re fighting for every vote over the next six weeks,” Sanders’ Pennsylvania state coordinator Brooke Adams said, according to the paper. Sanders, once considered the Democrat frontrunner, began to lose momentum after losing ten states to Joe Biden (D) on Super Tuesday — a happening that unfolded in the 72 hours between South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday as establishment Democrats made their moves. Sanders suffered another batch of losses during the March 10 primaries, including Michigan, the biggest prize of the night. He lost to Biden by over 16 percentage points but told supporters the following day that he would remain in the race and looked forward to debating his “friend” one-on-one on Sunday. “Today I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country, and you must speak to the issues of concern to them,” he said in his address, touting his popularity with younger generations. “You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older,” he added. The Vermont lawmaker admitted in an address on Friday that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is affecting his campaign’s ability to interact with voters in a traditional way. He said his staff is “by and large” working from home but added that it is utilizing its Internet capabilities to reach voters. He also said it is “absolutely appropriate” for local officials to follow the guidance of public health experts and postpone elections if it is in the best interest of the public health. He said: So all I would say is I think that the governors and the officials in the states that are — that have elections scheduled for Tuesday — have to balance things. Again. Rescheduling elections is not something we do lightly or should do lightly. On the other hand, at this particular moment, it’s absolutely appropriate that public officials, governors, etc. listen to public health officials. And your point is also important, to make sure that everybody that wants to vote has the right to vote and that may be the case today. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin confirmed on Friday that the state will postpone its April 4 elections for roughly two months amid coronavirus fears. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania State Rep. Kevin Boyle (D) is introducing a bill requiring officials to mail every eligible voter a mail-in ballot: PA needs to be realistic about the Apr 28 election. We don’t know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens & election workers alike. With this in mind I’m introducing a bill today to require all voters to be mailed a ballot. — Rep. Kevin J. Boyle (@RepKevinBoyle) March 12, 2020  “I think this is, unfortunately, a once-in-a-lifetime crisis that we’re facing,” he said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “If that were to unfold, you’re talking about a situation where I think it would be unrealistic to have in-person voting on April 28,” he added. He believes the legislature must move on the bill quickly and warned that, if it does not pass, “it becomes a realistic option that we don’t have a primary on April 28.”",Bernie Sanders Beefs Up Staffers in Pennsylvania as Movement Spirals,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/bernie-sanders-beefs-up-staffers-in-pennsylvania-as-movement-spirals/,Breitbart

"The editor-in-chief of The Lancet has labelled Boris Johnson’s coronavirus strategy “a grave error” and published an open letter asking for the models informing his policy to be made publicly available, along with a number of other prominent medical figures. Besides delaying local and mayor elections scheduled for this year until 2021, Johnson’s government had implemented few policies to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus as of March 13th, instead simply advising citizens to regularly wash their hands. Instead, it appears the Government wants large numbers of people to become infected with the virus, in hopes most will recover and confer “herd immunity” on the population before the coming winter, when they expect it to be more dangerous. This stands in stark contrast to policies adopted by countries such as Mongolia and Russia, which began restricting travel from China and other infected countries early — on and consequently have few cases at the present time — or the likes of South Korea and Italy, where the virus has become prevalent and the authorities are attempting to slow its spread through the imposition of strict quarantine and “social distancing” measures, in hopes this will stop their health services from being overwhelmed by too many people becoming ill all at once. Boris Johnson’s government did not suspend travel from any country stricken by the coronavirus, has not imposed mandatory testing and self-isolation for travellers, and has not banned mass gatherings, with government minister Whatley telling the BBC: “As the Chief Medical Officer said, and I have been advised, the evidence tells us that stopping mass gatherings doesn’t have a huge impact on the spread of the virus”. This approach has caused considerable disquiet — the Government has now indicated it may ban mass gatherings from next week after all — and has now come under fire from Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet — arguably the world’s most prestigious medical journal. What troubles me about the UK govt’s response to COVID-19 is its strategic objective. The goal seems to have been herd immunity, delaying urgent action to allow an epidemic to infect large numbers of people. Instead, the goal should have been to save lives. A grave error. — richard horton (@richardhorton1) March 14, 2020  “What troubles me about the UK govt’s response to COVID-19 is its strategic objective,” Dr Horton wrote on social media. “The goal seems to have been herd immunity, delaying urgent action to allow an epidemic to infect large numbers of people.

A grave error.” He also said it was a “myth” that “the public will tire of restrictions to their freedoms” — a supposition which is said to have strongly informed the models the Government is using to time its implementation of containment measures. “In fact, the public acted to socially distance, avoid mass gatherings, and work remotely ahead of govt advice,” Horton observed. “The govt has underestimated the public’s capacity to understand and act.” He has also written an open letter, published by The Times, urging the Government to make its modelling publicly available, given its strategy is “demonstrably different from most countries’ responses globally and in Europe.” “[I]t is imperative to delay and ‘flatten’ the epidemic curve to ensure the NHS can cope,” Horton’s group wrote. “This is particularly essential for the UK, which (according to OECD data) has 2.5 hospital beds per 1,000 population, behind Italy (3.2), France (6.0), and the U.S. (2.8)… [W]e request that the Government urgently and openly share the scientific evidence, data, and models it is using to inform its decisions on the [coronavirus]”, they urged. Dr Nisreen Alwan, associate professor in public health at the University of Southampton, Dr Miriam Orcutt, senior research fellow at University College London’s Institute for Global Health, Dr Anne Wilson, lecturer in epidemiology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Dr Peter Tennant, university academic fellow in health at the University of Leeds, and Devi Shridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, signed the letter alongside Dr Horton. Please read and support our letter in The Times today calling on the UK government to share the evidence, data, and models on which it is basing its policies.

"Pennsylvania state lawmaker Rep. Kevin Boyle (D) is urging his colleagues to consider his bill requiring the state to mail a ballot to every eligible voter as key businesses and industries across the United States continue to take drastic, proactive measures to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. While Pennsylvania’s primary elections are over a month away (April 28), Boyle is thinking ahead and believes the state needs to prepare for the possibility of the virus having an impact on the state’s elections. His solution is a bill that would require the state to send every eligible voter a mail-in ballot. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, his bill would “set aside $40 million for ballots to be sent in ‘postage prepaid, pre-addressed return envelopes,’” serving as a safeguard to the possibility of the cancellation of the in-person election. “PA needs to be realistic about the Apr 28 election,” he said on Thursday. “We don’t know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens & election workers alike”: PA needs to be realistic about the Apr 28 election. We don’t know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens & election workers alike.

Boyle (@RepKevinBoyle) March 12, 2020  It is extremely hard to fathom PA having in person voting on April 28. We are either going to have to go exclusively to vote by mail or push our primary date back. https://t.co/SCREu75HFS — Rep. Kevin J. Boyle (@RepKevinBoyle) March 13, 2020  Boyle called the pandemic a “once-in-a-lifetime crisis that we’re facing,” adding, “If that were to unfold, you’re talking about a situation where I think it would be unrealistic to have in-person voting on April 28.” “I think legislatively we have to move on this next week or the week after to have a primary in late April,” he told the paper. “If this bill doesn’t pass, it becomes a realistic option that we don’t have a primary on April 28.” More via the Inquirer: Pennsylvania is also having “comprehensive discussions” about the primary, including the Department of Health, the governor’s office, the General Assembly, and county officials, according to Wanda Murren, a spokesperson for the Department of State, which oversees elections. “Our focus is on best ways to protect the integrity of the election while safeguarding public health,” said Murren, pointing voters to the state’s new mail-in ballot option, which does not require an excuse for not showing up at a polling place. The news comes as the state officials consider the potential impacts the virus could have on upcoming primary elections. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin confirmed on Friday that the state is postponing its April 4 primary elections. He said in part: The health and safety of Louisiana residents is critical, and we want to do our part to prevent the spread of this highly infectious disease. One key stakeholder in our decision is our election day polling commissioners. Over half of Louisiana’s polling commissioners are over the age of 65, and the CDC warns that the older adults; people who have serious chronic medical conditions such as: heart disease, diabetes or lung disease are the people most at risk for serious illness from COVID-19. “We have requested postponing the April 4 Presidential Preference Primary and Municipal Primary until June 20 and postponing the May 9 General election until July 25,” Ardoin announced.",Pennsylvania Lawmaker Promotes Vote by Mail for Primary: Coronavirus Could Make In-Person Voting ‘Unrealistic’,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/14/pennsylvania-lawmaker-promotes-vote-by-mail-for-primary-coronavirus-could-make-in-person-voting-unrealistic/,Breitbart
"Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists, increasingly overshadowed by the coronavirus, have been discussing new and ever more desperate ways to grab attention for their next big publicity stunt. Mooted tactics include: committing suicide in public (perhaps at the UN’s next climate summit in Glasgow later this year); hunger strike to the death; painting parliament green; spraying traffic lights black; blocking every station, airport, and motorway in Britain; and “scare the fuck out of people”. These are among the actions proposed on a leaked XR discussion document titled ‘Vital Additions to Action Strategy.’ They appear in a list under the heading ‘Top Ideas from the Sessions.’ The radical ideas seem to be a response to concerns within XR that the public have grown slightly bored with or even irritated by their antics. For example, the protests in October last year when XR activists were filmed being pelted with missiles and dragged off a tube train in London by angry commuters trying to get to work, is described in XR discussion documents as “arguably problematic for the movement” and “alienating”. This, the document explains, is because “at the present time, we simply do not have the numbers needed to achieve our goals through mass civil disobedience.” Extinction Rebellion has been conducting interviews with journalists to find out which of their stunts play well with the media and which don’t. Their conclusion:  Unpopular actions were seen to alienate the public and the press. Positive, “funny” actions were overwhelmingly preferred to “doom and despair”. A major impression from the interviews was that occupying London again will generate less media interest, unless it is a) substantially bigger or b) cleverer – “sitting in the road is not enough now”. Clear targeting and creativity are seen as essential for driving us forward. There is no evidence of any XR member having actually volunteered to commit suicide or go on hunger strike in order to save the planet. And the document concedes that “highly sacrificial actions” have been vetoed up until now because of “strong pushback from the movement”. What’s clear, though, is that there are elements within Extinction Rebellion who think that suicide and similar “highly sacrificial actions” are just what the cause needs. In addition, as the Climate and Ecological Emergency becomes more dangerous every day, we must encourage more extreme actions to achieve meaningful change. This movement must not become ineffectual and forget its rebellious heart as it grows. Extreme self sacrificial actions can act as a vanguard for the movement, inspiring people in their rebellious journey and focusing the world’s attention. However, these highly sacrificial actions have suffered so far due to their lack of organisation / cohesion of message and because of strong pushback from the movement. For such high-risk actions, action design must be slick and highly considered. It also seems necessary for the movement to clearly outline in any strategy going forward, the intention to encourage more extreme action in response to genuine growing crisis so as not to face pushback from the movement as a whole every time a highly sacrificial action takes place. One of the problems XR may face, however, in their desperate attempts to ramp up the green scare narrative is the stiff competition they now face from the coronavirus pandemic.
 As more and more real people suffer and die as a result of the very clear and present danger posed by the actual virus, the public may rather lose patience with the fake news scare of man-made climate change.  he public might also begin to wonder why they ever viewed these unwashed middle-class hippies with third-rate degrees in environmentalism and poi studies with such indulgence.  ",Delingpole: Kamikaze Greenies – Extinction Rebellion Plots Suicide Stunt,2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/15/kamikaze-greenies-extinction-rebellion-plots-suicide-stunt/,Breitbart
"(AFP) — Passengers on the Golden Princess cruise liner were barred from disembarking at a New Zealand port on Sunday because of a suspected coronavirus case on board, health officials said. There were 2,600 passengers and 1,100 crew on the boat docked at Akaroa near the South Island city of Christchurch, according to the port’s cruise ship schedule. New Zealand’s director-general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said three passengers have been quarantined by the ship’s doctor. One of them has developed COVID-19 symptoms and is being treated as a suspected case. “All on board are not being allowed off the ship until results are known,” Bloomfield said. The health scare arose just three days after Princess Cruises announced it was suspending voyages worldwide for two months in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The company is allowing cruises within the last five days of their journey to complete the trip, but said cruises ongoing as of March 17 would end early at the most convenient location. Princess Cruises has already seen two of its vessels hit by the virus and quarantined: the Diamond Princess, which docked in Japan, and the Grand Princess, which docked in California. Bloomfield would not be drawn on what would happen to the Golden Princess until results of tests on the three passengers were known on Monday. The Golden Princess was already in New Zealand waters before Wellington on Saturday banned all future cruise ship arrivals until June 30 under strict new coronavirus related regulations. A New Zealand public health specialist, Brian Cox from the University of Otago, said if coronavirus was confirmed on the Golden Princess then the remaining passengers should not remain on board. Coronavirus: Cruise Ship Carrying 3,700 Quarantined After Infection Outbreak Aboard https://t.co/t4xwFLCU4q — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2020  The decision to quarantine 3,700 passengers and crew on board the Diamond Princess in Japan was heavily criticised after more than 700 people eventually tested positive for the virus. “The Japanese experience was a sad lesson that keeping people aboard such a ship just spreads the infection through a large number of people, and the boat becomes, basically, an incubator for spread of the disease,” Cox said. Removing passengers from the ship and placing them in self-isolation for two weeks was the safest option, he added, and it would be “inhumane to just turn it around and send it back”. On Saturday, New Zealand said international travellers would have to self-isolate on arrival for 14 days, with similar measures also announced by Australia on Sunday.

"Schools are being shut down. Workers are being sent home from offices. Universities are telling their students not to return to campus. Political rallies are being called off. People are staying indoors. All of these moves represent a boon for the Masters of the Universe in Silicon Valley. In the year of the pandemic, connection to the internet and to online services has never been more useful. While work-from-home arrangements, online classes, and online political activity have all enjoyed significant growth over the past decade, the Wuhan coronavirus is switching those trends into overdrive. Over the next few months, many will discover the convenience of working from home. Students will wonder why they need to fly out of their hometowns to faraway colleges when they can do everything they need from a laptop. Politicians will realize that they can reach far more people, with much less effort, by holding a virtual townhall in lieu of a rally. Unless you fail as badly as Joe Biden, this will be a plus for a candidate’s campaign. And what about elections? In Britain, local and mayoral elections have been postponed by a year because of the Wuhan Virus. That’s a nice free year in office for left-wing London mayor Sadiq Khan, but if elections being pushed back becomes the new norm, voters of all parties will start to wonder — why can’t we vote from our laptops and smartphones? There’s nothing inherently wrong with a rapid shift into the digital sphere. It may well make our lives more efficient and convenient. There’s just one problem — the technologies you’ll be using will be controlled by Silicon Valley. Voting from home may sound prudent during a global pandemic. But what if the voting software is controlled by Microsoft? Do you trust Microsoft? This is a company whose former board member, Reid Hoffman (also co-founder of LinkedIn) funded a Russian-style digital election interference campaign in the 2017 Alabama senate runoff. Virtual townhalls are great if you’re a Democrat candidate, but not so great if you’re a Republican. Then you can expect to be covertly “shadowbanned,” denied verification, have your campaign ads banned on YouTube and Facebook, and in the case of candidates like Tommy Robinson and Laura Loomer, banned from social media platforms altogether. Big Tech platforms already had a huge and growing influence on politics. With rallies and political events getting canceled, that will only increase — putting banned candidates like Loomer at a colossal disadvantage. Her campaign has already canceled a drive to collect signatures for ballot registration due to the coronavirus pandemic, opting to pay a registration fee instead. What happens when a political candidate can’t do physical campaigning or digital campaigning? Ordinary citizens who are banned from major platforms will also run into trouble. If politicians start holding townhalls using platforms like Facebook Live and Periscope, how will citizens who are banned from those platforms ask them a question? Worse, if elected officials use the big tech platforms to broadcast important information about the coronavirus or other crises — as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis did during Hurricane Dorian last year — how are citizens who’ve been banned from those platforms supposed to find out about it? If you’re staying indoors to escape a pandemic, chances are you’ll be making more online purchases than normal. If you’re self-employed, you might want to start selling your products and services online. But that becomes significantly harder if you’ve been banned from PayPal or Stripe or even denied a bank account for political reasons. With governments warning you to stay inside, you might alleviate your boredom by playing online video games. Unless XBox Live or other gaming platforms have banned you for using mean words, that is. Missing your social life? Well, at least you can use Facebook and Twitter to talk to your friends. Oh wait — unless you’re banned. Dating? Don’t worry, there are apps for that. Unless you get too political — then you’ll be banned there too. Afraid to go to the grocery store? You can order food on Uber Eats — unless Uber’s banned you for “hate speech.” Is your lecturer holding his seminars on Facebook live? Sorry, you can’t participate, Facebook’s banned you! All of this assumes, of course, that people are being banned for concrete reasons, and not due to faulty algorithms, which happens all the time. Facebook and other social media platforms sometimes correct those mistakes. Sometimes. They don’t, after all, have a massive incentive to do so — losing one user isn’t much of a financial blow, and thanks to the legal immunities of Section 230, no user has yet been able to successfully sue a platform for wrongful termination of their account. The Wuhan coronavirus could have Americans staying indoors for weeks, maybe even months. It could force us to move large parts of our everyday lives online, accelerating pre-existing trends. Except that some people, because of arbitrary and politically biased censorship from the tech giants, won’t be able to. With government turning to the private sector, including tech giants, for help tackling the crisis, perhaps the nation’s leaders will finally be forced to seriously confront the fact that for many Americans, access to digital platforms is fast becoming not merely a luxury, but an essential need. Big Tech can no longer be allowed to take it away on a whim.

"On Sunday, March 15, 2020, Breitbart News spoke with Jerry Wayne, the auto worker Joe Biden cursed as “full of shit.” Wayne told Breitbart News that after Biden cursed at him, he knew more blunders would follow, saying “I was going to let him dig that hole.” Jerry Wayne told Breitbart News he wants to hold Biden accountable for the words he says, as they related to prohibiting firearms, and he wants to do so in such a way to make it “political suicide to even mention taking one of our rights away.” On March 10, 2020, Breitbart News reported the exchange between Biden and Wayne, an interaction that began with Wayne expressing his concern that Biden planned to take guns away from Americans. Biden responded to Wayne’s concern by saying, “You’re full of shit.” But the exchange continued, with Wayne continuing to stand his ground and Biden resorting to asking Wayne if he wanted to go outside to referencing “AR-14s.” Wayne told Breitbart News that he was not shocked when Biden cursed at him. Rather, he said what shocked him was that Biden stopped to engage with him in the first place. Wayne said that once Biden cursed he know bigger blunders would follow, so he said, “I was going to let him dig that hole.” Wayne said, “As soon as he said I was full shit, I knew he was going to go back on what he said in his earlier videos. So I just wanted to let him talk, because I knew he was going to dig that hole. He did this to himself.” Later on March 10, 2020, Breitbart News reported one of the Biden videos Wayne is referencing. The video is from an August 2019 CNN interview, the Real Clear Politics transcription of which shows that Anderson Cooper asked, “So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they’re going to come for guns?” Biden responded, “Bingo. You’re right, if you have an ‘assault weapon.’ The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.” While speaking to Breitbart News, Wayne added, “I am not Democrat or Republican, I’m an American.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union” that the United States “only hope”  to stop the coronavirus outbreak is if the federal government “realizes we’re in a war and takes over the situation. Host Brianna Keilar asked, “The president made several claims on Friday that the White House later had to clarify. Are you getting clear information from the White House, from the Trump Administration?” De Blasio said, “No, Brianna, we haven’t for so long. On January 24, I held a press conference at the emergency management office, calling for the federal government to support us with localized testing. We didn’t get the ability to do localized testing until just about two weeks ago. We’re playing a huge game of catch-up in this country. Let me say it very bluntly. The federal government, at least in the last few days, has started to come alive and do something, but we are so far behind. We need massive testing all over the country, particularly in the affected areas. We need the federal government to take over the supply chain right now. Right now we have to make sure that the places in this country that need more ventilators, that need surgical masks, that need hand sanitizer, that that is a federalized dynamic where those factories that produce those goods are put on 24/7 shifts and those goods are distributed where they’re needed most as in wartime.” “Right behind that is the question of food and basic supplies,” he continued. “If the federal government r this is the equivalent of a war already, there is no way the states and localities can make all the adjustments we need to. I agree with Governor DeWine. I’ll reach across the aisle are we’re all on our own in so many ways, and I think mayors and governors are doing their best to quickly improvise, mobilize the cities, cancel elective surgeries. We cannot control the supply chain. We cannot control the foundation of where our medical supplies and equipment come from.

You do have schools close there can in Ohio for three weeks. I wonder if there’s a possibility that Ohio schools will be closed actually for the remainder of the school year. Is that possible?” DeWine said, “Absolutely. Absolutely. One, the projections—and again, this is all projections, I’m just going by what medical experts are telling us. You know, this may not peak until, you know, the latter part of April or May. We’ve informed the superintendents, while we’ve closed schools for three weeks, that the odds are this is going to go on a lot longer, and it would not surprise me at all if schools did not open again this year.” He added, “When we closed the schools, we wanted to make sure kids continue to get food so the department of agriculture gave us a waiver within 24 hours so we could take food out to kids and distribute it in different areas, and some school districts in Ohio will take that out, put it on a bus and travel around and distributing it.

"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said on Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union” that the United States could see hundreds of thousands of fatalities if we do not stop the community spread in the coronavirus outbreak. Anchor Brianna Keilar asked, “There have been estimates of hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. who could die or, in the worst-case scenario, millions. Can you tell the American people that that is possible?” Fauci said, “You know, it’s possible because when you do a model, you have a worst-case scenario, the best-case scenario, and the reality is how you react to that will depend where you’re going to be on that curve. So obviously we are clearly going to have more infections. There’s going to be more problems with regard to morbidity and mortality. The challenge we have right now is how do we blunt that. I’ve said many times if you just leave it alone and let the virus to its own devices, it will go way up and come down naturally over a period of several weeks. Unfortunately for our colleagues in Italy and France and certainly in China, that’s what happened. Our challenge right now is to do two things, is to prevent the new influx of cases, hence the travel restrictions, and for what we’re dealing with right now, is to know that we’re going to get more infections but blunt it so that we don’t have that sharp peak, so we have a smaller hump. Even with that, we’ll have people getting infected, but we need to try to get there as opposed to there.” Keilar asked, “Are you thinking that hundreds of thousands of Americans could die from this?” Fauci said, “I say that, and it sometimes gets taken out of context. We have to be realistic and honest. Yes, it is possible. Our job, our challenge, is to try and make that not happen. But to think, if we go about our daily lives and not worry about anything, that it’s not going to happen, it could happen, and it could be worse. To me, that’s a real impetus to take very seriously the kind of things. I might make a point that people sometimes think that you’re overreacting.

"A new poll by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News finds that approval of President Donald Trump remains unchanged since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, though only 48% have confidence in him to manage it. The Journal reported Sunday morning: The survey of 900 registered voters found little sign that a crisis with potential to define the 2020 election has altered the political standing of President Trump. Some 51% disapprove of how he is handling the virus outbreak, while 45% approve. That is nearly identical to his overall job-approval rating, which is essentially unchanged from last month and from much of his tenure as president. Republicans and Democrats hold nearly inverse views on his emergency response, with 81% of GOP voters saying he has done well and 84% of Democrats saying the opposite. Among independents, 43% approve and 52% disapprove. … Fewer people in the survey said they had confidence in Mr. Trump to handle the crisis than they did in various levels of government. Less than half—48%—said they had a fair amount or great deal of confidence in the president. By comparison, 62% had confidence in the federal government, 72% in local government and 75% in their state government. The outbreak has taken governments around the world by surprise, and even those that have responded aggressively have been forced to re-adjust over time. On Saturday night, for example, Israel announced a ban on gatherings larger than ten people (ten is the minimum required for a prayer quorum in the Jewish faith). The Israeli government will also follow South Korea’s example in using private cellphone data to track those exposed to the virus. Joel B.

"PARIS (AP) – France is holding nationwide elections Sunday to choose all of its mayors and other local leaders despite a crackdown on public gatherings because of the new virus. Voting stations opened just as a drastic new order came into effect shutting down all of France’s restaurants, museums, and most stores to stem the spreading coronavirus. The country has some 4,500 cases, including 91 people who have died. President Emmanuel Macron decided against delaying the elections amid concerns that would be undemocratic. But the virus is expected to sharply reduce turnout. The government ordered unprecedented sanitary measures at polling stations. Organizers are under orders to allow a one-meter (about three-foot) gap between people in lines, and to provide soap or hydro-alcoholic gel and disinfectant wipes for voting machines. Voters were told to bring their own pens to sign the voting register. Associated Press reporters observed uneven application of the rules in different polling stations. Coronavirus: France Shuts Down Cafes, Restaurants, Cinemas, Non-Essential Retail https://t.co/zW1HZyJKFY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Sunday’s elections are the first round of a two-round election for leadership of all 35,000 French communes, some of only a few dozen inhabitants. Voters will choose among lists of candidates running for mayor and town council seats. If no list gets the absolute majority in the first round, all lists that receive more than 10% of votes will qualify for the second round, currently scheduled for March 22. While most voters cast ballots based on local considerations, the elections are an important gauge of public sentiment before the 2022 presidential election. Sunday’s voting is a tough challenge for Macron’s 3-year-old centrist party, which is competing for the first time in municipal elections and still lacks local roots across France. His government is also unpopular after months of protests from the yellow vest movement against perceived social injustice, and several weeks of strikes and demonstrations against a planned pension overhaul. The conservative Republicans party, the greens party, the populist National Rally, and the struggling Socialists are also vying for key mayoral seats and to strengthen or save their nationwide political bases. The main battleground is Paris, whose mayor is an influential figure in French politics and will oversee the 2024 Olympics.

"Elderly Britons may be told to self-isolate for four months under the government’s “wartime-style” effort to combat the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. The government of the United Kingdom is expected to impose a swathe of new measures to fight the further spread of the virus and to prevent the National Health Service (NHS) from “falling over” during the peak of the epidemic. Within the next 20 days, those over the age of 70 will be told to self-quarantine in their homes or care homes for up to four months, a Government source told ITV. Boris Johnson’s government is concerned that the quarantine will lead to the death of elderly people from neglect, and will call on friends, neighbours, and relatives to help older people during their isolation. Dominic Cummings, the chief advisor to the Prime Minister, has reportedly been reaching out to Deliveroo and Uber to help bring food to the elderly, as well. “We are looking for a huge community effort,” the source said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed that the imposition of self-isolation for the elderly is in the “action plan” — but added that the Government will not enact the plan until “it is the right time to do so”. “We absolutely appreciate that it is a very big ask of the elderly and the vulnerable and it’s for their own self-protection,” he told Sky News. AP Sources: U.S. #Coronavirus Travel Ban Extended to United Kingdom, Ireland https://t.co/Jzxo3rVHHn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Aside from the quarantine of the elderly, the Government is planning to enact temporary closures of public spaces such as pubs, bars, and restaurants, as well as banning mass gatherings. The Government is also planning to requisition private hospitals, hotels, and other buildings to aid its efforts against the virus. The measures are intended to prevent the nation’s socialised healthcare system from becoming overburdened, which could lead to rationing of care  — particularly for those over the age of 65, as has already begun in Italy, the epicentre of the European outbreak of the coronavirus. “Everything is aimed at making sure the NHS is not overwhelmed, to save lives and to prevent hideous choices having to be made,” a source said. The death toll from the virus reached 21 on Saturday, and over 1,140 people have been confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, according to the BBC. Lancet Editor-in-Chief: Boris #Coronavirus Strategy 'A Grave Error' https://t.co/BXLJefIIb0 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2020  Next week the Government will introduce emergency legislation to combat the spread of the virus, giving the state the power to detain “any vehicle, train, vessel or aircraft” and the ability to close ports if there are “insufficient resources” in the event border security officials become sick, The Times reports. The emergency legislation will also empower the police to arrest and forcibly quarantine those who are sick but fail to self-isolate. “We are going to take the powers to make sure that we can quarantine people if they are a risk to public health, yes, and that’s important,” Mr Hancock said.

"CNN and other media outlets are accusing President Trump of lying when he said that Google is developing an app to help those who have potentially contracted the Wuhan Coronavirus get tested. “Google is going to develop a website — it’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past — to determine if a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” President Trump said at a press conference yesterday. “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They have made tremendous progress.” CNN is now implying that the President’s comments are fake news. “Google will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference,” claimed CNN. “Instead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients.” It is true that the triage app is being launched by an Alphabet subsidiary, Verily, but many people still use “Alphabet” and “Google” interchangeably. YouTube, for example, is still widely described as a “Google-owned company,” despite the fact that it is now technically owned by Alphabet, which was set up by Google executives in 2015 as part of the tech giant’s corporate restructuring. In a tweet, Google confirmed that Verily is working on a triage app that will first be trialed in California. “We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing,” said the statement. “Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time. We appreciate the support of government officials and industry partners and thank the Google engineers who have volunteered to be part of this effort.” Google later made their statement ever clearer: “Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information. (2/6) — Google Communications (@Google_Comms) March 15, 2020  Google’s statement that it hopes to expand the tool more broadly over time is not as optimistic as Trump’s claim that it will be “very quickly done.” But in all other regards, it confirms Trump’s statement — the tech giant is working on a screening tool, it is being supported by government officials in its efforts, Google engineers have volunteered to work on it (it’s unclear if the number is 1,700) and it does hope to make the tool broadly available. In a statement to CNN, the White House reiterated that it is working with Google on the screening tool. “The Trump administration is working with Google to develop a website Americans can go to determine whether a test is needed and, if so, facilitate testing at a nearby location. We expect to have more details in the days ahead.” Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.",Media Accuses Trump of Fake News over Google Screening Tool Claim,2020-03-14,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/03/14/media-accuses-trump-of-fake-news-over-google-screening-tool-claim/,Breitbart
"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Govs. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) both said they are considering closing down bars and restaurants to help slow down the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Host Chuck Todd asked, “Are you thinking about shutting down bars and restaurants?” DeWine said, “We’re certainly looking at that. We started off last week closing the schools. We reduced the number of people gathered together to 100. You know, we restricted access to our nursing homes, to our prisons. So we’re taking tough steps.” He added, “I  have been consulting from Dr. Amy Acton who is doing a great job as my health director, but to national experts, they say look, every day counts so much. You cannot wait. You’ve got to move very, very quickly. And look, these are tough decisions. We’re inconveniencing people, making lives change, but we have to save lives.” Pritzker said, “What I’m telling you is we have been on the trajectory now and planning for each of these steps, because it’s not easy. You can imagine each one of these decisions has consequences to them that are not just about the pandemic, they’re also about people’s livelihoods. We’re actually looking hard at that decision making today. We obviously saw what happened in Europe.

"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D-IL) said President Donald Trump’s administration had “fallen down” on the response to the coronavirus outbreak. After international U.S. airports were crowded with returning Americans, Pritzker tweeted at President Donald Trump, “since this is the only communication medium you pay attention to—you need to do something NOW.” Host Chuck Todd asked, “Let me start with what happened at O’hare. You weren’t the only airport, but every international airport seemed to have a similar situation. Dr. Fauci seemed to say that is what is going to happen when you come back into this country. What do you believe should have been done that wasn’t done.” Pritzker said, “That’s not right. I have enormous respect for Dr. Fauci, but that’s just incorrect. We knew when the president gave the orders that European travel back to the United States was going to be cut off, that there would be an influx of people, Americans and others, that would come before the final cutoff. So what should have happened? They should have increased the customs and border patrol numbers. And they should have increased the number of CDC personnel on the ground doing those checks. They did neither of those. Last night, as people were flooding into O’hare airport, they were stuck in a small area. Hundreds and hundreds of people. And that’s exactly what you don’t want in this pandemic. So we had that problem. And then today, it’s going to be even worse. There are a larger number of flights with more people coming. And they seem completely unprepared.” Todd asked, “You have not gotten any reassurance from customs officials that they’re going to have more folks on hand today?” Pritzker said, “Well, here’s what I got. I got a call at about 11:00 last night after that tweet from a White House staffer who yelled at me about the tweet. That is what I got. Now, we have been talking to customs and border patrol officials directly on the ground at O’hare. I have been working with the mayor and our senators to make sure we’re getting the federal government to pay attention to this problem because we can’t have it happen all day today.” He added, “We had to provide the leadership because the federal government has fallen down on this. They didn’t advise us to shut down events. They’re not the ones who advised us to close down schools. We made those decisions on our own. We’re on our own. I wish we had leadership from Washington.

Respirators are the health care equipment health care workers need to treat folks and ventilators because if it gets really – this is one of the things with breathing issues for those that are elderly. What are your concerns? Has the federal government stepped up enough on this front?” Slavin said, “My concern is I think we need to think about this in almost a war-like stance. My concern is that we have millions of health care workers around this country who are prepared to do battle against this virus. But I’m concerned there are at least a couple areas of supplies they need in order to fight that virus as effectively as possible. One is the testing we need, and Dr. Fauci commented on that, and I hope indeed that private labs are going to ramp up testing. We started at mass general to increase our testing as of yesterday.” He added, “The FDA relaxed its regulations so we could begin testing immediately. My other big concern is personal testing equipment. Even before the most significant battles lie ahead, our supplies are low. I heard from hospitals around our region and our country that their supplies are low. And we need the federal government to engage in a Manhattan project, to get industry to create surgical masks, eye protection devices, gowns, sore our health care workers can engage in this battle.

"Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer Rubin argued there would be fewer Democrat coronavirus deaths because they are adhering to suggestions offered by experts and the media. In contrast, she argued Republicans are skeptical and more susceptible to death from the coronavirus.
“[T]here is a particular cruelty, irony that it is their core viewers, the Republican older viewers, who are the most at risk,” she said. “And when you think about it, which party immediately canceled all of their rallies? Which party immediately started having their political figures really portray and use their lives as an example? It was the Democrats. So typically, there will be less Democrat deaths because there will be less mass gatherings. There will be less opportunities for people to congregate and share this horrible disease. So it is really a very short-sided strategy. But I think now the name of the game is how do they get back on planet earth. And part of the way that I think that they are doing it is down the memory hole. He jumped right on this right away because of all this planning that we’re doing so well, which is head-spinning for the rest of us who watched him for weeks say this is a hoax. But this is how they do it at Fox News. “And so they will contort themselves to get in line and get in sync. And, you know, we’re always saying but, but, but, pointing to the past. And they don’t. They simply move with the flow. Every day is a new day. Every day is a new storyline, and they will stick with it. I think the problem will be what happens unfortunately if we start to follow that Italian model where we have mass casualties, and our lives are not disrupted for a week or two, but we’re talking months. And that is going to be some serious stuff. And I don’t know if their brainwashing is so strong as to carry on and make excuses for Trump during that.

"An El Cerrito, California, husband shot and killed an alleged intruder Saturday as his wife and daughter hid together in the bedroom for safety. The husband said the suspect “appeared to be trying to enter the home,” El Cerrito Police Capt. Robert De La Campa told the East Bay Times. “The male resident shouted at the intruder, who did not leave. The resident felt threatened that the intruder was going to enter the home and he felt he was acting in defense of himself and his family, so he shot at the intruder,” De La Campa added. The suspect, who was in his late 20s, fled the scene after the husband shot at him. He soon collapsed and police found his body in the street. KPIX5 reported that the mother and daughter were in the house at the time of the incident, and they “huddled together” in the bedroom while the husband went to investigate the noises. Police indicated the preliminary investigation supports the claim that the suspect was “in the process of committing a burglary.” They believe this same suspect may be tied to other burglaries in the area.

"Actor Bradley Whitford says the “cultish insanity” of President Donald Trump and Republicans who support him “might very well kill us all” as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across America. The White House has stepped up its efforts against the pandemic in recent days. On Friday evening, President Trump announced a ban on all travel from Europe, pledging additional funding, and launching a new federal coordinator to oversee testing. However, many figures across the political spectrum have been critical of the administration’s response to the pandemic. One loud Hollywood leftist most unimpressed was Whitford, who accused Trump of getting every decision wrong. “In our most harrowing moment, [Donald Trump] has gotten everything wrong,” the West Wing star said. In our most harrowing moment, @realDonaldTrump has gotten everything wrong. — Bradley Whitford (@BradleyWhitford) March 15, 2020  Whitford went on to say that Trump and his supporters are merely “racist science deniers” whose actions could get the whole country killed. “This is a moment to reflect upon the fact that [Donald Trump and his enabling GOP are racist science deniers whose cultish insanity might very well kill us all,” Whitford said.

In January, he responded to an escalation of tensions with Iran by suggesting that the children of Republican politicians replace U.S. military forces and be placed into combat. Last October, Whitford also declared Trump to be a “charlatan racist sexual assaulting useful idiot of Vladimir Putin,” despite the Mueller report effectively exonerating him of collusion with Russia.

"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” New York Times columnist David Brooks criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak by claiming that he does not “feel the emotions of other people,” which he said leads him to misread the country. Host Chuck Todd asked, “David Brooks, this was after the Wednesday address, Noah Rothman wrote, ‘There’s no excuse for the kind of carelessness in a prepared address to the nation. The cumulative effect of these errors and compromise measures was to leave the nation less confident than before the president spoke.’ The president might have been better off keeping quiet, but the point is it does seem as if that lack of confidence, and you start to see it, it’s spreading with different people on how to deal with this crisis.” Brooks said, “We see it with every fall official. None can get in front of President Trump, so they all have to hang back. I had a friend, somebody I care about deeply, call me last night and say he had a fever. I had no idea what to tell him. It was very unnerving. The next instinct is, I’m going to drive up and see him, but we can’t do that either. This goes against human nature that we can’t care for our loved ones. We have a president who doesn’t feel the emotions of other people. Therefore, he can’t read the country. Six months ago, he can’t say people are really hurting. They’re afraid out there. I have to act. He lacks that sense. He’s not really seeing the country. He’s reading what people think about him, which is all he sees.

"This follow-up to my March 12 coronavirus piece comes with the same important caveats, important enough that I’m stating them up front: I’m not here to alarm anyone, and I am not here to scoff. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I do know what our experts are saying, and this is me reporting what the experts are saying. Andrew Slavitt, Barack Obama’s former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is quoting experts who say more than one million Americans are already doomed because the “virus was not contained.” “Currently experts expect over 1 million deaths in the U.S. since the virus was not contained & we cannot even test for it,” Slavitt tweeted Thursday. “The original sin is Trump’s months long denial and his dismantling of public health and response infrastructure.” Let’s be very clear about what Slavitt is saying… AT THE VERY LEAST, ONE MILLION AMERICANS WILL DIE NO MATTER WHAT WE DO NEXT In no uncertain terms, using these experts, Slavitt is saying that it is already too late to save a million Americans, and that more than one million Americans will be dead in the next 12 to 18 months. He is saying that no matter what we do to contain and mitigate, no matter what we do going forward, it is fait accompli that more than one million Americans will die and that this is all President Trump’s fault. Let’s be just as clear about who Slavitt is… He is not some crank on Twitter. He is not some paranoid in a desert mobile home screaming from ham radio. Slavitt was appointed by the president of the United States to run CMS, and he did so for nearly two years. Slavitt’s name and reputation is such that his opinion on this matter rates mentions in the Guardian, Washington Post, and New York Times. Again, as I did in a previous piece laying out these terrifying estimates from America’s experts — the experts driving media coverage and by extension the government and corporate response that effectively shut down our economy last week — I want to make clear that I’m only here to report. Slavitt also quoted experts who said that American hospitals will be overrun by March 23. “By March 23 many of our largest cities & hospitals are on course to be overrun with cases,” he wrote. SLAVITT’S SOURCE IS EVEN MORE DIRE Slavitt is quoting a report (I noted in that earlier piece) that came from an “expert panel” (those are not scare quotes, that’s what the panel is called) that released a report highlighting the following…  [emphasis is original]: … Again, I want to be precise and clear… The report amplified by Slavitt declaratively says — and I am quoting here: “Our containment efforts won’t reduce the number who get infected in the US … 40-70% of the US population will be infected over the next 12-18 months. … [T]hat’s 160M people infected. With 1% mortality rate that’s 1.6M Americans die over the next 12-18 months.” In other words, we are already past the point of no return and 1.6 million Americans are simply going to die — nothing we do now will stop 1.6 million Americans from dying. That is the best case scenario, not the worst case scenario. THE MATH AVERAGES OUT TO 3,333 AMERICAN DEATHS PER DAY  As I did with my previous piece, I want to respect these numbers, but at the same time, I want to — within the world of these numbers — be as reasonable as possible. Slavitt says the best case scenario is “over one million” dead in the next 12 to 18 months. The report says the best case scenario is 1.6 million over the next 12 to 18 months. So I am going to do the math using 1.2 million over the next 14 months. Viruses ravage a population through exponential increases — which means more and more deaths over time. There is no way for me to predict that number and it would be irresponsible of me to try. So, in order to help us wrap our minds around that number, I’m going to break the math down into a daily average. Give or take a day or three, fourteen months is 420 days. That means 1.4 million deaths works out to an average of 3,333 deaths per day. To make that number clearer, between now and June of next year, according to these experts, an average of 3,333 Americans will have died every day. CONTEXT  Again, I am not here to alarm anyone, and I am not here to scoff… But context is important, so here is some context… Worldwide, since this outbreak began about three months ago, there have been (as of this writing), 160,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths. In the United States, since the CDC began tracking these numbers in mid-January, there have been 1,629 reported cases and 41 deaths. Now go wash your hands….   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Monday discussed his recent op-ed calling on action to be taken to fight the coronavirus after seeing the pandemic hit Italy. Gingrich praised Italy’s “strong response” to shut down schools, restaurants and churches after initially responding poorly in fighting the virus. “We really need to get in the habit of telling people we want you to be physically separate but stay in touch with each other, keep your morale up, remain social — in an electronic sense, not personally,” Gingrich outlined. I think two things happened here. One is they didn’t move as fast as they should have, and this is what President Trump’s trying to react to, I think. When the first wave hit the villages, I don’t think anybody thought they would spread as fast as they did. So, that was a challenge, the government’s now reacted very strongly.” He continued, “I would say Italians are more disciplined today than I’ve ever read about since the Roman Empire. It’s remarkable. You stand outside a store at a physical distance from each other, waiting for your turn to go in the store. And by the way, their stores are not empty. They are fully loaded, they have none of these problems of empty shelves. They’ve done a very disciplined, good job of that.” Gingrich also warned the United States could look like Italy if it does not take the right precautions, saying he hopes to see the country end up being more like South Korea with how it has combatted the spread of the disease. “This is a perfect moment for preventive care,” he emphasized. “If we get ahead of this, if we take the right precautions … if you’re careful about who you’re with I think that we have every chance to be closer to South Korea and to have learned a painful lesson from Italy.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Gingrich Hopes U.S. Learns ‘Painful Lesson from Italy’ — ‘We Have Every Chance to Be Closer to South Korea’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/gingrich-hopes-u-s-learns-painful-lesson-from-italy-we-have-every-chance-to-be-closer-to-south-korea/,Breitbart
"Google’s sister company Verily recently launched a website that invites adults in northern California to answer questions about their recent health and travel that could help them to receive a free coronavirus test.

President Donald Trump previously thanked Google on Friday for developing a website to help the public determine if they needed to take a coronavirus test.

The website states that Verily is working “with the California governor’s office to direct high-risk individuals to newly-launched testing centers in San Mateo and Santa Clara” counties. Individuals showing symptoms of the virus are urged to seek medical care rather than rely on Verily’s testing system, the firm stated. Verily did not respond to requests for comment on how many users had utilized the website in its first few hours. Verily stated that people’s survey responses would be kept in an encrypted Google database, access to this database is heavily restricted and monitored according to Verily. Verily stated that the data would be shared with healthcare authorities but would never be “joined with your data stored in Google products without your explicit permission.” Verily also stated that user-submitted data would be used for research purposes only with permission but it may ask for that permission in the future. The company did face criticism for requiring users to log in with a Google account, which does open the door to data privacy concerns. The coronavirus testing website by Verily can be found here.

"President Donald Trump condemned the press for spreading “fake news” about Google’s planned Wuhan coronavirus screening tool in a press conference Sunday. The President thanked google for confirming his announcement of the tech giant’s planned screening tool on Friday, and said that the leader of Google had called him to apologize. “I want to thank the people at Google and Google communications, because as you know they substantiated what I said on Friday.” “The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, called us and he apologized.” “I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace.” The President then held up a printed copy of Google’s press release. “As you know this is from Google, they put out a release, and you guys can figure it out yourselves,” said Trump, before casually flicking the press release towards the gathered reporters. “I’m sure you’ll apologize. It would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so wonderful.”  On Friday, President Trump announced that Google is developing a screening website to help Americans determine if they’ve been infected by the Wuhan coronavirus. However, CNN then put out a report saying that Trump’s comments were inaccurate. As Breitbart News reported: CNN is now implying that the President’s comments are fake news. “Google will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference,” claimed CNN. “Instead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients.” However, Google’s press release stated that after a trial in the San Francisco Bay Area, the company is aiming to roll out the tool more broadly. “Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information. (2/6) — Google Communications (@Google_Comms) March 15, 2020  The fact that Trump referred to “Google” rather than “Alphabet” does not make his comments inaccurate, as the two corporate names — the latter referring to Google’s parent company, established during a company restructuring — are frequently used interchangeably. YouTube is still frequently described as a “Google-owned company” even though it is now technically owned by Alphabet.

"In his ongoing effort to differentiate between himself and Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden is touting background checks but ignoring the fact they do not stop mass public attackers. On Sunday night Biden tweeted: Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times.  We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures. — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) March 16, 2020  While Politifact reports Sanders “did vote against the Brady bill, including a shifting mix of background check provisions, five times,” Biden is not addressing the fact checks have proven to be no hindrance to determined, mass public attackers. In fact, nearly every mass public attackers of recent memory–going back some 12 or 13 years–acquired his guns via a background check. Here is a short list of attackers who acquired their guns via background checks: The handful of mass public attackers who did not acquire their guns via background checks–attackers like the one who struck Sandy Hook Elementary School—got their guns via thievery, so no amount of point-of-sale gun control would have stopped them. This is important at a time when Democrats in the House and Senate, and the presidential primary race, are all pushing an expansion of background checks as crucial for American safety. On February 18, 2020, Breitbart News reported a John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study showing that expanded backgrounds do not reduce the mass shooting rate. Thus, whereas Democrats are fond of pushing even more background checks as a way of stopping future attacks, Johns Hopkins study found that expanded background checks are not “associated with lower rates of fatal mass shootings.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tested negative for the novel coronavirus, he announced in a statement on Sunday evening. “I was just informed by Dr. Moynihan, the head of the House Physicians Office, that my coronavirus test was NEGATIVE,” Graham announced on social media. “I’m very grateful and like everyone else will follow the best practices to stay negative.” “I look forward to getting back to work with my Senate colleagues and President Trump to contain this virus and stabilize our economy,” he continued, thanking people for prayers and well wishes: I look forward to getting back to work with my Senate colleagues and President Trump to contain this virus and stabilize our economy.

"A southern China community neighbourhood management office offered cash rewards to citizens for slaughtering “stray” or “unleashed” dogs during the coronavirus epidemic, according to an online news report. The gruesome incentive was included in a notice issued to residents of the Wanjiang Community in Dongguan, Guangdong province, in response to complaints about irresponsible dog owners, Kankanews.com reported. While the document dealt mostly with issues such as the need for owners to have a licence for their pets and to show consideration for other residents by keeping their animals on a lead in public areas and cleaning up after them, it also included a warning. That stated any dog seen within the grounds of the compound and not on a lead would be classed as a stray. And anyone who killed a stray was entitled to claim a reward of 200 yuan (U.S.$28) – once the death had been verified by a security guard. According to the South China Morning Post, the response to the proposal has been one of utter outrage and many who saw the notice were horrified. “It’s such a barbaric rule. It’s not what a civilised society should do,” a woman was quoted as saying. “If children see this, they won’t believe that they should love animals,” another said. Widespread fears of pets being able to spread the coronavirus disease began in January after a Chinese health expert claimed animals needed to be quarantined during the outbreak to stop the spread of the disease. However, the World Health Organization dismissed the claims suggesting there is no evidence to show the virus being transmitted to pets. The notice is now being re-drafted because “its content was inappropriate”, a spokesperson from the Wanjiang community, known by his surname Long, told Kankan News. “We wanted to regulate keeping pets. We are not encouraging killing dogs,” Long added. China’s relationship with “man’s best friend” has always been one of complexity with it being both a pet and something to be eaten. As Breitbart News reported,  the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen last month wanted local restaurants to take dogs and cats off their menus as the country clamped down on the wildlife trade scientists suspect led to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Reuters reports a new city regulation stated only nine meats that are permitted for consumption, including pork, chicken, beef and rabbit, as well as fish and seafood. “Banning the consumption of wild animals is a common practice in developed countries and is a universal requirement of modern civilization,” the notice said. Apart from dogs, the new Shenzhen act bars snake, frog and turtle meat from the dinner table.","Shoot Stray Dogs, Win Cash Prizes: How Chinese Officials Slaughtered Canines",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/16/shoot-stray-dogs-win-cash-prizes-how-chinese-officials-slaughtered-canines/,Breitbart

"The economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic was on clear display in the New York Fed’s Empire State Manufacturing Survey released Monday. This is the first piece of economic data to reflect the pandemic and it indicates a very heavy drag. General business conditions in the state have fallen to the lowest level since 2009. From the New York Fed: Business activity declined in New York State, according to firms responding to the March 2020 Empire State Manufacturing Survey. The headline general business conditions index fell thirty-four points to -21.5, its lowest level since 2009. The new orders index dropped to -9.3, pointing to a decline in orders, and the shipments index fell to -1.7. Delivery times lengthened slightly, and inventories increased. Employment levelled off, and the average workweek declined. Input price increases were little changed, while selling prices increased at a slower pace than last month. Optimism about the six-month outlook fell sharply, with firms less optimistic than they have been since 2009. The grey area on the chart indicates a recession.

"During a Monday interview on “Fox & Friends,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams discussed the approach to combating the coronavirus as it spreads across the country. Adams emphasized the importance of social distancing and properly washing hands, but said testing for the disease has now “reached a turning point,” which means more people are being tested at a local level. “[W]e’ve reached a turning point,” Adams said of coronavirus testing. “Important for people to know that the CDC stood up a test in less than one week for a new virus, so that was a record, but the CDC was never designed to provide hundreds of millions of tests. It was designed to respond to outbreaks. So, we went from CDC testing, which was slow by almost design, and then we actually stood up 83 different state labs, and you saw testing increase there. But the turning point was last Thursday when the FDA approved a new rapid throughput test, which will exponentially increase the amount of new tests that can be run. … You’re starting to see more testing at the local level.” He added, “Again, we’ve reached a turning point, and it’s because of the private industry.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Surgeon General on Coronavirus Testing: ‘We’ve Reached a Turning Point’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/surgeon-general-on-coronavirus-testing-weve-reached-a-turning-point/,Breitbart

Cotton told Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade the aim was to get government aid to people directly impacted by the virus. “I don’t think the House bill is going to pass the Senate as it’s written for one basic problem,” he said. “It doesn’t go far enough, and it doesn’t go fast enough. There are too many gaps in coverage for the smallest businesses and for medium-sized businesses. And I and a lot of other senators who I’ve spoken to over the weekend are worried that we’re not doing enough to get cash into the hands of affected workers and families quickly. So we’re going to be focused this week on how to do just that.” “If you’ve got the virus, if you’ve been quarantined because you’ve been exposed to the virus, if your business is shut down, or even if you have to stay home to care for a child whose school is closed, you should not worry about buying the groceries, making the car payments, paying your rent,” Cotton continued. “We’re going to do everything we can to get cash into the hands of affected workers and families as quickly as possible so we can all get through this epidemic — this pandemic together.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",Cotton: ‘We’re Going to Do Everything We Can to Get Cash into the Hands of Affected Workers’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/cotton-were-going-to-do-everything-we-can-to-get-cash-into-the-hands-of-affected-workers/,Breitbart
"On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) called for the nationalization of certain parts of the supply chain, and stated that “we’re getting close to a reality where the government has to ensure that the food supply, that it is not only available, but that it’s equitably distributed.” De Blasio said, “We’re going to need the supply chain nationalized in some form. Right now, there’s no effort to make sure that ventilators, surgical masks, even down to hand sanitizer, all these products should be put on a 24/7 production cycle. Whatever factories anywhere can make them should be cranking them out. They should be distributed according to federal priority, as you would in a war.” He later stated, “We’re providing meals all week at the schools, pick-up meals, breakfast and lunch. We’re going to have to create feeding stations of some kind going forward, of different types. We’re doing home deliveries for seniors. We’re closing down senior center programming, but we’re doing — using senior centers as kitchens in effect, dispensaries to get meals out to seniors at their home.

"The European Union refused to fund border fencing between Greece and Turkey prior to both the current border crisis and the 2015-16 border crisis, denouncing it as “pointless”. “We are against building walls,” declared the then-European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs, and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, in 2018 — a time when many European Union figures and EU member-state politicians, outside of pro-borders Central European countries such as Poland and Hungary, were at pains to signal their opposition to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. “The EU will never be a fortress. Migration will stay not only in Europe and the world for the decades to come,” insisted Avramopoulos — who, perhaps surprisingly, is himself a Greek politician from the right-leaning New Democracy party, then in opposition but now in office and attempting to hold the line against illegal immigration fairly vigorously. The eurocrat — as the EU’s unelected officials are colloquially known — was also a strong backer of the UN Global Compact for Migration, an EU resettlement programme importing tens of thousands of migrants direct from Africa, and the EU-Turkey deal which saw the bloc transfer billions of euros to Ankara in order to persuade it to stem the flow of illegal migrants across the Graeco-Turkish frontier. His assurances that the deal “delivers” and “is beneficial for the European Union and Turkey as well” have unravelled now that the Islamist president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has cancelled it unilaterally, announcing that the gates to Europe through his country are now open and actively transporting migrants to the border in large numbers.

The EU is not and will not co-finance this fence… It is pointless,” a spokesman for the then-European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, told the press in 2012.

"Sunday’s Democrat debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was only the second to mention coronavirus directly, though the issue had emerged weeks before it was first discussed by the candidates. President Donald Trump first mentioned coronavirus on Jan. 22, after it was brought up in a press conference. Vice President Mike Pence discussed it more extensively on Jan. 27. The president imposed a China travel ban Jan. 31. On Feb. 4, President Trump mentioned coronavirus in his State of the Union address, which was torn up by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Congress was still in the midst of the impeachment trial until Feb. 5. Democrats did not mention the coronavirus much at all, and it did not come up in the presidential primary debate in Iowa (Jan. 14). Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg referred to it indirectly in the New Hampshire debate (Feb. 7): “The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we’re seeing coming out of China.” It did not come up in Nevada (Feb. 19). It was first discussed somewhat extensively by the candidates in the South Carolina debate (Feb. 25), which is also when a moderator finally asked candidates about it. While watching tonight's Democratic debate, consider the number of times moderators asked any questions involving coronavirus at the past four Democratic debates: CBS News – February 26: 1 (83rd minute) NBC News – February 19: 0 ABC News – February 7: 0 CNN – January 14: 0 — Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) March 15, 2020  Coronavirus was first brought up by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who accused the president (inaccurately) of firing the pandemic specialists and cutting funding to the Centers for Disease Control. It was mentioned next by Buttigieg, in the context of national security. The moderator then asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) whether she would close the borders to “prevent an outbreak” in the United States. She did not answer the question directly, but said she would have coordinated her response better through the presidency than Trump had. Biden was asked about it and mentioned his experience during the fight against Ebola in 2014. Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer said the president’s “America First” foreign policy was inadequate for coronavirus. He reiterated his criticism of the president’s response to coronavirus in the spin room after the debate, saying that Trump was incompetent. If it could be said that the U.S. government could have done more, and earlier, to fight the coronavirus outbreak, it could also be said that the opposition and the media largely ignored the issue until more than a month after the Trump administration had begun to talk about it. Few anticipated how great a challenge coronavirus would be. Joel B.

"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon went into lockdown and Iraqis prepared for a curfew Monday as part of regional efforts to contain the new coronavirus even as businesses remained open in Iran, which is battling the worst outbreak in the Middle East and where another senior official has died from the virus. The divergent approaches adopted by local authorities reflect continued uncertainty over how to slow the spread of a virus that has infected around 170,000 people worldwide and caused more than 6,500 deaths. Most people experience only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and recover within weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by people with no visible symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Panic broke out in Iraq after authorities announced a weeklong curfew late on Sunday. People raced to supermarkets and swiftly emptied shelves, while others stocked up on kerosene and cooking gas. The curfew, which is set to begin late Tuesday, includes the suspension of all flights from Baghdad’s international airport. Iraq’s Health Ministry has reported 124 cases of coronavirus and nine deaths. In Lebanon, where the government ordered a lockdown starting Sunday night, traffic was thin and in some cases streets were completely empty on Monday, the start of the working week. Restaurants, cafes and bars have been closed since last week and most private businesses were also shuttered Monday. In some areas, police were going around and asking shop owners to close in line with the government orders. Few people could be seen at Lebanon’s seaside corniche, and police were asking them to leave. Pharmacies, bakeries and other businesses related to making or selling food were allowed to stay open. The small country has reported 99 cases and three deaths from the new coronavirus. Hamra Street, the Lebanese capital’s most famous shopping street and a residential district, was eerily quiet as shops, restaurants and cafes along the usually bustling thoroughfare were closed. Both Iraq and Lebanon have been largely in disarray since anti-government protests broke out last year, and Lebanon was mired in its worst financial crisis in years even before the pandemic began. One of the worst outbreaks in the world has unfolded in Iran, which has close ties to both Iraq and Lebanon. Authorities there have reported 14,000 confirmed cases and more than 700 deaths, with the toll rising by more than 100 in the last 24 hours. The real numbers may be even higher, as some have questioned the government’s reporting. Authorities have not ordered businesses to close, however, and many Iranians have dismissed fears about the virus and advice from public health officials to avoid social contact. Restaurants and cafes have remained open, though business has diminished. A member of the Assembly of Experts, which has the power to appoint or dismiss the country’s supreme leader, died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus, the semi-official Fars and Tasnim news agencies reported Monday. Ayatollah Hashem Bathaei, 78, is the latest of several senior Iranian officials to have died from the virus. Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials have caught the virus, compounding fears about Iran’s response to the global pandemic. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is 80 years old and has been in power since 1989, wore disposable gloves at a recent public event, apparently as a precaution. The official leading Iran’s response to the virus on Sunday expressed concerns that health facilities could be overwhelmed if the rate of new cases continues to climb. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency. Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed. Elsewhere in the region, the number of infections has continued to climb even as authorities have imposed strict travel and quarantine measures. Mideast stock markets also tumbled Monday, with the Dubai Financial Market closing down 6.14% and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange down 7.83%. Both have closed their trading floors over fears about the virus. Israel on Monday said its total number of infections had climbed to 250, more than double what it was just a few days ago. Authorities have closed all malls, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and day care centers, and have urged anyone who can work from home to do so. Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial announced Monday that its annual Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony would be held this year without an audience. The ceremony typically draws the country’s top leadership, foreign dignitaries and elderly Holocaust survivors. This year’s ceremony was scheduled to take place on April 20. Later on Monday, Israel will swear in its new Knesset, or parliament, after elections earlier this month. The 120 members will take the oath of office in groups of three, in keeping with bans on large gatherings. Pakistan reported a surge of 41 new cases in its Sindh province, which borders Iran. That brought its total number of infections to 94. Authorities there have closed schools and universities, and postponed an annual military parade planned for March 23. In Dubai, a major global business and travel hub, authorities announced all bars and pubs would be closed through the end of the month. Community pools across Dubai were locked on Monday, closed by developers for the same period. The Persian Gulf island nation of Bahrain, meanwhile, reported its first death from the virus. It has reported 221 confirmed cases.",Lebanon on Coronavirus Lockdown as Iraqis Prepare for Curfew,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/16/lebanon-on-coronavirus-lockdown-as-iraqis-prepare-for-curfew/,Breitbart
"Iran warned Monday the coronavirus pandemic could overwhelm local health facilities as the death toll topped 700 and another senior lawmaker died from the disease. Ayatollah Bathaee, representative of Tehran in the Assembly of Experts, died age 78 on Monday morning, according to the semi-official Tasnim newsagency. The cleric, who had been infected with coronavirus died at a hospital in Qom, the city where the first cases of coronavirus in Iran were detected.

Iran has closed schools and universities, suspended major cultural and sporting events and reduced working hours across the country to slow the contagion, which has spread to all of its 31 provinces. Such has been the devastation caused in Iran, local authorities are digging burial trenches so large they can be seen from space, as Breitbart News reported. The massive pits are being dug at the Behesht-e Masoumeh complex in Qom, about 80 miles south of Tehran. Within a month of its beginning, the two 100-yard trenches were visible by satellite. These trenches will supplement existing efforts to inter the rising death toll in Qom. According to official reports, more than 10,000 Iranians suffer from the coronavirus, although devout Iranian Muslims are releasing online videos showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they have no fear of infection and are willing to die for their faith.

That brings the country’s total death toll to 724, with nearly 14,000 confirmed cases, one of the worst outbreaks outside China. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency.",Another Iran Lawmaker Dies from Coronavirus as Death Toll Soars,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/16/another-iran-lawmaker-dies-from-coronavirus-as-death-toll-soars/,Breitbart
"The first sailor assigned to a U.S. warship has tested “presumptive positive” for the coronavirus, but authorities said Sunday the result needed to be confirmed by military health specialists. The diagnosis came a week after another U.S. Navy sailor stationed in southern Italy contracted the virus, which has killed more than 3,700 people worldwide including nearly 70 in the United States. “A Sailor assigned to the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer (LHD 4) tested ‘presumptive positive’ for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), marking the first case for a sailor aboard a Navy ship,” the Navy said in a statement. The sailor was in quarantine at home, it said, adding that “personnel that the individual immediately identified having close contact with have been notified and are in self-isolation at their residences.” USS Boxer (LHD-4) is alongside at Naval Station San Diego, Calif. and the sailor was first tested on Friday. Results came back on Saturday that indicated the sailor likely had the virus. The Navy said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would need to confirm the positive result as preparations continue to ensure the ongoing health of the fleet. <span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> Other Boxer crew that have come in contact with the presumed-to-be infected sailor have been notified are now in a 14-day quarantine in their quarters and in contact with Navy medical professionals, USNI News reports.

"Claim: Joe Biden claimed Sunday night the United States is a “nation of immigrants.” “Look, we are a nation of immigrants,” Biden said during his CNN debate against Bernie Sanders. He continued: Our future rests upon the Latino community being fully integrated. Twenty-four out of every 100 children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a Latino … We should be embracing, bringing them in, just like what happened with the Irish immigrants after the famine, just what happened with the Italians, et cetera. We have been through this before. Xenophobia is a disease. Verdict: False. Roughly 86 percent of people in the United States are native-born citizens and their native-born children. That 86 percent share means that six out of seven residents in the United States are native-born Americans. Only one in seven people in the United States are either legal immigrants or illegal migrants. The United States’ population is roughly 329.4 million. “Drawing on the most authoritative, current data available about the 44.7 million immigrants residing in the United States as of 2018,” said a February 2020 report by the pro-migration Migration Policy Institute. “Today, more than 40 million people living in the U.S. were born in another country,” said a June 2019 report by the Pew Research Center. In 2017, the U.S. population included 278.8 million native-born citizens, 20.7 million “naturalized citizens,” 13.1 million resident aliens or “legal noncitizens,” and 11.3 million “unauthorized immigrants,” according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The United States is a “Nation of Immigrants” claim was promoted in the late 1950s by then-Sen. John Kennedy. In October 2018, Breitbart reported Rep. Joe Kenndy’s description of the claim: Few felt it as deeply as President John F. Kennedy. In his 1964 book A Nation of Immigrants, recently re-released, my great-uncle outlines the compelling case for immigration, in economic, moral, and global terms. “The abundant resources of this land provided the foundation for a great nation,” he writes. “But only people could make the opportunity a reality. Immigration provided the human resources.” A February 2018 report in the New York Times said that claim is only a “phrase”: “Immigrant advocates today invoke the phrase to remind the country that most Americans have an ancestor who was once a newcomer to the United States.” The article said: Published posthumously, Kennedy’s “A Nation of Immigrants” highlighted the contribution of immigrants when the country was engulfed in a debate over the direction of its immigration policy. The phrase appears at least as far back as 1874, in an editorial published in The Daily State Journal of Alexandria, which praised a bill passed by the Virginia Senate appropriating $15,000 to encourage European immigration. “We are a nation of immigrants and immigrants’ children,” it said. But the “Nation of Immigrants” claim is commonplace, even though it implies that immigrants’ are more American than their native-born descendants. “I’m proud to be among the first to greet you as ‘My fellow Americans’… We can never say it often or loudly enough: Immigrants and refugees revitalize and renew America,” former President Barack Obama claimed at December 2015 naturalization ceremony, while standing under a giant mural of the nation’s Founding Fathers. “We will make America more American by passing – protecting our patriotic, courageous Dreamers!” said Rep. Nancy Pelosi said as she regained the speakership of the House in January 2019. A progressive columnist at the New York Times declared in June 2017: So-called real Americans are screwing up America. Maybe they should leave, so that we can replace them with new and better ones: newcomers who are more appreciative of what the United States has to offer, more ambitious for themselves and their children, and more willing to sacrifice for the future. In other words, just the kind of people we used to be — when “we” had just come off the boat… I’m the child of immigrants and grew up abroad, I have always thought of the United States as a country that belongs first to its newcomers — the people who strain hardest to become a part of it because they realize that it’s precious; and who do the most to remake it so that our ideas, and our appeal, may stay fresh. “The U.S. is back to being a nation of immigrants,” said an August 2018 report at Axios.com: The share of the U.S. population made up by immigrants has returned to the levels at the turn of the 20th century — although the makeup of today’s immigrant population looks very different. Why it matters: As we saw a century ago, and are witnessing again now, immigration brings needed labor and economic benefits, but is often met with backlash from those who fear the America they know is slipping away.    ",Fact Check: Joe Biden Claimed the U.S. Is a ‘Nation of Immigrants’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/fact-check-joe-biden-says-the-u-s-is-a-nation-of-immigrants/,Breitbart
"The European Union has said that the Greek government must allow migrants to apply for asylum, despite its rhetorical support for their efforts to prevent the Turkish government from facilitating a wave of illegal migration into Greece. Ylva Johansson, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, insisted: “Individuals in the European Union have the right to apply for asylum. This is in the treaty, this is in international law. This we can’t suspend.” After Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s Islamist president, announced the migrants would be free to pass through his country into Europe, Greece suspended migrants’ automatic right to claim and asylum, to allow border forces to turn illegal migrants back and prevent a 2015-style deluge. The EU does not typically allow its member-states to take such decisions on their own, but Greek prime minister Kyriákos Mitsotákis claimed he had invoked a little-known emergency clause in the EU treaties to permit the move — a claim which has been disputed by anti-borders actors and now the EU itself. “We are going to discuss actually what they are doing, but they have to let people apply for asylum,” said Commissioner Johansson — a Swede from the Scandinavian country’s Social Democrat party — in comments reported by the Guardian. WATCH: EU-funded Turkish Armoured Vehicle Rips Down Greek Border Fence https://t.co/4sL0uEHlsY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 10, 2020  The left-wing newspaper suggested that the emergency clause Prime Minister Mitsotákis invoked cannot be used unless the European Union proposes it and all member-states agree — and Commissioner Johansson was clear that the bloc had no plans to suspend the right to claim asylum. Indeed, the Swede favours “a mandatory solidarity mechanism” to tackle the Greek border crisis — i.e. a revival of the compulsory migrant redistribution quotas the EU tried to impose on its member-states following the 2015-16 influx. These quotas, while partially implemented, foundered in the face of pro-borders, right-leaning governments in Poland, Hungary, and the rest of Central Europe. These countries resented efforts to force them to absorb a share of the migration influx which, unlike the German and other Western European governments which voted for the quotas in the European Council, they had always opposed. “We believe that a high number of Muslims necessarily leads to parallel societies,” said Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán in 2018. “Multiculturalism is just an illusion. We do not want that. And we will not have anything forced on us.” While the Hungarian leader’s stance is now depicted as extreme by large sections of the media, it in fact closely resembles the position of Germany’s Angela Merkel in 2010, when she said that multiculturalism had “failed, utterly failed”.

Approximately 10,000 pilgrims returned from Saudi Arabia on Saturday night, youth and sports minister Mehmet Kasapoglu was quoted as saying by the official Anadolu news agency. Koca said the number of confirmed cases in Turkey reached six after one of the pilgrims who returned from visiting the holy sites in Saudi Arabia over the last one week tested positive. “Those found suspicious are hospitalised as soon as they return and tested,” he said. Turkey’s religious affairs authority, Diyanet, said the travels for pilgrimage have been halted from February 27. As part of its bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, Turkey has applied travel restrictions on a total of 15 countries including France, Italy and Germany.

"Sunday on MSNBC’s “Kasie DC,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) slammed President Donald Trump and his administration for putting the United States “weeks and weeks behind” on combating the coronavirus threat. According to Ryan, the United States was so far behind in testing because Trump thought the coronavirus was a “hoax” and was in “denial” about the legitimacy of the uproar. “I think the University of Cincinnati is starting to produce their own tests because the federal government — it was a [woeful] attempt to try to get where we want to be as far as testing,” the Ohio Democrat outlined. “We are, you know, weeks and weeks behind because the president said it was a hoax and we were in denial, so, of course, we’re going to be behind on these things. So, we are lucky to have them. They’re not at a level we want, and we don’t have enough tests that we need here in Ohio. … We think there may be over 100,000 people who would test positive, but we don’t have the tests.” Ryan stressed, “[H]aving the tests available at the level we need to be able to stop this is really, really important.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Ryan: U.S. ‘Weeks Behind’ on Coronavirus Because Trump Thought It Was a Hoax,2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/15/ryan-u-s-weeks-behind-on-coronavirus-because-trump-thought-it-was-a-hoax/,Breitbart
"Democrat frontrunner Joe Biden said Sunday he will restart the catch and release of southern migrants into Americans’ workplaces, neighborhoods, and K-12 schools. “No one, no one would be put in jail while waiting for their [asylum] hearing,” Biden told the audience during CNN’s Democrat debate. President Donald Trump has largely blocked the huge 2019 inflow of Latin American migrants into blue-collar jobs by ending catch and release policies, which allow migrants to get the U.S jobs they need to pay off their smuggling debts to the cartel-affiliates coyotes. By ending catch and release, Trump created an economic deterrent to further migration, causing an immediate crash in migrant numbers. In May 2019, for example, 140,000 migrants paid thousands of dollars to be smuggled across the U.S. border. In January, only 30,000 people migrated to the border because many would-be migrants understood they would not be released to get a U.S. job. The shutdown of catch and release also pressured U.S. employers to raise Americans’ wages — and to keep jobs open for sidelined Americans. In 2019, wages for blue-collar Americans rose roughly five percent, while wages for white-collar Americans rose by less than four percent. Released migrants can also hide from enforcement authorities and use their U.S. paychecks to hire coyotes for their spouses. The jobs can also fund the coyotes who bring their children up to the border’s “Unaccompanied Alien Children” loophole and then into the K-12 schools needed by Americans’. In May 2019, roughly 80,000 migrants were allowed into the United States because the rush of 140,000 migrants overwhelmed the border defenses. In February 2002, 95 percent of migrants were denied release and were instead redirected home or to wait in Mexico until an asylum court can hear their plea, border officials told Breitbart News. However, the officials also said they released 2,000 people into the United States. They were released for reasons of health and to serve as witnesses in court cases, officials said.",Joe Biden Promises to Restart ‘Catch and Release’ of Migrants,2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/15/joe-biden-promises-to-restart-catch-and-release-of-migrants/,Breitbart
"Governors and mayors across the nation are issuing orders limiting the size of public gatherings and closing non-essential entertainment venues to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. California, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington state, and New York City are among the places that ordered bars to close and restaurants to stop dine-in service. Takeout and delivery will still be allowed. In New Orleans and Chicago, people clad in green for St. Patrick’s Day packed bars and spilled onto crowded sidewalks Saturday, even after the cities canceled their parades. “I’m not about to put my life on hold because this is going around,” Kyle Thomas told the Chicago Sun-Times. Thomas, a nurse from Colorado, said he had flown to Chicago to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with friends and thought people might be ”overreacting.” In New Orleans, Syd Knight, 86, celebrated despite the public health warnings and the higher risk she faced because of her age. “The Lord will take care of us all,” Knight told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate. Oklahoma’s governor tweeted a picture of himself and his children at a crowded metro restaurant Saturday night. In the since-deleted tweet, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt wrote: “Eating with my kids and all my fellow Oklahomans at the @CollectiveOKC. It’s packed tonight!” “The governor will continue to take his family out to dinner and to the grocery store without living in fear, and encourages Oklahomans to do the same,” Charlie Hannema, a spokesman for the governor, said in an email. Health officials have advised people to distance themselves from each other socially. Some states have banned gatherings with more than a certain number of people. Those warnings have become more urgent as the disease spread in the U.S., where about 3,500 people have become infected and more than 60 have died. The vast majority of people who contract the new virus recover within weeks. It causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but can lead to more severe illness, including pneumonia for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems. “The time for persuasion and public appeals is over,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. “This is not a joke. No one is immune to this.” The Democratic governor ordered all bars and restaurants in his state to close from Monday night until March 30. He said he had tried earlier last week to appeal to everyone’s good judgment to stay home, to avoid bars, and not congregate in crowds. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a statement saying he will limit the city’s 27,000 restaurants, bars and cafes to food takeout and delivery beginning Tuesday. Nightclubs, movie theaters, small theater houses, and concert venues will have to close. Washington, the state hardest hit by the virus with more than 40 dead, will see its bars, restaurants, entertainment and recreation facilities all temporarily closed except for food takeout and delivery. “These are very difficult decisions, but hours count here and very strong measures are necessary to slow the spread of the disease,” Inslee said. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker also ordered all bars and dine-in restaurants to close for three weeks. The Republican asked residents “to take a deep breath and understand the rationale behind this guidance.” All bars and restaurants in Ohio are closed until further notice. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said the “very drastic action” was prompted by concerns from around the state about crowded bars. “If we don’t take these actions now, it’ll be too late,” he said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs to close in the nation’s most populous state. The Democrat said the new orders are guidelines that “we have the capacity to enforce if necessary.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive order Sunday evening closing all “bars, nightclubs, restaurants (except takeout/delivery), entertainment venues, and other establishments in the city of Los Angeles” until March 31. Officials in New Jersey are considering a statewide curfew to help prevent the spread of the virus, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday. “A friend of mine walked into a bar/restaurant last night in Asbury Park and they were packed,” Murphy, a Democrat, said on WBLS-FM 107.5. “And people are on top of each other. And that’s probably, sadly, at least for the near term, scenarios that we’re not going to be able to abide by much longer because, inevitably, somebody is going to infect somebody else in a situation like that.” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said it was “unacceptable” that people were ignoring a ban issued by Gov. John Bel Edwards on gatherings of more than 250 people. The violators were “actively increasing the danger to their neighbors and their loved ones,” Cantrell said. The hashtag “StayTheFHome” was trending on Twitter on Sunday. Several countries in Europe have closed bars. Advising people to completely avoid restaurants “might be overkill right now,” the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” but he added that he wouldn’t go to one himself because he didn’t want to be in a “crowded place” and risk having to self-quarantine. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a recommendation Sunday night that all in-person events involving 50 people or more be called off for the next eight weeks. “CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next 8 weeks, organizers … cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States,” the recommendation stated. “Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing.” The Associated Press contributed to this article.","California, Washington, Ohio, Massachusetts, Illinois Close Bars and Restaurants over Coronavirus",2020-03-15,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/15/california-washington-ohio-massachusetts-illinois-close-bars-and-restaurants-over-coronavirus/,Breitbart
"Sunday on his Fox News Channel show “The Revolution,” Steve Hilton addressed the coronavirus pandemic and what Americans are being told by public health officials on television. Hilton said people have heard from public health officials and question why they have heard there was little risk for young and healthy people dying from the coronavirus but yet schools and other large gatherings are being shut down. “There’s a curious divergence between the real world and the people on TV and Twitter,” Hilton began. “On TV, you see facts and responsible reporting and important helpful advice, to be sure, but also, too often unhelpful overdramatizing.” Hilton went on to point out there is a big question still not answered by the health officials — why are the people who are most likely to die from contracting the coronavirus not the ones being isolated from the public? “I have a plea to Dr. Fauci and the others. You want all Americans to cooperate with your public health strategy. At the organizational level with the NBA and so on, that is happening,” Hilton stated. “But there are still millions of Americans who quite frankly don’t buy into what you’re saying, and simply repeating it won’t work.” He continued, “You need to answer the big question many Americans are asking, and it is this: Instead of closing schools, colleges, sports and other large gatherings for the general population, why don’t we isolate the vulnerable population like California just announced? instead of draconian steps that will tank the economy for everyone, why don’t we focus our draconian action on those most at risk? Now, I’m sure there’s a good answer to that question, but we haven’t heard it yet from Dr. Fauci or any of them.

"LOS ANGELES, California — Local grocery store shelves sat bare at the end of a weekend of aggressive buying by consumers stocking up for long stays at home during the coronavirus outbreak. Sources in the food industry told Breitbart News that the supply chain should respond well, though there may be a few bottlenecks, and delays in individual products. One California produce farmer told Breitbart News that customers have been “buying like crazy,” and that he had sold “two months’ supply in one week.” He said he expected farms to keep producing. Local reservoirs are well-supplied, especially after several days of rain — a good sign in a state where dry years mean entire farms can go offline. It is also possible that grocery shelves will stay full once the initial wave of buying has passed. One industry executive was also optimistic, but did not want to be quoted: he was in self-imposed quarantine. That illustrates a potential problem in the food industry, as in others: how to keep the workforce on the job — when local authorities are banning gatherings, school closings are forcing parents to stay home, and incidental contact with possible coronavirus victims could take employees out of commission. Restaurants still have enough food; their problem is a lack of customers after a sudden, sharp drop in demand. “A lot of us are sitting on [food] inventory right now,” one restaurant owner told Breitbart News. However, he said, there was speculation that distributors might not purchase new food stocks, given the downturn in the industry, and a possible credit crunch. Amidst the crisis, there may be new opportunities — for delivery services. On Sunday night, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that restaurants would only be allowed to supply food through takeout and delivery, starting Tuesday. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti took similar action. That new circumstance is expanding market for companies like Postmates and DoorDash. Once seen as a convenience, or a nuisance, now delivery companies may become a necessity. As long as there are enough drivers, and they remain healthy, and food preparation facilities can steer clear of coronavirus, the answer to any lingering grocery store woes may be outsourcing family meals.

"During Sunday night’s eleventh debate between Democrat primary candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders repeatedly defended China’s “progress on poverty.” He did not note the astronomical death toll that preceded its alleged success. Sanders cornered himself into defending the Chinese Communist Party in a series of answers to questions about his repeated support for communist Cuba, which he claimed in the past deserved praise for increasing literacy rates in the region’s formerly wealthiest country at gunpoint. Univisión’s Ilia Calderón, one of the moderators for the debate also hosted by CNN, asked Sanders to answer how he could expect Cuban-Americans in Florida to vote for him after he repeatedly approved of the murderous Castro regime. “I have opposed authoritarianism, whether it’s in Cuba, whether it’s in Saudi Arabia, whether it’s in China, or whether it is in Russia. That is my life record,” Sanders replied, a false claim he has made repeatedly when confronted with his near-routine support of violent communist tyrannies. As Sanders did not address Calderón’s question regarding Florida voters in any way, she repeated it, more broadly asking if it would be wiser not to compliment dictatorships like Cuba’s. Sanders responded by turning the question into one about China. “I think you could make the same point about China. China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society, ok? But would anybody deny — would any economist deny — that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago?” Sanders asked. “That’s a fact. So I think we condemn authoritarianism whether it’s in China, Russia, Cuba, anyplace else. But to simply say nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would, I think, be incorrect.” Biden then stepped into the discussion, offering helplessly: “China is an authoritarian dictatorship; that’s what it is. We have to deal with them because they’re there.” To his credit, Biden noted that China is currently imprisoning, torturing, and enslaving at least one million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in concentration camps. Sanders disputes that the brutal human rights situation in China negates its alleged “progress on poverty” and that it is “absurd” to deny the “positive” the Chinese Communist Party has contributed to its people. Much of Sunday’s debate focused on America’s response to the global pandemic caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, an outbreak the Chinese Communist Party hid from the world for months, making it nearly impossible to stop on multiple continents. The Chinese Communist Party, since founding the People’s Republic of China in the mid-20th century, has claimed to spearhead prodigious poverty alleviation programs. The original such program under dictator Mao Zedong was known as the Great Leap Forward, a plan to turn all of China from an agrarian society to an industrial one. While Mao is personally believed responsible for the deaths of 70 million people, the Great Leap Forward itself is only believed to be responsible for 45 million deaths. To turn China into an “industrial,” prosperous nation, Mao banned private farming and forced communities to all participate in farming, demanding impossibly agricultural yields that never occurred. Mao also forced communities to sacrifice any metal belongings, melting them to use in attempts at manufacturing. While Mao murdered many for opposing his authoritarianism or simply for suspecting their disagreement, the vast majority of the deaths under his poverty alleviation program were the result of famine. Citing author Yang Jisheng, The Guardian‘s Tania Branigan described life during the Great Leap Forward: A decade after the Communist party took power in 1949, promising to serve the people, the greatest manmade disaster in history stalks an already impoverished land. In an unremarkable city in central Henan province, more than a million people – one in eight – are wiped out by starvation and brutality over three short years. In one area, officials commandeer more grain than the farmers have actually grown. In barely nine months, more than 12,000 people – a third of the inhabitants – die in a single commune; a tenth of its households are wiped out. Thirteen children beg officials for food and are dragged deep into the mountains, where they die from exposure and starvation. A teenage orphan kills and eats her four-year-old brother. Forty-four of a village’s 45 inhabitants die; the last remaining resident, a woman in her 60s, goes insane. Others are tortured, beaten or buried alive for declaring realistic harvests, refusing to hand over what little food they have, stealing scraps or simply angering officials. Sanders did not specify which of China’s many poverty alleviation programs he was praising, though he said he was comparing current poverty levels with those of 40 or 50 years ago, placing his point of comparison about a decade after the Great Leap Forward and in the Cultural Revolution, which historians estimate killed up to eight million people.

Suddenly, today, Joe Biden is a free-spending socialist.” He added that while Biden is “basically, after all is said and done, maintaining the status quo in health care. … I think we are winning the ideological struggle, and we won it tonight.” Sanders further stated, “I think you have heard media and others talking about, isn’t it remarkable, how when we had 18 candidates to begin this process, so many of them have moved so far of where we were four years ago. You just heard this tonight. Yesterday, Biden, basically, is saying, yeah, I voted for that bankruptcy bill, bad idea, I’m going to adopt Elizabeth Warren’s position, that’s a good bill, okay? Today, he says, oh, I think we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, up to a certain level. Yes, we have brought Biden — well, we’ll see how real it is.

"Claim: Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed on Sunday during CNN’s Democrat presidential debate that the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, was due to climate change. Verdict: False. “What’s Darfur all about? Darfur was all about the fact that the sub-Sarahan desert, because of the change in the climate, no longer had enough arable land,” Biden said during a conversation about the alleged effects of climate change. However, despite Biden’s claim, many analysts have blamed racial conflict and land rights, not climate change. The United Nations (U.N.) estimated that 300,000 had died because of the conflict. The International Criminal Court (ICC) had indicted Sudan President Omar al-Bashir for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. James Copnall, a Sudan analyst, wrote in 2013 that the Darfur conflict originated over “hakurat,” or land rights. Copnall also wrote that the conflict arose between Arab militias and African groups such as the Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit. The Atlantic helped popularize the idea that the “real roots” of the Darfur conflict was “global warming” in a 2007 article. The Atlantic noted that much of Darfur’s lands were “failing,” which was explained through “imprudent land use.” Atlantic writer Stephan Faris wrote: Why did Darfur’s lands fail? For much of the 1980s and ’90s, environmental degradation in Darfur and other parts of the Sahel (the semi-arid region just south of the Sahara) was blamed on the inhabitants. Dramatic declines in rainfall were attributed to mistreatment of the region’s vegetation. Imprudent land use, it was argued, exposed more rock and sand, which absorb less sunlight than plants, instead reflecting it back toward space. This cooled the air near the surface, drawing clouds downward and reducing the chance of rain. “Africans were said to be doing it to themselves,” says Isaac Held, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Faris wrote that climate scientists devised an alternative theory: climate change had changed Darfur’s environment. “This was not caused by people cutting trees or overgrazing,” Alessandra Giannini, a Columbia University climate professor, said. However, even as the Faris noted, it remains an “open question” on the extent to which human activity can be blamed for a country’s changing environment.

The president’s exit from Sunday’s press conference prompted Chris Evans to lash out on social media. “The president just ran off stage after his rambling press conference without answering a single question,” the Knives Out tweeted. “America wants answers.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden cost taxpayers nearly $200,000 as he toured the globe during his father’s time in office. According to USASpending.gov, a database that collects and reports unclassified government expenditures, Biden’s trips cost taxpayers $193,696 for Secret Service protection. The Washington Free Beacon, which was first to report on the matter, noted; That amount is nearly four times the recorded security bill of the four adult Trump children—combined. Biden visited more than 10 countries during his father’s term, including China, Qatar, and South Africa, according to the database. Throughout his travels, Biden received multiple bills, which involved taxpayer payments to a “miscellaneous foreign contractor” or a “miscellaneous foreign awardee.” Most obvious throughout the records in the database was Biden’s cost of Secret Service protection. The totals for Biden, who has never held a government position, far surpassed that of the Trump family, which are recorded by the database to have spent about $40,000. Biden has faced scrutiny from several within Congress for his excessive travel. Earlier this year, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) requested Hunter Biden’s travel records from the Secret Service in an effort to identify “potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates.” While the database did not contain records on his time in Ukraine, it did contain information on his trips to China in 2013 and 2014, as noted by the Washington Free Beacon: The database has not disclosed details about the Secret Service protection for Hunter Biden’s time in Ukraine. It does, however, show that Hunter visited China on at least two other occasions, once each before and after the December 2013 meeting. The records show that Hunter Biden stayed in China for one to two weeks in June 2013 and March 2014, costing taxpayers nearly $13,000. Last week, Hunter Biden reached a final settlement in a paternity and child support case in Arkansas after repeatedly delaying the case and flouting court orders to release financial information.

But, I’m going to be announcing more actions today. We closed the schools yesterday, making sure there’s childcare for healthcare workers, because again, this all comes down to hospital capacity. Some of these states have closed schools and made no capacity for childcare and now you see healthcare workers and nurses not showing up. Closing schools, closing bars, closing restaurants, closing mass gatherings, we’ll be doing more of that.

"The Supreme Court announced Monday that it is suspending oral arguments scheduled for March and early April due to health concerns stemming from the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. “In keeping with public health precautions recommended in response to COVID-19, the Supreme Court is postponing the oral arguments currently scheduled for the March session,” the court said in a statement. “The court’s March session includes April 1. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” the statement added. One of the postponed arguments involves a case regarding whether House Democrats can obtain President Donald Trump’s financial records. Six of the nine justices are 65 and older, at higher risk of getting very sick from the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, and Stephen Breyer, 81, are the oldest members of the court. There is no new date set for the postponed arguments. the building has been closed to the public since last week. The only other time the 85-year-old court building was closed for arguments was in October 2001, when anthrax was detected in the court mailroom. That led the justices to hold arguments in the federal courthouse about a half mile from the Supreme Court, Within a week and after a thorough cleaning, the court reopened. In 1918, when the court still met inside the Capitol, arguments were postponed for a month because of the flu pandemic. In the nation’s early years, in August 1793 and August 1798, adjustments were made because of yellow fever outbreaks, the court said.

"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Monday endorsed a policy prescription in which the U.S. government would give $1,000 monthly to every American adult as part of an effort to help ease financial strain during the coronavirus outbreak. “Every American adult should immediately receive $1,000 to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy,” Romney said in a statement. The Utah Republican also called on the Senate to pass a House bipartisan coronavirus relief package that was approved early Saturday morning following negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). “The House coronavirus response package contains critical measures to help families in Utah and across the nation in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, and the Senate should act swiftly on this legislation,” he stated. Romney’s backing of the measure comes after Harvard Professor Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under President Barack Obama, proposed the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Congress should pass a “one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria,” wrote Furman. The law “should also specify that the payments would continue in 2021 and beyond if the unemployment rate rises to 5.5% and remains there or higher. Hopefully this will not happen, but if it does, the money will be needed,” he added. Furman’s proposal echoes that of Breitbart News Economics editor John Carney, who wrote Saturday that the government “need[s] to put cash into the hands of the American people as quickly as possible.” “I propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending,” Carney argued. “It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects.” The idea draws on universal basic income, championed by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which the government would give all citizens a guaranteed annual income from the government. In a Monday tweet, Yang urged Congress to adopt a form of UBI to help combat the pandemic: “What exactly is the political downside of putting money into people’s hands?

Tom Cotton (R-AR), have said that the House’s relief package is doomed to fail in the upper chamber because it doesn’t go far enough. “For one basic problem, it doesn’t go far enough, it doesn’t go fast enough,” Cotton told Fox & Friends, noting that small and medium-sized businesses aren’t sufficiently covered by the bill. “I and a lot of the other senators, who I’ve spoken to over the weekend, are worried that we’re not doing enough to get cash in the hands of affected workers and families quickly so we’re going to be focused this week on how to do just that,” the Arkansas Republican continued. “We worry that the bill setting up a new and complicated system relying on businesses giving paid sick leave and then getting a refundable tax credit won’t move quickly enough and could put pressure on those businesses to lay workers off.” “We don’t want to see layoffs, we want to see people who are at home, if they have any reason to be home, supported immediately. This is an emergency measure that only needs to last a few weeks if we all take the prudent steps necessary,” he added.","Mitt Romney Endorses Giving $1,000 to Every American Adult During Coronavirus Outbreak",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/mitt-romney-endorses-giving-1000-to-every-american-adult-during-coronavirus-outbreak/,Breitbart

Clyburn told Axios that he “seriously” feels the United States under Trump’s leadership could go the same direction as Nazi Germany given how Republicans, much like Nazis knew Adolf Hitler was lying but did not check him on anything, are letting the president get away with lying. “We see an open fight with the media,” he said. “Everything is fake news unless it is favorable towards this president. We have heard open discussions about him, referring to himself as the ‘Law Enforcer in Chief.’ We don’t have that kind of stuff in this country.

Co-hosts Joe Scarborough said, “We can talk about what’s going on inside the White House. You know a lot of the players in there right now. Let’s talk about what’s happening on Wall Street. Obviously, the president got what he finally wanted from the fed which is reducing the interest rates about as low as you can reduce them. And yet we still have a run. Australia last night, lost about 10% of their market value. Asia also routed. Europe routed. And it looks like that’s going to be happening to the United States markets, as well. Wall Street set up for a very grim open. Why do you think the fed cut, the dramatic fed action yesterday, is having no impact on the markets this morning?” Scaramucci said, “I think, Joe, good morning, but I actually think the fed has had a major impact on the markets. This would be way worse if they didn’t make that dramatic Sunday night cut, and why is that? Because you literally have set a pause button on the global economy for three to six months. And as you know, many people in the United States and globally are living paycheck to paycheck, or if you’re in a small business, you’re living revenue day to revenue day, and a result of which, when you step back and analyze the economy. Forget about the market for a second. There are many businesses and many families that won’t be able to sustain that.” He continued, “The next thing that the market knows and people are starting to figure this out now is that Donald Trump is the virus. At the end of the day, what he’s done is affected and replicated through the executive branch, and he’s destroyed the crisis management elements of the executive branch that we need right now. Not only here in the United States, but globally. So the real tragedy of all of this— if the Federal Reserve can only do so much to help the markets. You’re going to need fiscal stimulus here and literally handing out free money to people to help them afford their rent, help them pay their waiters and waitresses in their closed restaurants. And again, it’s a national tragedy born from one person. You have remember to, the president’s staff is afraid of him. And so they don’t like dealing with them and they’re trying to make something that’s very insane, which is President Trump, sound sane. And so this is the danger that we’re dealing with right now. But the market does know, Joe, that Donald Trump is actually the virus and he’s replicated throughout the executive branch and has more or less decapitated their ability to handle this crisis.” He added, “The first thing is to have a group intervention with the president and explain to him what he is doing in terms of telling people we’ve got it under control, and this litany of 18,000 or 20,000 lies at this point. They’ve got to isolate him. He almost needs to go into a verbal communication quarantine to help out the rest of the nation. The second step you have to do is listen to Dr. Fauci. We likely need a 14 to a 21-day quarantine of all nonessential services in the United States. If you listen to any of the people that really understand this problem, directionally, we’ll probably save the excess capacity issues we’re going to have in the hospital. So, to me, step one, quarantine the president. Get him off of Twitter. Get him away from a television camera, and then, step two, bring people in like Dr. Fauci to explain what’s going on and take immediate and aggressive action here. You have to overcompensate for the mistakes that have been made, but we need to do it immediately.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","Scaramucci: ‘Trump Is the Virus’ — He Needs to Be ‘Quarantined’ from Twitter, Television",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/scaramucci-trump-is-the-virus-he-needs-to-be-quarantined-from-twitter-television/,Breitbart
"A Today show staffer has contracted the Chinese coronavirus, leading co-hosts Craig Melvin and Al Roker to temporarily go off-air, co-anchor Savannah Guthrie announced on Monday. “Personal note, for this show: Last night we learned that a colleague of ours on the third hour of ‘Today’ has tested positive for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus,” Guthrie announced: We learned late last night a colleague on the 3rd hour of TODAY tested positive for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution, Craig and Al are taking the morning off while we map that colleague’s close contacts. pic.twitter.com/aVHJpMU1Fj — TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 16, 2020  Because of that and out of an “abundance of caution,” co-hosts Melvin and Roker took the morning off so that the network can “trace their contacts, see what’s going on with them,” Guthrie continued, adding that they both “feel good.” “We promise to keep you posted. Both are fine right now. They feel good. But caution is the order of the day,” she said. NBC News president Noah Oppenheim also released a statement to staffers. We have learned that a TODAY employee based at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and working for the 9am hour has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19). We are fully supporting our colleague, who is experiencing mild symptoms and receiving medical care, and I know you join me in sending our very best for a quick recovery. As you know, we have been preparing for this possibility and are taking all necessary steps to ensure the health and safety of our teams, which includes multiple deep cleanings of our offices, control room and Studio 1A. Additionally, we are identifying employees who had been in close proximity to the affected employee and — while not required to do so by the NY Health Department — are in the process of asking those who had close contact to self-isolate. The news comes as networks make key changes as the concerns over the coronavirus loom large. CBS News shut its doors in New York for a deep clean last week after two staffers contracted the virus: Employees will be asked to work remotely for the next two days and broadcasts moved to accommodate the cleaning, the network said. For instance, “CBS This Morning” will originate out of Washington on Thursday and Friday while the New York offices are cleaned. People who came in contact with the sick employees will be asked to self-quarantine for the next two weeks, CBS News President Susan Zirinsky said in a memo to staff. “At this point, we anticipate the offices will be open Monday,” Zirinsky wrote. … Meanwhile, The Associated Press and NBC News on Wednesday announced work-at-home plans as concerns about the global pandemic grew. CNN, along with the Democratic National Committee (DNC), also made key changes for the Democrat debate on Sunday, holding it in-studio in the nation’s capital rather than in Arizona, as previously planned.

"The ACLU is asking a judge to release migrants from a Seattle detention center because China’s Wuhan epidemic is spreading through the state. “Public health experts say releasing immigrant detainees who are at heightened risk for COVID-19 due to age or medical condition is “a critically important way to meaningfully mitigate that risk,” said a tweet from the ACLU, which opposes most border enforcement. The Wuhan virus spreads rapidly among people who live in close contact with each other. It can impose crippling sickness on some young and healthy people, but it is deadly to many sick or old people. Almost 40,000 people are being held in roughly 20 immigration detention centers — partly because the ACLU has sought to kill the laws and barriers which deter migrants from illegally sneaking into U.S. workplaces and residential areas. The Department of Homeland Security considers Wuhan to be a major risk and has reportedly shut down family visits to minimize the chance of a disease outbreak in a detention center. One fix to the dilemma would be a rapid return of the illegal migrants to their home countries, according to Jessica Vaughan, the policy director at the Center for Immigration studies. “Wouldn’t they be more at risk on the outside?” she responded via Twitter. “Maybe repatriation to [their] home country would be safest.” A Buzzfeed report spotlighted the foreign detainees who are most vulnerable to China’s epidemic:: The filing in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington identified nine immigrants in custody at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, including a 48-year-old Jamaican woman with cholangitis, a progressive liver disease, who has been told she has only 10 to 12 years to live. The advocates said the woman was “critically vulnerable to COVID-19 because of her autoimmune disease and diabetes.” … “ICE has the responsibility to protect the safety of all who are in immigration detention. As a first step, it should immediately release our clients who have already been identified by the federal government as being most at risk because of this epidemic,” said Matt Adams, legal director for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which joined the ACLU in the lawsuit. “If it waits to react to worst-case scenarios once they take hold, it will already be too late.” The virus is already forcing border agencies to screen deportees before they are sent back to cooperating countries, including Guatemala and El Salvador. Deportees with high temperatures are kept off the returns flights out of concern that the deportees might carry the disease from U.S. detention centers into the vulnerable countries and possibly wreck the countries’ cooperation. The Department of Homeland Security responded to Buzzfeed.com: “Detainees who meet CDC criteria for epidemiologic risk of exposure to COVID-19 are housed separately from the general population. ICE places detainees with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a single medical housing room, or in a medical airborne infection isolation room specifically designed to contain biological agents, such as COVID-19,” ICE said in a statement describing its process for isolating detainees who potentially have the disease. “This prevents the spread of the agent to other individuals and the general public. ICE transports individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, or those who require higher levels of care or monitoring, to appropriate hospitals with expertise in high risk care.” Pro-migration Democrats are also urging the release of many migrants into the United States. “We urge you to prioritize the health and safety of those in your custody and employment by reducing detention numbers in a safe and swift manner, including by expeditiously placing children in homes and releasing non-priority detainees,” said the March 13 letter signed by the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Joaquin Castro, (D-Texas). On March 15, Buzzfeed also spotlighted an effort by progressives to shutter the packed immigration courts for several weeks: The union representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement prosecutors joined immigration judges and lawyers in calling for the immediate shutdown of courts across the country to curb the spread of the coronavirus, an unprecedented alliance that signals the deep anxiety that has spread through all facets of the US immigration system. “These are not normal times,” Fanny Behar Ostrow, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 511, which represents ICE prosecutors, told BuzzFeed News. “This is a real crisis. We all have the same interests and the same concerns.” Ostrow is an ICE prosecutor in Miami. … Courtrooms can be cramped as judges, attorneys, family members, experts and others gather for hearings every day. These conditions, said Ostrow, are particularly concerning for ICE prosecutors who in recent days have been panicked, describing people coughing and appearing sick continuing to come to courtrooms. Some state and local governments have begun releasing U.S. criminals amid the virus. WHJL.com reported: Administrative Judge Brendan Sheehan told the I-TEAM earlier this week that inmates are already in poor health, and it wouldn’t take much for the coronavirus to spread wildly behind bars. Sheehan also said almost any kind of inmate could be considered. “You gotta remember, the goal of this is to protect the community and the safety of the inmates. If someone’s a serious violent person, well, we’re using our discretion to make sure the community’s safe also,” he told the I-TEAM on Thursday. 10M+ illegals are mixed in with 315M Americans.

"Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) on Monday called for some very aggressive measures to take on the fallout from the coronavirus threat. Cotton has called for a national “shutdown” and suggested universal basic income as possible measures to be proactive against the virus’ impact on the public. During an appearance on Fox News Channel on Monday afternoon, Cotton acknowledged his proposals were “extraordinary,” but added it was better to overreact than to underreact. “[I]f we take these extraordinary measures, painful though they may be, hardships though they may be, though they may impose, it will arrest the spread of the virus more quickly,” the Arkansas Republican U.S. Senator said. “And that’s ultimately the way we get the economy back on its feet and we get markets back, is to stop the spread of the virus. It’s better to be accused of overreacting in retrospect than underreacting.” “Look at what’s happened in Italy,” Cotton continued. “Two weeks ago, Italians were sitting in cafes, sipping wine and coffee. Today, elderly Italians are being denied care and administered last rites because their health care system is completely overtaxed.

"Ret. Gen. Jack Keane told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump “is on the mark” in addressing the coronavirus outbreak, contrasting the severity of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 and 2010 with the current viral spread. “I think the president is on the mark in dealing with this crisis,” estimated Keane. “I  do think it’s unfortunate that people poke at him a politically, and the fact he’s a Republican shouldn’t be relevant at this point. The nation is facing a crisis. We’ve got a leader in charge of it. Let’s get there and support him whether he’s a Republican or Democrat. That’s the way I think we should be approaching the problem.” LISTEN:
 Keane contrasted the 2009-2010 response to H1N1 swine flu with that of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. “We’ve kind of been here before,” stated Keane. “When we had the H1N1 swine flu in 2009 and ’10, that was a pandemic. Sixty-one million people were infected in the United States — we have thousands infected now [with coronavirus] — and 12,000-plus died of it in that two-year time frame. We didn’t go to battle stations as we seem to be going now and stopping everything from taking place.” Keane continued, “I do think there is something of an overreaction, myself, when I look at it. I don’t think there’s enough emphasis on how many people are actually recovering from this. Some people are talking about the fact that they weren’t even seriously sick, but they had the COVID-19 virus, and they wouldn’t have known that they had it if they had not been tested. They were surprised by it. Now, that’s not all the cases, but it is some of the cases. In fact, in many of the cases the recovery rate is very favorable.” “In the worst case, the CDC saying this is a two percent fatality rate,” Keane remarked. “That’s 98 percent survivability, and they think the denominator isn’t quite right yet because there are more people who have it than what they know, and they think that denominator will change, and it may fall into a category that’s much closer to what the flu is, which is 99.9 percent survivability rate.” The U.S. has already seen 22,000 deaths from the flu during this past flu season. According to the CDC, as of March 7, “So far this season there have been at least 36 million flu illnesses, 370,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths from flu.” Keane advised, “I think we should put more emphasis on … the people who are recovering [from coronavirus] and talk to them. Put them on television, and let them tell their fellow Americans what their experience was like. I heard one on television today, and she didn’t have much of anything. She had a cough, and she’s now fully out riding her mountain bike, and she’s exercising. She’s in her sixties. She was in good shape before she got it, and she’s fit as can be now and enjoying life. More things like that, I think, would help contain people’s concern about this.” Keane concluded, “We’re America. We can deal with this. We’ve got the resources. We’ve got the best healthcare system in the world. We’re, generally speaking, a very healthy people to begin with. We’re gonna be okay.” Trump awarded Keane with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Tuesday. Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

"Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is calling on his successor in the state house to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus by cancelling the state’s primary. Blagojevich, who recently had his prison term commutated by President Donald Trump, issued a statement on Monday urging Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) to postpone the presidential and statewide primaries Illinois has scheduled for Tuesday. In making his argument, Blagovjevich pushed the governor to abide by recent Trump administration guidlines calling on Americans to avoid gatherings of ten-or-more and Pritzker’s own decision to close all restaurants and bars in the state for at least two weeks. “I am calling on Gov. Pritzker to listen to the president’s coronavirus task force, health officials, and the scientists and experts … and immediately postpone tomorrow’s primary,” Blagojevich said. The former governor’s call comes as the coronavirus pandemic reaches new heights. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control announced there were more than 24,000 individuals testing positive for the virus. Although the cases are widespread throughout the country, more densely populated states and regions have seen higher numbers of the virus. Despite the patter, Prtizker, who endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday, has refused suggestions he follow the lead of Louisiana and Georgia by rescheduling the primary for a later date. “To expect people to stand in crowded lines, occupying the same space, and suing the voting equipment is not just irresponsible, its dangerous,” Blagojevich said on Monday, asserting that no “citizen should have to choose between running the risk of infecting themsleves and their loved ones, or participating in the democratic process.” “Politics can wait,” he added. “Public health must come first.” Blagojevich, a Democrat, served as governor of Illinois between 2003 and 2009, when he was impeached and removed from office for public corruption. The story generated widespread media attention, especially after it emerged the governor had attempted to sell the senate seat vacated by Barack Obama upon his election to the presidency. In June 2011, Blagojevich was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison, of which he has served nearly eight. The sentence was considered by many to be unduly harsh, given the former governor’s lack of a criminal record. Since emerging from prison, the former governor has been vocal in his defense of the president and has shown a willingness to call out his own party for its abandonment of blue-collar voters. “When I say I’m a Trumpocrat—and hopefully a lot of others are as well, and I believe they are—it’s largely because the Democratic Party has not only left us, but it’s abandoned traditional Democratic constituencies like working people,” Blagojevich told Breitbart News Saturday last month.",Coronavirus: Rod Blagojevich Urges Illinois to Cancel Primaries,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/16/coronavirus-rod-blagojevich-urges-illinois-to-cancel-primaries/,Breitbart
"Monday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said if President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) did not start acting now on the coronavirus outbreak as a nation “we’re in real trouble.” Warren said, “I start this with let’s learn what we should have learned from the 2008 crash. Part one is when we do a stimulus package, it needs to be big enough to meet the moment. If we fail to do that, we’re not going to get a second bite at it politically, and we’ll have a very long and sluggish recovery if we don’t get it big enough the number is $750 billion. Leader Schumer picked up that number later on today and said that looks like a good number as the starting number. That would be about 3.5% of GDP, which is between the estimates right now of 2% to 5% that this may cost us. Part two is we’ve got to make sure that the money is not going to be treetops, that the money is going to the grassroots. That the critical for strengthening this economy. My main parts here, we need to increase Social Security and Disability payments by $200 a month for the next year, make sure that money is coming in. We need to cancel a chunk of student loan debt would be, on average, $400 a month that would stay in the pockets of people who owe a lot of student loan debt. And we need to be putting money into housing. Use this opportunity to restore, repair housing that needs to be done, public housing, build new housing that gives us jobs in the short run, and it gives us housing we need over a longer ark. Those are the kinds of things we can do to help strengthen this economy from the grassroots up, help rebuild this economy and help stabilize it instead of having it crash further, and we need to start now.” Hayes asked, “As you say, we need to start now. Mitch McConnell sent the Senate home for three days for recess and flew to Kentucky, where he was joined by Brett Kavanaugh for a ceremony for a former Kavanaugh clerk. Do you think that was a wise decision by the Senate Majority Leader?” Warren said, “No, it was absolutely irresponsible of the Senate Leader to do that. He ultimately called everyone in for a vote tonight, a vote that did not occur because he worked out a deal. He had a problem in his own party — a deal that could have been worked out last week. And we have still not moved forward on the coronavirus bill. This makes no sense at all. It’s as if he has no sense of urgency about this problem and no sense of what to do.” She added, “You started this by asking, do I feel better trump has at least admitted there is a problem? Sure. But it’s time to act. We should have been acting months ago, and if that message still has not arrived with the president or Mitch McConnell, then we’re in real trouble.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",Warren: If Trump and ‘Irresponsible’ McConnell Don’t Act Now ‘We’re in Real Trouble’,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/16/warren-if-trump-and-irresponsible-mcconnell-dont-act-now-were-in-real-trouble/,Breitbart
"House staffers confirmed on Monday that Democrat House members will indefinitely delay their scheduled March 23 return to the Capitol, due to coronavirus. Aides say Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told House Democrats that the scheduled return will be delayed, with a firm return date still to be determined. “Hoyer said for sure not Monday, and he will update them about the rest of the week,” an aide told The Hill on Monday, adding that travel concerns may affect the decision. “This is all pending domestic travel situation too,” he said The decision arrives at a time when U.S. citizens need action from D.C. leadership more than ever: As the government grapples with appropriate measures to contain the novel coronavirus — and treat its victims — the economy is buckling under the strain. With 40 percent of Americans living just one paycheck away from poverty, taking time off is a life or death decision for people who do not share the luxury of the virtually free health care and paid leave afforded their representatives. Meanwhile, Congress has already passed an $8.3 billion package aimed at addressing the most immediate healthcare concerns, but that is already proving well short of the resources needed. An economic stimulus was passed on Saturday, which Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are already working to correct. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer has also pitched a $750 billion fund for the hospital capacity expansion, bolstering Medicaid coverage, and strengthening unemployment insurance for anyone who loses their job due to the outbreak. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio is focused on keeping the airlines solvent: A source told The Hill that DeFazio “talked about making sure any assistance to airlines puts workers first, and there should be conditions to ensure assistance isn’t used for CEOs or stock buybacks.” It is unclear what effects this indefinite delay in their return will have on these efforts.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden is extending an olive branch to his one time rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), as establishment Democrats look to unify the party and bring the nominating contest to an early conclusion. On Friday, during a virtual town hall with voters in Illinois, Biden announced a major policy shift on bankruptcy reform. While speaking about the burgeoning Coronavirus threat, the former vice president argued that any plan to alleviate the pandemic’s economic impact would have to include an overhaul of personal and student loan bankruptcy laws. Biden did not stop there, though, stating the proposal he had in mind was the same one Warren championed during her failed White House campaign. “I’m going to endorse Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy proposal, which … allows for student debt to be relieved [and] provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us to, in fact, impact how people are dealing with their circumstances,” the former vice president said. He added it was position he likely shared with his progressive rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The political significance of the endorsement was not immediately clear, as much of the news emanating from the town hall focused on its repeated technical difficulties. It does, however, signal that Biden is removing a longstanding point of contention between himself and Warren, likely part of an effort to secure the Massachusett Democrat’s backing. Biden’s courting effort is hinted at by his newfound support for Warren’s bankruptcy proposal, which is nothing short of a repudiation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. That legislation, written in part by Biden, tightened regulations making personal and student loan bankruptcy more difficult. It is widely seen to have benefited credit card companies and big banks at the expense of the average consumer. Some, including Warren, have suggested the law hastened and aggravated the recession of the late 2000s. The story, though, goes much deeper. In 1999, Biden was one of the lead backers of an initial bankruptcy reform package that held many of the provisions that would eventually end up in the 2005 bill. The legislation was a top priority for the banking and credit card interests, specifically MBNA Corp., which at the time was Biden’s largest campaign contributor. Biden, along with a cadre of business-friendly Democrats and Senate Republicans, labored to pass the bill in the face of opposition from liberals and consumer advocates. Among those on the opposing side was then-Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy expert. In opposing the bill, Warren argued the it favored companies like MBNA over working families. After an intense back and forth, Biden’s side prevailed and the bill passed in late 2000. It did not become law, however, as then-President Bill Clinton opted to pocket veto the measure on his way out of office. Biden and his allies were not dispirited by the bill’s failure, instead seizing the opportunity presented by the incoming Republican administration to pass a measure even more beneficial to banking interests. Those efforts ultimately led to the 2005 bill, which only passed after MNBA and other financial giants bankrolled an intense lobbying campaign. The following year, results were evident when bankruptcy filings fell by more than 70 percent. Warren, for her part, has not forgotten Biden’s role in the affair. “At a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hardworking families, Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies,” she said the day after the former vice president entered the 2020 race. Despite the decades-old disagreement, Biden and allies within the Democrat establishment seem to believe an endorsement by Warren is the key to wrapping up the primary. Hopes for a quick conclusion have only grown among establishment Democrats, who fear prolonging the nominating contest will only serve to wound the former vice president in the general election. As such, Warren’s endorsement could prove critical to unifying the party and sapping any remaining momentum Sanders has to fight on. “Sanders would lose a good chunk as a Warren endorsement would signal to progressives that Biden is okay to support,” Colin Strother, a Texas-based political strategist, told Breitbart News. As proof, he pointed to recent polling indicating Sanders narrowly edging out the former vice president as the second choice among Warren supporters. “A Warren endorsement may not result in a huge bump, but the signal would be deafening: Biden is the unity candidate,” he said, noting that a large contingent of Sanders’ “supporters are not really Democrats and do not even identify” as such. Strother added that Biden’s recent actions seemed to imply his campaign had opened up a dialogue with the Massachusetts senator. Although it is unclear if those talks will be successful, Warren at least appears willing to listen. One day before the former vice president endorsed her bankruptcy proposal, Warren’s allies floated to The New York Times that she was unlikely to endorse Sanders, especially as his chances for winning appeared grim. “Why would she want to make her endorsement seem less powerful by giving it to somebody on a downward trajectory,” one of Warren’s allies told the Times.",Biden Offers Warren Olive Branch as Democrats Look to End Primary Early,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/16/biden-offers-warren-olive-branch-as-democrats-look-to-end-primary-early/,Breitbart
"National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera told Breitbart News the “felons only” deportation plan offered by former Vice President Joe Biden will cause a rush to the U.S. The candidate said he would completely halt deportations during his first 100 days and would thereafter only deport felons. “In the first 100 days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all,” Biden said during the Sunday night debate with Senator Bernie Sanders. “From that point on, the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America.” National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol agent currently assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Sector (the nation’s busiest sector), responded to Biden’s pledge, saying, “The rush will come … It’s like ‘we’ll leave the light on for ya.” Cabrera’s comments came on Monday in an interview with Breitbart News Daily’s Alex Marlow. He explained there is normally a border surge in the months leading up to presidential elections as uncertainty builds. “With rhetoric like that,” Cabrera continued, “it’s just going to open the floodgates once again. It will put our guys more at risk and it will put our country more at risk.” “By all means, we need good people coming into this country,” the veteran Border Patrol agent stated, “but you’ve gotta come in the right way, you’ve gotta come in the front door. Not just a blanket ‘everybody comes — nobody leaves — that’s just silly.” Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Marlow reiterated, “All that matters is he’s sending a signal that it’s okay to flood the border. So long as your not a felon, you’re getting in and you’re staying.” Marlow continued, “It’s as though he does not consider that there are human beings whose lives change when he says things like this in order to win the nomination.” Cabrera responded, “It’s very dangerous talk, especially with the fact that some people will do anything to get over here including taking advantage of their fellow man. It puts people in a very bad position.” Click here to listen to Cabrera’s full interview on Breitbart News Today.

"New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (D) signed a coronavirus emergency order last week allowing her to ban the sale and transportation of firearms. She signed a follow-up proclamation on March 16, 2020, further emphasizing her emergency powers to “suspend or limit the sale, dispensing, or transportation, of alcoholic beverages.” The declaration declaring the mayor’s power to restrict gun sales and transportation says she is “empowered, if necessary, to suspend or limit the sale of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives, and combustibles.” On March 16, 2020, the Second Amendment Foundation responded to Cantrell’s claims of emergency powers over firearms by reminding her that they sued over Second Amendment infringement following Hurricane Katrina and will do so during the era of coronavirus if needed. SAF executive vice president Alan Gottlieb said: Following Hurricane Katrina, we sued the city when then-Mayor Ray Nagin’s administration began confiscating firearms from law-abiding citizens for no good reason. The federal court order the city to cease confiscations. We sued New Orleans then, and we’ll do it again. The presence of a nasty disease does not suspend any part of the Bill of Rights, no matter what some municipal, state or even federal politician may think. While we certainly recognize the seriousness of this virus and its ability to spread rapidly, treating Covid-19 and taking steps to prevent it from infecting more people has nothing at all to do with the exercise of the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Gottlieb added, “People legally licensed to carry should not have their right to do so suddenly curtailed because some politician panicked. We didn’t allow it before, and we’re not going to allow it now.” On March 14, 2020, Breitbart News reported that Champaign, Illinois, Mayor Deborah Frank Feinen (D) issued an emergency coronavirus order that gives her the power to halt ammunition and firearm sales in the city.

"During an interview that aired on Monday’s broadcast of Fox Business Network’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) explained what led to his hesitation to support legislation meant to ease the economic blow from coronavirus. Gohmert pointed to a family leave provision in the bill, which only applied to companies with less than 500 employees. Partial transcript as follows: DOBBS: Let’s turn to the coronavirus bill that you — that you put a hold on. Got a deal I understand, but still 20 pages, I’ll bet you that you’re right still, that a lot of folks don’t have any idea what’s in it. GOHMERT: Yes. Well — and that was the problem Friday night. Yes, we voted — started voting around 12:30 A.M. Saturday morning, but that bill didn’t get filed until right before midnight. Now I had — I had read through the 108 pages of the 9 o’clock or so version, but I didn’t have time to compare them and do a side by side. I didn’t know what got changed or what didn’t. But it really bugged me — you know, under Obamacare that passed without a single Republican vote, they exempted all businesses with less than 50 employees. This bill that’s going to force small businesses — one, two, three, up to 50 — well up to 500 actually — employees. They’re going to have to be providing an opportunity to take family leave and all. And — and these are folks — if you’ve got two employees, and you’re going to be able to give them both a month off you’ve got trouble. DOBBS: Let me tell you what, if — if — if the White House — if the White House hasn’t got anymore influence over legislation than that, we’re going to have a real problem come November, because this is a time to be straight up, straight forward for both parties. GOHMERT: That’s right. DOBBS: Now the Democrats are very clearly not. The Republicans had better be and follow this president’s lead. GOHMERT: Well, how ironic, Lou, that this bill exempts the corporations with over 500 employees. How about that? They were — what is the deal? They were — they complain about the big corporations, and yet they exempted them and they said, well, a lot of them already have paid family leave. DOBBS: Right.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio flouted his own city’s coronavirus guidelines to work out at the Brooklyn YMCA on Monday morning. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is already facing sharp criticism for his response — or relative lack thereof — to the novel coronavirus, officially classified as “COVID-19,” global pandemic. De Blasio has, until Monday, resisted school closures, putting millions of families at risk of exposure to the contagion. The mayor took so long to course-correct that upset staffers reportedly chose to quit rather than continue supporting his leadership. “We understand the immense disruption this will create for our families,” United Federation of Teachers president Michael Mulgrew said. “But right now, more than a million students and staff crisscross the city every day on their way to schools, putting themselves and others at risk of exposure and increasing the likelihood of bringing exposure into their homes and communities.” And despite declaring the pandemic a “war” over which the federal government should “take over” on Sunday and making a case for government nationalization of “crucial factories and industries” to produce medical supplies, de Blasio does not appear to believe these rules should necessarily apply to him. Our crazy Mayor, as he's deciding to close all the gyms, because they're not safe…………goes to the gym to workout: https://t.co/sKBGY1k3Xs — MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) March 16, 2020  “Our crazy Mayor, as he’s deciding to close all the gyms, because they’re not safe … goes to the gym to workout,” New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday, linking to a report by the New York Post. He is far from the only one shocked by the decision. De Blasio’s own people have called him out. “He went to the f–king gym? Jesus!” said a former staff member. Another told the Post, “every New Yorker’s regular routine has been put on hold. His should be, too. Get to work. Set an example. This is embarrassing.” Yet another questioned his unwillingness to adhere to CDC guidelines, telling the paper: Didn’t the CDC recommend no gatherings of 50 people or more? … Will he be counting the amount of people there and leaving if it’s over 49? If we’re supposed to be social distancing, then what does that even mean if he gets to play by his own rules? Leaders are supposed to set by example. What kind of example does this set? Also, why is he at the gym and not hunkered down 24/7 working on this? It’s a pandemic, and people are dying. Stunning. How many people have to die before he stops getting chauffeured to the gym is my question. What’s the appropriate number of deaths before he finds it uncouth? De Blasio’s press secretary, Freddi Goldstein, defended the mayor’s risky decision. “The YMCA has been a huge part of his and his family’s life, like it has been for a lot of New Yorkers. It’s clear that’s about to change and before that, the mayor wanted to visit a place that keeps him grounded one last time,” Goldstein said. “That doesn’t change the fact that he is working around the clock to ensure the safety of New Yorkers. After today, gyms will close and he will no longer be visiting the YMCA for the foreseeable future.” After his 12-mile trip to his favorite gym, de Blasio finally decided it was time to make sure the children of New York had adequate protection. “It is time to take more drastic measures,” de Blasio said during an update at City Hall Sunday evening, announcing that schools would be closed until at least April 20. “This is a decision I have taken with no joy whatsoever.” But NYC Council Member Keith Powers implored de Blasio to live by his own words. “As elected officials, we’re expected to lead and set an example for the public,” he wrote. “We’re in a public health crisis, where gyms and restaurants are closing. Our message to everyone is to stay home. Mr. Mayor, we need you to lead by example.”",NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio Ignores Coronavirus Rules to Hit the Gym,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio-ignores-coronavirus-rules-to-hit-the-gym/,Breitbart

"The local Illinois news station WCIA mistakenly aired Election Day results on Monday, showing former Vice President Joe Biden (D) winning, the day before the state’s Tuesday primary election. A video went viral on Monday, showing WCIA airing Tuesday’s election results during a Monday showing of The Price is Right. The results showed Biden defeating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) by just over 93,000 votes. “While watching The Price is Right our station accidentally runs tomorrow’s election results … its [sic] Monday our election in Illinois is tomorrow,” the woman, Sherry Daughtery, wrote alongside a video:  She updated her post with a statement from Mark Maxwell, the station’s Capitol Bureau Chief, who said it was nothing more than a “routine test” rehearsal. Airing the dry run, he said, was an error. He stressed that the numbers were not based on any actual polling returns and added that the station “never intended to give the wrong information or wrong impression”: We do routine test rehearsals before every election to make sure the graphics work properly and to give directors some practice. The error was in putting the dry run on air. That shouldn’t have happened and we’re looking into it. Obviously, we never intended to give the wrong information or wrong impression. None of those numbers were based on any real polling returns. Since your post is being widely shared, I’d appreciate it if you would consider updating the original post so people don’t get the wrong idea. Breitbart News reached out to Maxwell, who verified that he did, in fact, make a “truthful” statement. Officials in Illinois have not canceled the state’s primary election, despite Gov. J.B. Pritzker taking drastic measures by announcing the closure of restaurants and bars across the state as fears over the coronavirus continue to mount. Pritzker remained confident in holding the election as scheduled, telling NBC’s Meet the Press that officials have been “extra-careful at all of our polling places.”  “Everybody is practicing good hygiene. And we’re making sure that it’s safe for people to come and vote,” he said on Sunday. “The schools are closed, so many people will be voting in schools.

"At least eight New York Times authors shared a deceptively edited quote Monday from President Donald Trump’s recent call with state governors, creating the false impression that the president is denying federal support for ventilators that are needed in hospitals treating coronavirus patients. In his message, the president recommended that states procure respirators and ventilators because it would be faster — but added that the federal government “will be backing you.” The Times journalists omitted the bulk of the president’s statement as they shared the story on social media. The misleading, partial quote was also boosted by a CNN correspondent and became the lead headline at the left-wing Huffington Post. Despite growing online backlash to this misinformation, the journalists have yet to delete or retract their comments. The eight journalists tweeted a link to a Times article published Monday that contains President Trump’s full statement to state governors in which the president recommended that they shouldn’t wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to treat people with coronavirus. “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” President Trump told the governors during the Monday conference call. “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” But in the body of their posts, the Times journalists left out most of what the president said. Times national correspondent Julie Bosman tweeted only the first third of the president’s statement, leaving out the part where he said the federal government will back the states. Wow. “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call. via @jmartNYT  https://t.co/RKZusLK5oY — Julie Bosman (@juliebosman) March 16, 2020  Bosman, reacting to intense backlash, defended herself by inaccurately claiming that “the second part of the quote repeats the first part, twice.” In fact, the second part of the president’s statement says that the federal government “will be backing you [the states].” because the second part of the quote repeats the first part, twice. — Julie Bosman (@juliebosman) March 16, 2020  Mara Gay, a member of the Times editorial board, also left out most of what the president said. She also falsely accused the president of telling governors that  “they are on their own.” In actuality, the president said in his full quote that the federal government “will be backing you.” Trump told governors this morning they are on their own:  “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times. https://t.co/K0sont7MBc — Mara Gay (@MaraGay) March 16, 2020  Just ten days ago, Gay was involved in another embarrassing episode for corporate media, where she and MSNBC anchor Brian Williams horribly botched basic math to claim that billionaire Michael Bloomberg could have “given every American a million dollars.” In reality, the amount he spent amounts to less than $2 per person.

"President Donald Trump has made significant strides in the energy sector, including making the United States the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world, but at the Democrat debate on Sunday both candidates vowed to dismantle those gains in the name of climate change and the “corporate greed” of fossil fuel producers. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) both promised to “take on the fossil fuel industry,” including ending hydraulic fracking that had enhanced production and reduced emissions, shutting down coal plants, and ending drilling for oil and gas on public lands. “This is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines,” Sanders said. “What this is about transforming our energy system, as quickly as we humanly can, away from fossil fuel.” “It is insane that we continue to have fracking in America,” Sanders said. “Number one, no more subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one,” Biden said. He added: Number two, we’re in a situation, as well, where we cannot — we — we are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic in terms of what we can do to set in motion — the fact that he says climate change, Paris Accord doesn’t mean much — we can get everything exactly right.

Biden said he would call on the Department of Defense to fight the “national security” threat of climate change and claimed “islands are sinking.” As Breitbart News reported during the American Conservative Union’s 2020 CPAC convention last month in Oxon Hill, Maryland, Department of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told Breitbart News Daily about Trump’s vision for a “secure, energy independent” nation. “Here’s the contrast,” Bernhardt said. “The socialists have come up with the concept of the great Green New Deal.” “Which, really, they even admit, is a policy to control the lives of Americans,” Bernhardt said. “You contrast that with President Trump’s vision for America, which has been to unleash our energy potential on federal lands and eliminate the paralysis by analysis that’s been caused by regulation.” “Regulations have literally gotten to the point where they were so burdensome that they were freezing the government from making decisions,” Bernhardt said. “And the president came in and said, ‘Look, let’s ensure that we have clean air, clean water, health, and human safety, but let’s find a way to do those things — maintain those values — and at the same time have a common sense approach to the business that we need to have in our country to fast-track economic opportunity, to develop natural resources.’” Bernhardt said over the past three years his agency has worked to “dramatically modify our regulatory paradigm in a way that didn’t sacrifice those high values but at the same time dramatically has allowed us speed up our decision making process.” “The United States has become a net energy exporter, which was really not thought of years ago,” Bernhardt said. “And largely because of American innovation and technology through the utilization of new development techniques, and those techniques started in the mid-2000s and really benefited private land.” “When we come into office the president recognized that there was an opportunity for those technologies to be more utilized on public land,” Bernhardt said, referring to hydraulic fracturing, a technology that has been around since 1862 but reached its peak performance over the last few decades. As the largest manager of land in the United States, DOI has a huge responsibility, Bernhardt said. “Interior alone manages one of every five acres of land in the United States,” Bernhardt said.  “What we’ve done responsibly is allow people to move forward with proposals that have dramatically improved things,” Bernhardt said. “This year for the first time ever we had on federal lands and Indian lands that we manage together over one billion barrels of oil were produced.” Bernhardt said that DOI has increased the number of permits for drilling wells by 300 percent. “And the revenue to the American public has dramatically increased — nearly doubled,” Bernhardt said, adding that energy independence has also bolstered national security when the United States is not dependent on nations that may not have our country’s best interests in mind. “We have fundamentally changed the game and that is really a testament to [Trump’s] belief in American innovation, American technology and [a] commonsense regulatory paradigm,” Bernhardt said. Bernhardt also said at CPAC that President Donald Trump has made it a priority to give Americans access to federal lands for both pleasure and business: In keeping with that goal, Bernhardt said that his agency is committed to making sure that 245 million acres in the western United States be “specifically designated to be managed for multiple use.” “We’ve expanded by 1.4 million acres this last year as opportunities for hunting and fishing on public lands and in forests, but more importantly we have ensured the concept of multiple use is embodied,” Bernhardt said. “So we are open for business in many places for public lands and at the same time ensuring that we maintain our conservation stewardship,” Bernhardt said.  Follow Penny Starr on Twitter","Sanders, Biden Vow at Democrat Debate to Undo U.S. Energy Independence",2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/sanders-biden-vow-at-democrat-debate-to-undo-u-s-energy-independence/,Breitbart

"In another desperate attempt by the Clinton machine to delay truth and accountability for her email conduct and how it impacted the people’s “right to know” under FOIA, lawyers for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills have asked the Court of Appeals to overturn a U.S. District court order granting Judicial Watch’s request for their depositions about Clinton’s emails and Benghazi attack records. Lawyers for Clinton and Mills filed a “Petition for Writ of Mandamus” earlier today. The Clinton request comes in Judicial Watch’s lawsuit that seeks records concerning “talking points or updates on the Benghazi attack” (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01242)). Judicial Watch famously uncovered in 2014 that the “talking points” that provided the basis for Susan Rice’s false statements were created by the Obama White House. This Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit led directly to the disclosure of the Clinton email system in 2015. On March 3, 2020, Judge Lamberth granted Judicial Watch’s request to depose Clinton about her emails and Benghazi attack documents. The court also ordered the deposition of Mills and two other State Department officials. Additionally, the court granted Judicial Watch’s request to subpoena Google for relevant documents and records associated with Clinton’s emails during her tenure at the State Department. In December 2018, Judge Lamberth first ordered discovery into whether Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server was intended to stymie FOIA; whether the State Department’s intent to settle this case in late 2014 and early 2015 amounted to bad faith; and whether the State Department has adequately searched for records responsive to Judicial Watch’s request. The court also authorized discovery into whether the Benghazi controversy motivated the cover-up of Clinton’s email. The court ruled that the Clinton email system was “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.” The State and Justice Departments continued to defend Clinton’s and the agency’s email conduct. Judge Lamberth overruled Clinton’s and the State and Justice Department’s objections to limited additional discovery by first noting: Discovery up until this point has brought to light a noteworthy amount of relevant information, but Judicial Watch requests an additional round of discovery, and understandably so. With each passing round of discovery, the Court is left with more questions than answers. Additionally, Judge Lamberth said that he is troubled by the fact that both the State Department and Department of Justice want to close discovery in this case: [T]here is still more to learn. Even though many important questions remain unanswered, the Justice Department inexplicably still takes the position that the court should close discovery and rule on dispositive motions. The Court is especially troubled by this. To argue that the Court now has enough information to determine whether State conducted an adequate search is preposterous, especially when considering State’s deficient representations regarding the existence of additional Clinton emails. Instead, the Court will authorize a new round of discovery … With respect to Clinton, the court found that her prior testimony, mostly through written sworn answers, was not sufficient: The Court has considered the numerous times in which Secretary Clinton said she could not recall or remember certain details in her prior interrogatory answers. In a deposition, it is more likely that plaintiff’s counsel could use documents and other testimony to attempt to refresh her recollection. And so, to avoid the unsatisfying and inefficient outcome of multiple rounds of fruitless interrogatories and move this almost six-year-old case closer to its conclusion, Judicial Watch will be permitted to clarify and further explore Secretary Clinton’s answers in person and immediately after she gives them. The Court agrees with Judicial Watch – it is time to hear directly from Secretary Clinton. Judicial Watch will continue the fight to hold Clinton accountable and to bring out the truth for all to see.",Fitton: Hillary Clinton Appeals Federal Court Order to Go Under Oath,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/fitton-hillary-clinton-appeals-federal-court-order-to-go-under-oath/,Breitbart
"Thousands of foreign nationals have been caught attempting to cross into the United States from Canada before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would close the nation’s borders to foreign travelers. On Monday, Trudeau said he would be shutting down Canada’s borders to non-citizens with exemptions for permanent Canadian residents, diplomats, aircrews, and American citizens. Before the announcement, Trudeau had not issued a single travel ban — not even for China, Iran, South Korea, or Italy. Federal data obtained by Breitbart News shows that nearly 10,400 foreign nationals were deemed inadmissible or apprehended at the U.S.-Canada border in January and February. In January, alone, northern border agents encountered nearly 3,600 foreign nationals. In February, northern border agents apprehended 259 foreign nationals and declared 6,540 inadmissible. These inadmissible numbers and apprehensions do not include the foreign nationals who have arrived at northern border ports of entry and have successfully entered the U.S. President Trump said his administration is considering closing the northern border as the number of coronavirus cases in Canada climbs to 304. Thus far, there has been one death from the coronavirus in Canada. “We think about it … if we don’t have to do it, that would be very good,” Trump said when asked if he would close the northern border. “… We’re talking about different things.” As Breitbart News reported, the U.S.-Mexico border has been inundated with foreign nationals from coronavirus-affected countries. Since October, nearly 151,000 foreign nationals from 72 countries with confirmed coronavirus cases have flocked to the southern border. Within the last few months, more than 340 Chinese nationals have attempted to cross illegally into the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Over 450 employees of Duval County Public Schools (DCPS), covering the school district in Jacksonville, Florida, have reported the need to self-quarantine, according to local media. The development follows a recent survey asking employees to indicate their whereabouts over spring break. As such, the district has asked “any students, teachers or staff returning from foreign travel to any country or anyone who returns from a cruise, anywhere” to remain in self-isolation for two weeks, according to News4Jax. The DCPS states on its website in a note to parents and families: If you have traveled out of the continental United States, if you have been on a cruise, or if a member of your close family participated in any such travel, you must not return to school until you have self-isolated for 14 days and you are symptom-free. According to Action News Jax, the employees “have been provided guidance from Dr. Diana Greene, according to the district.” Meanwhile, the district has announced that it will provide “grab and go” school lunches for all students beginning March 17. The news comes as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis orders schools across the state to extend their spring breaks by a week amid festering coronavirus concerns.

"President Trump’s coronavirus travel bans have been effective in refusing air travel entry to the United States for Chinese nationals, Iranian nationals, and recent visitors to either of those countries. On January 31, Trump announced a travel ban on Chinese nationals and foreign travelers who had visited China within the last 14 days. There are now nearly 81,000 coronavirus cases in China and 3,213 deaths. About a month later, Trump expanded the travel ban to include Iran, where more than 850 have died from the Wuhan, China, virus. Between February 2 and March 12, Trump’s travel bans have made sure a total of about 143 foreign air travelers — who have visited or resided in China or Iran  — were not allowed entry to the U.S., according to federal data obtained by Breitbart News. At American airports, 18 foreign nationals were refused entry to the U.S. over the last five weeks. Meanwhile, 125 foreign nationals were denied from ever boarding U.S.-bound flights thanks to the travel ban restrictions. These denials were conducted during pre-clearance locations at international airports. Breitbart News previously reported on the latest number of denials of entry at land ports of entry thanks to the travel ban restrictions, where nearly 240 foreign nationals were kept out of the U.S. This brings the total of foreign nationals refused entry to the U.S. due to the travel bans, via land ports of entry and air travel, to 380 thus far. This data does not include the number of Europeans and recent European travelers who will have been kept from entering the U.S. because that travel ban went into effect on Friday, March 13. While the Trump administration has implemented the travel bans and stopped most migration from highly-affected coronavirus countries, about 220 House Democrats have sought to strip the president of his authority to enact travel bans. The “No Ban Act,” introduced by Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA) would have prevented Trump from immediately implementing a travel ban on China once the outbreak of the coronavirus spread past its origins of Wuhan. Instead, the No Ban Act would have allowed travelers from Wuhan, Iran, Italy, and all of Europe to continue to arrive in the U.S. while the president received guidance from Congress. The leading 2020 Democrats for president, Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have both vowed not to implement travel bans if they are president — even in cases like the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Biden’s “combat coronavirus” plan did not include a single travel ban — not even for Wuhan, where the virus originated — while Sanders has explicitly said he would not close the nation’s borders to any country if elected president.

"Former Department of Justice prosecutor Jonathan Kravis, one of four prosecutors who withdrew from the Roger Stone case last month after President Donald Trump criticized their recommended sentence, appears to have a history of asking for long sentences in politically controversial cases. Kravis, who not only left the case but also left government altogether, joined his team in recommending a seven- to nine-year sentence for Stone, a first offender. As Breitbart News reported: “Stone was convicted in November on seven criminal counts, including making false statements to Congress regarding his communications with WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential election, tampering with witness Randy Credico, and obstructing the House investigation into the president’s now-debunked coordination with Russia.” But the lengthy sentence drew criticism — including from President Trump himself. Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature, yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee, that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp! @foxandfriends @TuckerCarlson — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2020  Attorney General William Barr intervened, and Stone was ultimately sentenced to 40 months. Barr said that Trump had not influenced his decision, and took the unusual step of criticizing the president’s tweets on ABC News. Jury foreperson Tomeka Hart then outed herself in a Facebook post defending the prosecutors. That, in turn, revealed her own history as a Democratic Party politician, and her intense bias against Trump. Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, who has specialized in appeals by defendants against convictions in similar cases, said that Stone deserved a new trial. Kravis and his fellow prosecutors nonetheless remained heroes in the eyes of much of the mainstream media. In 2016, Kravis was involved in the prosecution of Herbert Vederman, the former deputy mayor of Philadelphia, who was convicted of bribing former Congressman Chaka Fattah, who was also convicted. Vederman was sentenced to 24 months in prison — four times the maximum sentence provided in the federal guidelines, which is six months. Vederman’s conviction was overturned in 2019. He was set to face a new trial, but decided to strike a plea deal for one year in prison instead. However, the judge threw out the deal and sentenced Vederman to two years anyway, after prosecutors recommended a sentence of at least 24 months. Vederman has petitioned for commutation of his sentence, telling the Office of the Pardon Attorney, “Mr. Kravis’s record should be investigated, and my sentence should be commuted.” Kravis also prosecuted three former campaign staffers for Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) for crimes involved in an effort to entice an Iowa politician to switch his endorsement to Paul from presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) in the 2012 Republican primary. Several of the charges were dismissed by a federal judge “because they were based on information the government obtained during F.B.I. interviews last year that the judge said was not admissible,” the New York Times reported. (The three were later convicted in another trial.) It is not clear bias played a role in the Stone prosecution. But the media rush to defend the prosecutors and to impugn Barr’s motives ignored the question of possible bias entirely. Joel B.

"Immigration advocates are worrying out loud that China’s Wuhan epidemic will reduce public support for migration into the United States. “The Coronavirus Is Killing Globalization as We Know It,” says a headline at ForeignPolicy.com by Phillippe Legrain, a self-described “cosmopolitan” supporter of migration, and an aide to left-wing European politicians. “The outbreak has been a gift to nativist nationalists and protectionists, and it is likely to have a long-term impact on the free movement of people and goods,” Legrai worried in a March 12 article. He continued: Much of this disruption may be temporary. But the coronavirus crisis is likely to have a lasting impact, especially when it reinforces other trends that are already undermining globalization. It may deal a blow to fragmented international supply chains, reduce the hypermobility of global business travelers, and provide political fodder for nationalists who favor greater protectionism and immigration controls. … Once the pandemic and panic abate, those who believe that openness to people and products from around the world is generally a good thing will need to make the case for it in fresh and persuasive ways. The worries were echoed by Ali Noorani, director of the National Immigration Forum. This pro-migration group is subsidized by employers who are eager to hire refugees and migrants at wages far below the income sought by American parents. The 1918 flu helped build public support for the 1925 Immigration Act that drastically reduced the flow of migrants, he warned in Medium.com, adding: All of this was long before our globalized, integrated, economy; before the information bubbles that sharply define public opinion; and, most importantly, before the rise of today’s powers that look to demagogue immigrants and immigration. Already, one side of the narrative is shaped by claims the virus came from a backward, corrupt, unclean China, facilitated by Democrats’ open-borders ideology, only to be stopped by travel bans. What is stopping the rhetoric getting even worse? Noorani’s NIF is backed by companies such as Walmart, because it helps raise the labor supply and the inflow of new consumers. He and his allies are already facing growing public opposition to legal and illegal migration, which transfers wealth from young wage-earners to older shareholders, and from the heartland to the coastal states. As Trump and the federal government try to mitigate the disease via “social distancing,” Noorani writes: a consequence of social distancing is, well, social distancing. As Lyman Stone wrote in Foreign Policy, “Bereft of work, school, public gatherings, sports and hobbies, or even the outside world at all, humans do poorly. We need the moral and mental support of communities to be the decent people we all aspire to be.” Churches take their services online, schools close, sporting events are shuttered. The political and social divide that defines our times grows wider. Into the [political] vacuum created by these necessary measures [against the disease] will step powerful forces. Their goal will be to breed mistrust, fan the flames of xenophobia and turn Americans against “the other.” Democrats have begun trying to prevent any political link between Americans’ immigration policy and the Chinese epidemic, usually by stigmatizing critics of migration as mentally ill “xenophobes.” “The global response to COVID-19 has made clear that the fear of contracting disease has an ugly cousin: xenophobia,” claimed a March 4 report at NPR. “As the coronavirus has spread from China to other countries, anti-Asian discrimination has followed closely behind.” “Nationalism is the exactly wrong approach to take to a global pandemic, where the solution requires a worldwide pooling of medical resources,” the Nation declared March 13, as many nations around the world shut their borders to foreign travelers. “We have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus,” Biden said in Iowa, according to a February 1 report in TheHill.com. “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.” Other migration activists are hoping the China-origin crisis will help them import more migrants, including Chinese migrants. “As Congress prepares a legislative response to the [coronavirus] crisis, it should consider completely exempting all pharmaceutical researchers and scientists as well as doctors and physicians from the H-1B and green card limits and expediting their processing,” says an op-ed by David Bier, an advocate at the Cato Institute. The institute is a libertarian advocacy center founded by an open borders champion, Charles Koch. The federal government should respond to the epidemic by putting roughly 1.2 million Indians — some of whom are doctors — on a fast-track to green cards and citizenship, says Immigration Voice, an activist group for Indian contract workers who hold white-collar jobs in the United States. The group is aggressively lobbying for passage of a Senate bill S.386, by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), that would reward hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates for taking jobs from American graduates. The lobbying is directed at Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill), who recognizes that the gain for Silicon Valley’s imported Indian workforce would shrink the supply of green cards for scientists and graduates from many other countries. “83% of doctoral-level foreign scientists hired by pharmaceutical companies were not in the major [Indian] group of the current green card backlog,” said a tweet by one of the many grassroots groups opposing the Lee S.386 bill. “S.386 will eliminate all of these important scientific human resources of the U.S.” Cato & Koch: Never lose an opportunity to cut salaries for American graduates. FWIW, Congress allows non-profit research centers to hire an unlimited number of foreign grads in place of US grads.

"Trump administration officials warned the public on Monday that a foreign disinformation campaign is trying to incite panic over a non-existent national lockdown over coronavirus. An unnamed “senior official” told Fox News that “there is an ongoing effort to spread disinformation and cause undue panic” among U.S. citizens, but confirmed, “there is no national quarantine for the United States.” Now, more than ever, “it’s important we remain vigilant in ensuring our information is coming from verified sources,” they said. The Associated Press received similar communication from the White House, warning of “a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to sow fears of a nationwide quarantine amid the virus outbreak.” These officials also spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to name the source of the campaign. On Sunday, the National Security Council tweeted: “Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown,” and encouraged Americans to pay attention to CDC guidance instead. Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE.

The aggressor then, too, remained unidentified. “U.S. officials have not yet confirmed who was behind the HHS hacking. The hack yesterday involved overloading the HHS servers with millions of hits over several hours,” Bloomberg learned from unnamed sources. At his Monday press briefing, even President Donald Trump alluded to foreign powers “playing games” with coronavirus information. He confirmed that there were no nationwide travel restrictions and that even domestic travel continues as normal, aside from screenings. Still, he told Americans that he and the experts are “talking about it every day.”",Report: Foreign Coronavirus Disinformation Campaign Trying to Cause U.S. Panic,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/report-foreign-coronavirus-disinformation-campaign-trying-to-cause-u-s-panic/,Breitbart
"The Pentagon said Monday it has not yet received any requests from other government agencies for medical facilities, equipment, and personnel, but is looking at options to help deal with a potential coronavirus crisis in the United States if needed. Chief Pentagon Spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman said: We are looking at a number of different options with regard to resources and what we can do. We’ve done that analysis and are continuing to do it, and…it can be provided up to the president and the White House for making decisions as requests come in. Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Fredrichs, surgeon at the Joint Staff, added: “Yes we do have plans looking at the capabilities that we have and then if we’re asked to provide them or if we’re tasked to say what’s in the realm of the possible, we can look at those plans.” Both officials, however, underlined that there are limits to the what the military can provide, and that it could come with tradeoffs. Fredrichs said, for instance, if military reserve medical personnel are activated, that takes them away from their civilian medical job. “That directly impacts the community where they work. That’s the tradeoff,” he said. Fredrichs said there are only 36 Pentagon hospitals in the United States that are “relatively small hospitals,” or under 1,000 beds. He said many of them are configured to support military needs. Civilian leaders have been increasingly pressing for military intervention. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo urged in an op-ed to President Trump on Monday morning that the military build hospital beds. Hoffman said the Pentagon has not yet received a request to construct anything. He said: We have not received an RFA or request to actually do any construction, that would be something that we would look at. At this time I think there are some other options out there that we’ve seen, private companies that are able to do some of the construction, there are other facilities, but we have not been asked to take a look at that yet but we are standing by to look at RFAs as they come and work with the White House on deciding how we best support those. And Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Sunday during a debate called for the military to provide 500-bed hospital tents. Hoffman said the Pentagon is looking into how fast those could be deployed, but he and Fredrichs also warned against “overpromising.” Fredrichs said: We want to be factual about what we have, our fixed facilities are designed to the force that we have — they’re not 1,000-bed medical centers all over the United States. Our deployable hospitals range in size and range in capabilities and are very focused and designed to take care of those in combat. Hoffman added that with regards to tent hospitals, personnel is a limiting factor. “Even if we are able to build tents for hospitals, we still need the doctors, we still need the nurses, we need the orderlies, we need the equipment — all that in there, and as the general mentioned, those individuals from our system would come from existing hospitals or the reserves.” He said the Pentagon has only two to three percent of hospital beds compared to what the civilian side has. As far as how many ventilators the Pentagon could provide, Hoffman said the department is not prepared to give that number out, since it would expose deployable medical capability. On whether the military could be asked to perform law enforcement functions, Hoffman said, “The governors have the ability to call up the National Guard as they see fit.”   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.",Pentagon Looking at Options to Help Coronavirus Response,2020-03-16,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/16/pentagon-looking-at-options-to-help-coronavirus-response/,Breitbart
"The world must look to China, pay attention and follow its principles in order to halt the global spread of the coronavirus, the official Communist China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday. Despite the fact coronavirus was first discovered last year in the city of Wuhan, where officials tried for six weeks to conceal the deadly outbreak, China is increasingly trying to recast itself as a global leader on the treatment of the pandemic. To that end it is issuing guidance and instruction for other countries to follow, with the full support of the United Nations and World Health Organization functionaries, although not everyone is buying the propaganda push: Sen. @MarcoRubio is standing up against the communist Chinese regime.  https://t.co/RtvEKRW9CA — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 17, 2020  The China Daily editorial said Singapore, Japan and South Korea had all “based their responses on the experience and lessons drawn from China’s successful battle with the virus”, and China was now “proactively sharing” its best practices. At the same time the Communist regime is disappointed not all countries are paying attention, increasing the possibility that the epidemic will get worse, the newspaper said: Despite the unmistakable seriousness of the situation, some countries have tried to play down the risks, and the measures they have taken are not only insufficient to control the pandemic at home, but also not enough to prevent themselves from being the source of virus transmission to other countries. Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday attempts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to curb the Wuhan virus would not succeed, and could lead to retaliation. His appeal drew a sharp response from Pompeo who conveyed “strong objections” to Yang over what the State Department described as “PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” as Breitbart News reported. Over the past few weeks, Chinese officials and state-managed social media accounts began floating theories that the coronavirus began in the United States and was brought to Wuhan by U.S. Army soldiers visiting for the Military World Games in October. Thursday’s allegations from the Chinese Foreign Ministry that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in America and was spread to China by the U.S. military was not a fluke or an example of a rogue spokesman running his mouth. https://t.co/1Jt5KSCYpo — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 14, 2020  On Monday a major Chinese Communist Party paper, the Global Times, stated again – without evidence – the virus might have been developed in the U.S. Army laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, before being secretly released to harm an innocent and entirely helpless mainland Chinese populace.","China Commands World to Pay Attention, Follow Its Lead in Coronavirus Fight",2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/17/china-commands-world-to-pay-attention-follow-its-lead-in-coronavirus-fight/,Breitbart
"Devout Muslim Shiite followers in Iran fought their way into two major shrines closed over coronavirus fears, Iranian state media reported Tuesday, as they demanded the right to continue worshipping practices that include kissing, touching and in some cases licking sacred public objects. As the Islamic Republic pressed on with its struggle to control the Mideast’s worst Chinese coronavirus outbreak, angry crowds stormed into the courtyards of Mashhad’s Imam Reza shrine and Qom’s Fatima Masumeh shrine. The faithful typically pray there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, touching and kissing the shrine. That’s worried health officials, who for weeks ordered Iran’s Shiite clergy to shutter them. Earlier on Monday, the state TV had announced the shrines’ closure, sparking the mass protests. “We are here to say that Tehran is damn wrong to do that!” one Shiite cleric shouted at the shrine in Mashhad, according to online video. Others joined him in chanting: “The health minister is damn wrong to do that, the president is damn wrong to do that!” As Breitbart News reported, strict Muslim religious observance has clashed before with state control in Iran. Earlier this month online videos emerged showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they have no fear of infection during the country’s escalating coronavirus outbreak. More videos are emerging of people licking the shrines in the city of Qom #CoronaVirus, the epicentre of the epidemic in Iran.  Iran's authorities still adamantly refuse to close these religious sites. The virus is wreaking havoc all over the country pic.twitter.com/veCQd6ots6 — Masih Alinejad 🏳️ (@AlinejadMasih) March 1, 2020  Touching and kissing surfaces in shrines is a common practice for Muslim pilgrims, and religious hardliners argue the holy sites of Qom are “a place for healing” that the government has no right to close down. Iran’s shrines draw Shiites from all over the Mideast for pilgrimages, likely contributing to the spread of the virus across the region. Saudi Arabia earlier closed off Islam’s holiest sites over fear of the virus spreading. President Hassan Rouhani said despite the closures, “our soul is closer to the saints more than at any time.” Iran warned Monday the coronavirus pandemic could overwhelm local health facilities as the death toll topped 700 and another senior lawmaker died from the disease, as Breitbart News reported.

"Britain’s Chief Scientific Adviser has told the public that the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus is a “national effort” in which everyone must play a part. “We have now entered the delay phase of this pandemic and we want to delay the spread and reduce its effects,” wrote Sir Patrick Vallance, who is also head of the Government Science and Engineering (GSE) profession, in an article published on the Government’s website. “This is response to the current spread of the disease in the UK that reflects the fact that we are few weeks behind some countries in terms of the outbreak of the disease [sic],” he added. The former GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) research and development executive stressed that “we need… experts more than ever… we need their voices, and their advice, to be full, frank and honest” — but the question of why the Government did not take steps to end travel from China, Iran, Italy, and other heavily-infected countries long ago in order to slow the virus’s arrival and spread in the United Kingdom, went unanswered. It's time, to paraphrase @realDonaldTrump, for a complete shutdown of travel from China until our countries' representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. #coronavirus #wuhan  https://t.co/ebC1T8U42S — Jack Montgomery (@JackBMontgomery) January 28, 2020  “We all have a crucial part to play” in “taking steps to squash the peak” of the epidemic, Sir Patrick told readers, stating that the coronavirus “is a mild disease in most people” but adding that it was nevertheless “paramount that we do everything possible to protect ourselves, to protect others, and protect the NHS.” In terms of practical steps to, as he put it, “squash the peak”, his advice to people with coronavirus symptoms was to stay at home for seven days, while for the rest of the public the advice was much the same as always: For people without symptoms we have 4 simple words of advice: Keep. Washing. Your. Hands. Wash them often, wash them even when wouldn’t you normally wash them, and wash them with soap for 20 seconds at a time. I’ve opted for Prince’s, Raspberry Beret as my own personal handwash song [sic]. You can choose your own. After Sir Patrick’s article was published on the gov.uk website, however, the Government’s advice has escalated, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sir Patrick, and Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty giving a press conference later that same day saying it was now time for “drastic action”. The trio advised people with coronavirus symptoms to self-isolate along with the rest of their household for 14 days — up from seven — and advised all members of the public to “stop non-essential contact with others and to stop unnecessary travel”. “We need people to start working from home where they possibly can and you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres, and other such social venues,” the Prime Minister said, adding that the state would “no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do” — but declining to ban them. Despite the advice to “stop unnecessary travel” the borders do remain open, also — although in practice many of the countries most likely to be vectors for new cases have largely shut down outgoing flights.

"President Donald Trump hit New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Twitter Tuesday for criticizing his handling of the coronavirus crisis. “Andrew, keep politics out of it…” Trump wrote on Twitter. The New York Governor continues to criticize Trump publicly for failing to level nationwide orders restricting American behavior and close bars and restaurants. Trump reminded Cuomo all states had different levels of the coronavirus. “Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,” Trump wrote. “New York is a very big ‘hotspot,’ West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases,” he said. Speaking on his brother Chris Cuomo’s show on CNN, the New York governor presented himself as a truth-teller to the president, leading the nation in the fight against the epidemic. “You have to know how to mobilize the federal government,” Cuomo said. “You have to know how to manage the government.” Cuomo also faulted the president for failing to order the Army Corps of Engineers to construct temporary hospitals. During his press conference on Monday, Trump said Cuomo should be doing more to fight the virus. “I think he can do more,” he said, repeating a message he wrote on Twitter hours earlier. “And, you know, it’s an area of the country that’s very hot right now.” Cuomo wants “all states to be treated the same.” But all states aren’t the same.

"TEL AVIV –  An Israeli man returned a 2,000-year-old catapult bolt to the Israel Antiquities Authority some 15 years after he took off with it while visiting the archaeological site of the Jerusalem Walls National Park in the City of David, saying he wanted to clear his conscience before the end of the world. “The time has come to clear my conscience. It feels that the end of the world is near,” the remorseful man said, according to an Israel Antiquities Authority press release on Monday. The anonymous man didn’t return the artifact, also known as a ballista stone, directly but used a go-between, Moshe Manies, who agreed to keep his identity a secret.  Ballista stones from the City of David Clara Amit, Israel Antiquities Authority The original theft occurred when two rebellious youths touring City of David site close to the Old City of Jerusalem came across the ballistae, which had been catapulted at fortifications, Manies said. “One of the boys took one of the stones home. Meanwhile, he married and raised a family, and told me that for the past 15 years the stone has been weighing heavily on his heart,” Manies wrote in a Facebook post. “And now, when he came across it while cleaning for Passover, together with the apocalyptic feeling that the coronavirus has generated, he felt it was time to clear his conscience, and he asked me to help him return it to the Israel Antiquities Authority,” Manies added. Ballistae are a form of ancient weapons used in the besiege of cities. The stone would be mounted on the ballistae and catapulted onto forces standing on fortress walls, the IAA’s release said.  Courtesy: Uzi Rotstein, Israel Antiquities Authority “The ballista stones which were uncovered at the City of David are most likely connected to the harsh battles between the besieged residents of Jerusalem and the soldiers of the Roman Legion, from around 70 CE – the year of the destruction of Jerusalem,” the IAA’s Jerusalem Region Archaeologist Dr. Yuval Baruch said. “Additional stones of this type have been unearthed in Jerusalem, in, among other places, the area of the Russian Compound near the estimated path of the Third Wall, which was the external wall of Jerusalem during the time of the Second Temple. In the excavations of the Israel Antiquities Authority there, a battlefield was uncovered, with tens of ballista stones scattered on the ground,” Baruch added.

(Shalom Kveller, courtesy of the City of David Archives) A commenter on Manies Facebook post tagged Uzi Rotstein, an inspector in the IAA’s Theft Prevention Unit, who then arranged for a rendezvous for the return to take place. “Disconnecting an artifact from its archaeological framework by its removal negatively impacts the research and the ability to piece together its historical puzzle. We commend the return of the artifact and appeal to anyone who has taken an archaeological artifact, to take a weight off their heart and return it to the State Treasury,” he said. “These artifacts, which are thousands of years old, are our national treasure. They tell the story of The Land and of who resided here before us, and should be documented and displayed,” said Rotstein.  ","Fearing End of World, Thief Returns 2,000-Year-Old Artifact After 15 Years",2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/03/17/fearing-end-of-world-thief-returns-2000-year-old-artifact-after-15-years/,Breitbart

"TEL AVIV – An Arab-Israeli woman posing as a humanitarian worker was arrested for siphoning off aid money to the Hamas terror group, the Shin Bet security agency said Sunday. Aya Khatib, 31, funneled money and provided intelligence for the Gaza-based terror group’s military arm, the security agency said. She was apprehended last month for rerouting hundreds of thousands of shekels earmarked for needy families in Gaza, “defrauding both aid NGOs and innocent civilians who donated monies with the goal of reaching sick people and the needy,” the agency said in a statement. Some of the money went towards terror activity, including the construction of subterranean tunnels stretching into Israeli territory. In addition to raising funds, Khatib is also suspected of gathering security intelligence to promote terrorist activity against Israeli targets. “The investigation findings found that Khatib also provided intelligence to Hamas, including details on the movements of IDF forces during one of the rounds of conflict with the Gaza Strip,” the Shin Bet said. A prosecutor’s statement was filed in Acre Magistrate’s Court on Sunday and an indictment is expected to be filed at Haifa District Court in the coming days. Khatib is being charged with aiding an enemy during wartime, having contact with a foreign agent, and financial transgressions relating to terror activities. Khatib’s husband, Ali Aqel, who was arrested with her, was released the same day after a brief investigation.Dozens of Arab Israelis have protested her arrest outside the Haifa Magistrate’s Court a number of times in recent weeks.

"The U.S. airline industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak and will ask the federal government for a $50 billion aid package, according to Airlines for America (AFA), an airline advocacy organization. “U.S. carriers are in need of immediate assistance as the current economic environment is simply not sustainable,” an AFA statement said. “This is compounded by the fact that the crisis does not appear to have an end in sight.” CNN reported on the move that reverses an earlier stance the air travel industry could weather the storm — before the full impact of the virus outbreak came to light: The requested aid would be in the form of loans, grants and tax relief. The airlines are looking for up to $25 billion in grants for passenger air carriers and $4 billion in grants to cargo carriers, and the same amounts in loans or loan guarantees, Airlines for America outlined in a briefing document. The U.S. aid package has been discussed with key lawmakers and staff, as on Capitol Hill and the Trump administration, two sources said. The discussions were described as early-stage. But one source noted there is a growing recognition from the federal government that conditions “are getting very bad, very fast.” In addition the request to help the airlines, a trade group for the nation’s airports is requesting a separate $10 billion bailout, an airport industry source told CNN. The request also is in line with expected revenue drops at airports because most of the fees airlines pay are based on flight volume. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing is quoted in the CNN report that it is in discussions with the feds and the airline industry. “We’re leveraging all our resources to sustain our operations,” Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, said. “Meanwhile, ready short term access to public and private liquidity will be one of the most important ways for airlines, airports, suppliers and manufacturers to bridge to recovery, and we appreciate how the Administration and Congress are engaging with all elements of the aviation industry during this difficult time.” America’s major airlines would run out of money as soon as June 30 without financial assistance, AFA reported. President Donald Trump said at a coronavirus press conference on Monday at the White House his administration is behind helping the industry. “We’re going to back the airlines 100 percent,” Trump said. “We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much.” “We’ve told the airlines we’re going to help them,” Trump said. “It’s very important.” “There are about 460,000 jobs in the US airline industry, according to the Labor Department, and most of them provide good pay and strong benefits,” CNN reported. “The industry is crucial for the efficient functioning of the U.S. economy, not only enabling business travel but also leisure travel, which itself is a major sector of the U.S. economy. Commercial aviation taxes and fees totaled $26 billion in 2019, or an estimated $71 million per day, AFA reported. CNN reported that the last bailout for U.S. airlines was $15 billion bailout – $5 billion in cash and $10 billion in loan guarantees — following the 9/11 terror attack.

However, there were no match updates — for good reason: the game had been postponed to allow authorities to take precautions against a coronavirus outbreak.

Ahmed Hussein, the Communications manager of the Football body confirmed the development on Sunday evening. “We shall now have the tournament on March 24-28,” added Hussein. He added that they have had to push the tournament by a week because of the current challenges of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and also to give the other teams time to prepare. The Tri-Nations tournament to be played at the Ugandan National Stadium will attract hosts Uganda, Mali and Zambia. The three teams will use the tournament to prepare for the 2020 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) slated for April 4-25 in Cameroon.

Because, you know, at the beginning of this administration, when we had a lot of leaders, like, well, your father, Robert Gates, others, all said we only have one president at a time. We have to do everything we can do to make sure this president succeeds. Well, obviously, this president has made that very difficult over the past three years.

"Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) called for Congress to pass additional targeted relief to families in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak during an appearance Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” Hawley argued the best vehicle for distributing this relief would be through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), given that the agency has a method to disburse income tax reimbursements. “[T]he IRS is set up to disburse reimbursements for income taxes, for instance, so there is a mechanism there in place for the IRS,” he said. “You know, one of the advantages, I suppose, of having to pay our taxes as we do every year is that the IRS does know how to contact Americans quickly. So I think we should use the IRS disbursement process.” Hawley continued, “As to the amount, the IRS estimates that a family of four — a middle-income family of four spends about $1,800 a month on basic expenses. That’s not amenities but just basic expenses. So the idea would be to cover some increment of that to try to give working families some relief.” The Missouri Republican also argued dor the Centers for Disease Control to take more of an advisory role for the states. “I’d like to see the CDC — Centers for Disease Control — issue some uniform guidance. I don’t know that the federal government has the authority to order governors,” he added. “I mean, they can strongly encourage. You know, this is just our system of federalism, right? They can strongly encourage governors and mayors to take certain steps. But I do think it would be helpful for the Centers for Disease Control to issue uniform guidance and to say listen, here is our strong recommendation across the board.

"President Donald Trump described the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” on Twitter on Tuesday, triggering his critics. The president used the term while addressing critical comments from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. “Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,” Trump wrote. “New York is a very big ‘hotspot,’ West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.” Despite the virus originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, the president’s critics have angrily accused him of being racist for using the term “Chinese virus.” Trump also referred to the “Chinese virus” on Monday night, vowing to keep the airlines from going under as a result of dramatically reduced travel. “The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,” he wrote. “We will be stronger than ever before!” Chinese Communist Party propaganda has disparaged the term as “racist” and “reckless.” “We call on the U.S. to stop finger-pointing at China. The utmost priority is for the international community to cooperate on fighting the virus,” party spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday. “The U.S. should focus on its top priority, and play a constructive role in international cooperation on health security.” The president also shared a comment on Twitter from conservative radio host Mark Levin, criticizing The Atlantic and other American media for spewing “China’s propaganda” about the virus.

Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts. If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus. And we’re going to have a big celebration all together. The president also announced promising news in the development of a vaccine against coronavirus: With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly. A lot of progress has been made. I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history. Not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments. And we’ve had some promising results — early results, but promising — to reduce the severity and the duration of the synd- — of the symptoms. As the nation hunkers down for the next several weeks — or months — without extensive contact with one another, the prospect of a celebration may become more enticing over time. Last summer, President Trump held a celebration called “A Salute to America” on the National Mall on July 4. In it, he celebrated many of the nation’s heroes in past fights, from World War II to the civil rights struggle and beyond. Joel B.

"Ten cases of the Chinese coronavirus were confirmed Tuesday by the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) among recently arrived “refugees and asylum seekers” in Germany. Acccording to a report by the Reuters newsagency, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a press briefing about the newly diagnosed cases who had entered the country through Europe’s remaining open borders. “As of this morning, we understand there are 10 confirmed cases in Germany,” Mahecic said. “These are people who are either refugees or asylum seekers,” he added. The cases are in Munich, Berlin and Heidelberg. All national authorities have been urged by the agency to treat refugees and asylum seekers who fall sick with the virus the same way as other nationals. German police face demonstrators holding up pictures of refugees as they demonstrate against Europe’s migration policy and the handling of refugees at the Greek border on March 9, 2020 opposite the venue of a German-Hellenic Economic Forum in Berlin. ( JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images) The news of the fresh cases in Germany comes barely 24-hours after Germany closed its borders with five neighbouring countries in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus, as Breitbart News reported. At 8 am on Monday, Germany shuttered borders with Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, France and Denmark, allowing only commuters and delivery trucks to enter the country. The move reverses the policy of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had said as recently as last week the borders would remain open. Last week, Merkel also warned by the end of the outbreak in Germany, between sixty and seventy per cent of the country could become infected with the coronavirus, however, at the time refused to close down the borders.",10 Coronavirus Cases Confirmed by U.N.

"Actor George Takei has asked his 2.9 million followers on Twitter to report President Donald Trump to the platform’s authorities for “stoking racism” after the president correctly referred to the coronavirus pandemic as originating in China. Takei, who is one of Hollywood’s many anti-Trump fanatics, made the plea after Trump referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” when making a pledge to protect industries suffering the severe economic consequences of its spread. “The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!” The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 16, 2020  “Do me a favor and report this tweet. Trump is stoking racism,” responded Takei. “[Jack Dorsey] may not do anything, but people should let Twitter know it’s not acceptable.” Do me a favor and report this tweet. Trump is stoking racism. @jack may not do anything, but people should let @Twitter know it’s not acceptable. https://t.co/ongaXpn4od — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) March 17, 2020  As noted by Breitbart, the terms “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus” were recently declared racist by those on the progressive left, despite the fact that journalists for CNN and even some Asian media had been using the same phrases for weeks. Over the years, many novel diseases and viruses have taken on the name of the place they originated. For example. the Ebola virus was named after a river in the Congo close to where an outbreak began, Lyme disease was after a Connecticut town experienced an outbreak in 1975, and the Zika virus was named after a forest in Uganda where scientists discovered it. Takei, however, has long sought to promote the idea that he is himself a victim of racism as an Asian American. In 2016, he even went so far as to write to the Academy Awards to complain about a joke from Chris Rock that Asian children aspired to be accountants and an insinuation by actor Sacha Baron Cohen that Asian men were not well-endowed.

"Devout Muslim Shiite followers in Iran fought their way into two major shrines closed over coronavirus fears, Iranian state media reported Tuesday, as they demanded the right to continue worshipping practices that include kissing, touching and in some cases licking sacred public objects. As the Islamic Republic pressed on with its struggle to control the Mideast’s worst Chinese coronavirus outbreak, angry crowds stormed into the courtyards of Mashhad’s Imam Reza shrine and Qom’s Fatima Masumeh shrine. The faithful typically pray there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, touching and kissing the shrine. That’s worried health officials, who for weeks ordered Iran’s Shiite clergy to shutter them. Earlier on Monday, the state TV had announced the shrines’ closure, sparking the mass protests. “We are here to say that Tehran is damn wrong to do that!” one Shiite cleric shouted at the shrine in Mashhad, according to online video. Others joined him in chanting: “The health minister is damn wrong to do that, the president is damn wrong to do that!” As Breitbart News reported, strict Muslim religious observance has clashed before with state control in Iran. Earlier this month online videos emerged showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they have no fear of infection during the country’s escalating coronavirus outbreak. <span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> Touching and kissing surfaces in shrines is a common practice for Muslim pilgrims, and religious hardliners argue the holy sites of Qom are “a place for healing” that the government has no right to close down. Iran’s shrines draw Shiites from all over the Mideast for pilgrimages, likely contributing to the spread of the virus across the region. Saudi Arabia earlier closed off Islam’s holiest sites over fear of the virus spreading. President Hassan Rouhani said despite the closures, “our soul is closer to the saints more than at any time.” Iran warned Monday the coronavirus pandemic could overwhelm local health facilities as the death toll topped 700 and another senior lawmaker died from the disease, as Breitbart News reported.

"The world must look to China, pay attention and follow its principles in order to halt the global spread of the coronavirus, the official Communist China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday. Despite the fact coronavirus was first discovered last year in the city of Wuhan, where officials tried for six weeks to conceal the deadly outbreak, China is increasingly trying to recast itself as a global leader on the treatment of the pandemic. To that end it is issuing guidance and instruction for other countries to follow, with the full support of the United Nations and World Health Organization functionaries, although not everyone is buying the propaganda push: Sen. @MarcoRubio is standing up against the communist Chinese regime.  https://t.co/RtvEKRW9CA — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 17, 2020  The China Daily editorial said Singapore, Japan and South Korea had all “based their responses on the experience and lessons drawn from China’s successful battle with the virus”, and China was now “proactively sharing” its best practices. At the same time the Communist regime is disappointed not all countries are paying attention, increasing the possibility that the epidemic will get worse, the newspaper said: Despite the unmistakable seriousness of the situation, some countries have tried to play down the risks, and the measures they have taken are not only insufficient to control the pandemic at home, but also not enough to prevent themselves from being the source of virus transmission to other countries. Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday attempts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to curb the Wuhan virus would not succeed, and could lead to retaliation. His appeal drew a sharp response from Pompeo who conveyed “strong objections” to Yang over what the State Department described as “PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” as Breitbart News reported. Over the past few weeks, Chinese officials and state-managed social media accounts began floating theories that the coronavirus began in the United States and was brought to Wuhan by U.S. Army soldiers visiting for the Military World Games in October. Thursday’s allegations from the Chinese Foreign Ministry that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in America and was spread to China by the U.S. military was not a fluke or an example of a rogue spokesman running his mouth. https://t.co/1Jt5KSCYpo — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 14, 2020  On Monday a major Chinese Communist Party paper, the Global Times, stated again – without evidence – the virus might have been developed in the U.S. Army laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, before being secretly released to harm an innocent and entirely helpless mainland Chinese populace.",China Commands World to Follow Its ‘Success’ on Wuhan Coronavirus It Hid for Months,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/03/17/china-commands-world-to-pay-attention-follow-its-lead-in-coronavirus-fight/,Breitbart
"President Donald Trump wants an $850 billion economic package to help combat the economic effects of the coronavirus, according to reports. The package, according to reports, will ask for dramatic tax cuts and industry rescue funding for companies like the airline industry to pull them through the crisis. Congress already passed an $8 billion package of funding to help fight the virus, which Trump signed, and the House of Representatives has passed a second package of economic relief that includes funding for food and nutrition, paid sick leave, and free coronavirus testing. The Republican-led Senate has called for a much bigger economic package as the stock market collapsed by 12.93 percent on Monday. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has already begun negotiating a much bigger plan with Senate Republicans.

"MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski praised President Donald Trump Tuesday for his tone during a White House press conference regarding the coronavirus pandemic. Brzezinski followed up her husband and co-host Joe Scarborough’s call to help Trump succeed by saying the President’s serious tone the day before “made it easier to parent teens” when it comes to battling the coronavirus. “[W]hat you saw yesterday was the president getting better when it came to matching his tone and his own kind of gut response to questions that he was getting to the reality of the situation,” Brzezinski told Scarborough. “And whether or not you have a jaundiced eye, you noticed that, and you sat up and took note. I mean, the President of the United States made it easier to parent teens yesterday. Because if you don’t have groups of 10 or more, and the President is saying you can’t do that, it’s much easier to communicate that to the young population. He did a lot to get people to take it seriously yesterday. I mean, I’ve seen where we are right now, and where we go during the day or communities that might be more pro-Trump, that might think this is hoaxy. Nope, everyone is in. Everyone, immediately, you could feel a difference after the news conference yesterday.” She continued, “So I don’t know if the jaundiced eye on both sides applies to right now because people are really scared. They’re seeing the signs. They’re seeing the maps. They’re seeing this spread across the world. And what they want to see from Washington is a mass mobilization, a war footing. And the President’s beginning to show that.” Brzezinski added she hopes Trump takes his Twitter behavior “down a notch.” “I’m really hoping he takes it down a notch on anything that’s sort of vintage Trump, going after people, fighting the fight,” she stated. “At this point, it is uniform what we need — uniform mobilization.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",Brzezinski: Trump Coronavirus Press Conference ‘Made It Easier to Parent Teens’,2020-03-17,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/03/17/brzezinski-trump-coronavirus-press-conferencemade-it-easier-to-parent-teens/,Breitbart
"Gordon Chang, Daily Beast columnist and author of The Great U.S.-China Tech War, noted the parallel narratives between America’s left-wing news media and China’s state-run propaganda regarding the coronavirus outbreak. He also praised President Donald Trump’s travel ban measures in response to the viral spread, offering his analysis on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow recalled news media derision of Trump’s identification of the coronavirus’s origin in China as “racist.” Assorted news media figures and Democrat disparaged the sharing of such information as “xenophobic.” “When did it become improper to describe a virus based off of where its origin is?” asked Marlow, reflecting on the Ebola virus being alternatively referred to as West Nile virus. “But yet, all of a sudden the president’s a racist here. It just seems like the media always does this.” “They also suggested the travel ban from Europe was racist — even though the President’s also a Nazi, depending on who you ask, and he banned travel from Germany,” joked Marlow, “but it’s hard to keep up. [Do] you take any of it seriously … or is it just all sort of their usual talking points? ” Chang replied, “I take this very seriously, because what China is trying to do [is] say that we’re responsible for the coronavirus, and that has enormous implications — not only between China the United States, but around the world — because it does affect our image.” Chang added, “China is trying to divide the U.S. by slinging these charges of racism, and so therefore they’re trying to undermine the Trump administration and the president himself.” LISTEN:
 China echoed left-wing news media in its coronavirus-related propaganda in disparaging Americans as socially pathologized by “xenophobia” and “white supremacist racism.” The one-party state also suggested the coronavirus is a biological weapon deployed by the U.S. military. Trump’s imposition of travel restrictions to limit the risk of coronavirus-infected persons entering the homeland was prudent, assessed Chang. “I’m also frustrated about something else,” said Chang, “the media, of course, is always critical. That’s just its natural bent, but we’ve got to remember that the reason why our country is not completely crippled right now is because on January 31st, President Trump, taking heat from domestic critics and from Beijing, imposed the travel bans on the quarantines in China.” Chang continued, “That actually saved us… bought us a lot of time… and also these travel bans on our allies are absolutely necessary. The one on Europe is only the most recent, but we’ve got to remember that this has stopped the flow of new infections into the United States. We’ve got trouble enough with the you know, human-to-human infections inside our country.” Chang concluded, “We don’t need people bringing more infection [or] more disease into the United States, and President Trump has taken an enormous amount of heat for that, but that’s absolutely been the right thing. I’m frustrated that we don’t see more defense of the president across media, and not just the liberal media, but this needs to be emphasized that this was really a very good thing.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

"Matt Mowers, a former Donald Trump official and New Hampshire First Congressional District Republican candidate, on Tuesday called for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to extend the tax deadline in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Mowers called for the IRS to extend the tax deadline from April 15 to July 15. Mowers also called on his opponent, Rep. Chris Pappas (D-NH), to support the tax deadline extension. The New Hampshire conservative wrote in a letter to Pappas, “During these challenging times, it is important for us all to pull together as Granite Staters and as Americans.” Mowers continued: I am writing to you because I have heard from many Granite Staters, particularly small business owners in New Hampshire, who are being hit particularly hard economically right now. They are concerned that they will not be able to make ends meet to pay their rent or their employees.” As public leaders we need to do all that we can do to make life easier for them during this period of uncertainty. To alleviate their burden, I ask that you support action to move the filing date for taxes from April 15 to July 15, so no one is unnecessarily  burdened financially during this time. While our workers and small business owners need relief now, I believe Uncle Sam can wait to get his due. “This type of common-sense idea is just one of many that will be needed in the days ahead – when we hope our elected officials can come together from both parties to put the well-being of our state and our nation first,” Mowers concluded.

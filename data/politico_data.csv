"In the weeks since the coronavirus outbreak first reached the United States, @realDonaldTrump has launched a barrage of more than 50 tweets on the growing pandemic, initially offering a rosy assessment of the growing health crisis—assuring Americans that it will “all work out well,” that the outbreak was spreading “very slowly in the U.S.” and that it’s “very much under control”—even as the death toll rose and the number of cases ballooned. In recent days, Trump has taken a more serious tone about the crisis, advocating for policy responses and travel bans, but even the news conference announcing his national emergency declaration ended with a jaunty exclamation point. That’s Trump himself. But what about his Twitterverse? The president follows only 47 accounts on Twitter, a collection of family members, conservative pundits, administration officials and Trump-brand properties.  Even as health experts and mainstream reporters have grown increasingly anxious about the White House’s response to the coronavirus pandemic—and have taken to using their own Twitter accounts to share hand-washing videos and urgent warnings from doctors overseas—when Trump opens his own Twitter feed, he scrolls through something very different. The picture Trump sees, in a nutshell: That the coronavirus crisis is someone else’s fault (China, Joe Biden, etc.), that he’s doing a great job responding to it, and that a Trump-hating media is just fanning the flames.  “The American people have seen once again that President @realDonaldTrump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people,” tweeted Vice President Mike Pence. “Remember Democrats Pushed Impeachment While Coronavirus Spread,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday morning, with a link to a Breitbart column.  “@realDonaldTrump will use every tool available to protect the American worker as he safeguards the health of all,” tweeted Ivanka Trump on Tuesday.  As Trump faces the biggest public health crisis of his presidency, a reading of dozens of tweets from the president’s favorite Twitter users over the past week shows his allies shaping Trump’s feed into five main coronavirus narratives: While Trump has come under increased pressure to respond more forcefully to the outbreak, his allies have taken to Twitter to frame the coronavirus as a foreign threat that spiraled out of control because of a bungled international response.  “Remember, China initially REFUSED to allow the CDC into Wuhan,” conservative activist and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec said in a post retweeted into the president’s feed by his son Donald Jr.  “Inside China's high-stakes campaign to smear the United States over coronavirus,” read the headline of a Fox News article in the president’s feed.  “POTUS was right to restrict travel from China in January, and now there is more evidence that @realDonaldTrump made the right call restricting travel from Europe, too,” tweeted Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee.  “President Trump must take China on here—they created this health crisis, now they’re claiming America is to blame. Typical communist ploy. #Wuhancoronavirus,” tweeted Fox News personality Laura Ingraham.  The president’s allies were also quick to dogpile on 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who was vice president during the 2009 H1N1/swine flu pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic. Even so, former President Barack Obama has remained relatively unscathed by attacks in the Trump Twitterverse, which remains focused on Biden.  “When Biden was vice president, swine flu infected 61 million Americans and killed 12,000,” Ryan Saavedra, a reporter with the conservative online outlet the Daily Wire, wrote in a post retweeted into Trump’s feed. A few hours later, Trump himself took a swipe at Biden, blaming the former vice president for the deaths of thousands of people during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  “President @realDonaldTrump acted early and decisively... His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears,” tweeted Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, quoting the campaign's communications director.  “When @JoeBiden was faced with a public health crisis on H1N1, he pushed the panic button and the White House had to cover it,” read a message retweeted by Donald Jr.  Other tweets in the president’s news feed framed recent comments from Biden opposing xenophobia as opposition to Trump’s temporary ban on travel from China.  “If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would have contracted the virus faster,” a Trump campaign account tweeted. And in response to a Biden speech in which the former vice president criticized the president for labeling COVID-19 a “foreign virus,” Laura Ingraham tweeted: “Yeah, Joe! Let’s throw open our borders, our airports, our ports to anyone and everyone—that will really stem the infection rate!” Critique of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is largely absent from his Twitter feed. Instead, his allies have heaped praise on the administration’s response.  “Deeply impressive extraordinary partnership of America’s best and brightest business & government gathered at White House under leadership of @realDonaldTrump & @VP,” tweeted Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera after Friday’s national emergency declaration. “They and we are going to kick #Corona’s ass.” “This is a very good call,” conservative political commentator Eric Bolling tweeted on Friday in response to reports that Trump was planning to declare a national emergency.  “This is the leadership @realDonaldTrump was elected to provide,” tweeted Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, after the president’s Oval Office address on Wednesday night. “Acting early & decisively he put the U.S. on much better footing than other nations in handling the coronavirus.” “President Trump is exactly right: ‘smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,’” tweeted Congressman Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican close to the White House. “The President’s actions are proactive and decisive. This is exactly what we need to keep Americans safe and healthy.”  And a tweet from Eric Trump shared simply the headline of an adulatory New York Post column: “Trump passes coronavirus test with flying colors.”  The president’s eldest son, Donald Jr., has led the Trump Twitterverse’s charge against the mainstream press’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In his posts and retweets, he’s accused news outlets of stoking panic and helping China spread propaganda. “That the US media is trying to run with the Chinese propaganda that ‘China bought us time’ is a new low even for them,” Donald Jr. tweeted in response to a New York Times op-ed. “F-you!” “The media has thrown everything at [Trump] and none of it has stuck,” said YouTube personality Dave Rubin in a tweet shared by Donald Jr. “So now they have a vested interest in spreading panic, rejoicing over market drops and sewing general chaos.” “This Chinese propaganda about the origin of the coronavirus is being directly amplified and aided by the U.S. media, which is censoring anyone who notes the Wuhan origin of the coronavirus,” said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist and conspiracy theorist, in a post retweeted by Donald Jr.  “CNN is literally taking its talking points from the Chinese government,” read another Cernovich tweet shared by the president’s son. Other accounts followed by the president sounded a similar tone. “Erring on the side of maximum transparency is a good thing for the White House given the mass hysteria being stoked by the partisans in media and politics with [the] goal of affecting the election,” tweeted Laura Ingraham.  “I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using [coronavirus] as a tool to politicize things and to scare people,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet shared by McDaniel. “It's not responsible. This is not the time for this.” During a March 4 phone call with Sean Hannity, Trump falsely implied the coronavirus outbreak was not as bad as the seasonal flu—an idea he may have picked up from his Twitter followers, who have downplayed the virus’ threat. “They say the mortality rate for Coronavirus is higher than the flu,” tweeted Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. “Consider though that we have a flu vaccine and yet in 2019, 16,000 Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have that vaccine. The flu would be a pandemic.”  “The word ‘pandemic’ is scary, but as @drsanjaygupta points out, it doesn’t speak to mortality rates, only to global scope of infection,” Ingraham tweeted in late February. “As @CDCgov notes, actual mortality rates or coronavirus is very low.” On Friday morning, Ingraham tweeted a link to an article headlined: “Coronavirus: Facts vs. Panic,” which stated “most people who get coronavirus have mild or no symptoms” and “most around the world diagnosed from January-March 1 have already recovered.”  “Great time to fly if not in at-risk population!” Ingraham wrote Friday from the aisle seat of a Chicago-bound United flight.",What Trump’s Twitter Feed Tells Him About the Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-twitter-feed-covid-19-129170,politico
"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Trump’s monumental challenge: Rescuing industries in free fall,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show fealty to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says ‘well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made healthcare an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain, said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico

"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac, the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by the three largest credit reporting agencies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. Fair Isaac and VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico
"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development will leave the job at the end of this month, two people familiar with the move confirmed Friday, marking a high-level departure from one of the agencies tasked with responding to the global coronavirus outbreak.  Former GOP Rep. Mark Green is expected to submit his resignation to President Donald Trump early next week, according to a senior administration official, who said USAID Deputy Administrator Bonnie Glick, a Trump loyalist and former State Department foreign service officer, will take Green’s place as acting head.  Green already informed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, with whom he has worked closely on women’s global development programs, of his decision to step down.  “His plans have been in place for awhile, but he began telling folks last week,” said a person familiar with Green’s departure.  The outgoing USAID chief, who has been with the agency since Aug. 2017, is expected to be named president of the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Green previously served as president of the International Republican Institute, an organization once chaired by the late Arizona Sen. John McCain. The D.C.-based think tank lost its executive director Kurt Volker, who served as Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, amid the fallout from the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry last fall after he stepped down following his appearance as a witness in the probe.  “I believe the recent media focus on my work as U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute,” said Volker, who was involved in the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Ukraine. The McCain Institute could not be reached for comment.  Green’s exit from the agency, which has been at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to divert Middle East aid to religious minorities in the region, comes weeks after he announced a $37 million commitment to 25 countries that have been affected by COVID-19, which reached pandemic levels this week and has topped 1,000 confirmed cases inside the United States.  Earlier Friday, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up to $50 billion to fight the rapidly spreading virus by boosting containment efforts and the availability of test kits.

"Suspended schedules. Darkened stages. Empty arenas. As the worsening spread of the coronavirus has forced shot callers in sports, entertainment and politics to nix games, parades, conventions, campaign pit stops and gatherings of almost every sort and size, Donald Trump over these past few dizzying days essentially and begrudgingly has made the same decision—even if he hasn’t made an official announcement. After holding more than 300 rallies during the 2016 campaign and nearly 100 more since he was elected—after going last month to Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada and South Carolina to “troll” Democrats in the runups to the primaries—the president was not in Michigan, Missouri or Mississippi this past week, and he won’t be in Ohio or Illinois or Florida or Arizona ahead of Tuesday’s votes. He has canceled events in Las Vegas, Denver and Milwaukee. And for the first time in a long, long time, Trump has on his typically merry-go-round docket of rallies … nothing. All of a sudden, we live in a world without crowds. And for Trump, it’s an existential threat—as much a threat as a sinking economy or the virus itself. Because Trump doesn’t just love crowds. He needs them. He needs crowds because of their political utility. Needs them to mine “data gold.” Needs them to be rolling, roiling, visceral focus groups—listening to the ebbs and flows of their roars, serving them what they want, scrapping what they don’t, stoking support with a skilled evangelist’s call and response. He is, after all, at his best and most effective riffing to the rank and file as opposed to monotonously reciting from a teleprompter all alone in the solemnity of the Oval Office. And he needs crowds, too, and perhaps most importantly, on account of psychological necessity. “They are his lifeline,” Bandy Lee, a Yale University psychiatrist and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, told me this week. “He’s very good at this,” she said, referring to the catalog of his performances at his rallies, “because his life depends on it, not just the life of his presidency but the life of his psyche.” In the estimation of Lee and other experts of her ilk, as well as the many people who have known him and worked with him for years, the way Trump is ties back to the way he was raised. The “complete emptiness inside,” the “bottomless void” that “can never be filled,” the “psychological defects” and “pathologically narcissistic traits”—all of this, says Lee, is a result of the core particulars of Trump’s upbringing: his distant and demanding father, the disruptive near-death experience of his mother when he was just a toddler, his banishment to military school when he was barely a teenager. “The lack of love translates into desiring accolades,” Lee explained. “And the rallies are really the most critical crutches that he’s had. He needs his followers more than his followers need him.” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair calls “a live audience” his “oxygen machine.” “The crowds,” former Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell told me the other day, “get him through the night.” And it’s always been like this. Starting in the 1970s and ‘80s, the foundationally lonely Trump cultivated transactional relationships with reporters and gossip columnists, in the same manner as his mentor, Roy Cohn. At times, he used a fake name to do his own PR. He decorated the walls of his office with magazine covers bearing images of his own face. In Atlantic City, at his casinos, he jaunted across gaming floors, feasting on the clamor of the throngs. “They cheered him,” recalled Alan Marcus, a former Trump publicist. “In front of a big crowd, and a big crowd could’ve been 25 people or 25,000 people, he can shine. Because he’s got that Trump persona. The Trump persona takes over the room.” By the middle of the aughts, when the success of “The Apprentice” erased the stain of his personal failures and business busts of the ’90s, he obsessed about the reality show’s ratings. “Ratings,” said Marcus, “are crowds.” And Trump’s political ascent? Implausible to the point of impossible without crowds. In the couple years before 2015, on the precampaign campaign trail, at off-year cattle calls of would-be candidates, Trump tested out talking points. “He would put forth his position or his feelings, and he would judge the level of response,” the late political strategist Pat Caddell once told me. He monitored not internal polling but Twitter mentions and tallies of retweets. He gauged what sizzled on conservative talk radio so he could channel it back. At his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower, when he glided down the escalator to say that he was running, the crowd was so important he paid some people to be there. The next month, he drew approximately 4,000 people to a rally in Phoenix. A month after that, the crowd was roughly five times that size in Mobile, Alabama, where he had his plane circle the stadium to a standing ovation and the wild-eyed appeal of his candidacy became hard to ignore. “Trump’s campaign,” Roger Stone would write, “was centered around a ‘set piece rally.’” At one of them, in New Hampshire, he told the people he had lots of friends, and rich friends, but who no longer would be his friends if and when he got elected. “You know who my friends are?” he said. “You’re my friends.” The crowd. Their cheers. And ever since, all the way up to his last rally, in Charlotte, on the second night of this month, Trump has engaged in an almost hypnotic version of the same, over and over again, using every one of his signature events to draw red-capped crowds, and to talk about the size of the crowds—whether or not, of course, the specifics are true—seldom missing a chance to employ the crowds and their counts as an ongoing contrast to cudgel his Democratic opponents. “An integral, main part of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman has said. “The driving force,” according to the campaign’s COO. But as America shuts down, as Broadway goes dark and Disney World goes dormant and March Madness goes poof, Trump at the moment has been stripped of arguably his most potent political strength. Entering a new, utterly altered reality, mere weeks after he traveled to India to revel in the adoration of a crowd of 110,000, Trump sat in the White House at a desk called Resolute and appeared out of his element and underprepared—while Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in the general election, stood the next afternoon in front of a bank of American flags in a hotel in Delaware and spoke to mostly just clicking cameras and seemed not frail or poorly supported but serious and up to the task. Biden’s (small) crowds and Trump’s (large) crowds hardly matter because now there are no crowds at all. “Rallies are important to the Trump campaign, and I’d worry about losing them,” former Trump aide Michael Caputo said, “because it would tilt a bit to Biden’s advantage.” Another former Trump aide pushed back on the premise. “It’s very early in the presidential cycle,” Sam Nunberg told me. “He’s still going to be able to hold rallies eventually, calling the guy ‘Sleepy Joe’ and making fun of him … one way or the other.” Nunberg stressed that Trump still has television and Twitter, platforms on which he has an irrefutable record of mastery of a certain sort, and that his flush campaign is a Facebook juggernaut, too, and that he always has possessed a blithe capacity for surviving crises and skirting consequence. All valid points. He made a prediction. “Trump will end up doing rallies,” Nunberg said. “Pandemic or not, Trump will end up doing rallies.” “What are your plans, Mr. President,” a reporter asked him on Thursday, “about campaign rallies?” “I think the Democrats won’t be having rallies, but nobody shows up to their rallies, anyway,” Trump said. “So, what difference does it make?” “But what about you, sir?” “My rallies are very big,” he said. “On the rallies, we’ll make that decision,” he continued. “But at this moment, we don’t have …” He stopped himself—as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to say it out loud. “I was going to Las Vegas. … I was going to Colorado …” He fantasized about a rally in Tampa on March 25 that reportedly was being planned but had not been publicly announced. That didn’t prevent him from dropping highly dubious details. “All sold out,” Trump said. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do.” No more rallies. No more crowds. “It’s like, if Don Rickles performed to a room of three people, would he have been funny? You know, insult comics, they need the energy of the discomfort they create for the jokes to work, for the act to work,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me this week. “It’s very bad for Trump to not have crowds. And I think he knows it.”",What Is Trump Without His Crowds?,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-crowds-129048,politico
"OTTAWA — Over five extraordinary hours on Friday, Canada’s federal government suspended Parliament, delayed its federal budget, imposed new restrictions on international travel and promised a major fiscal stimulus package, while the Bank of Canada slashed interest rates as the country collectively braces for the impact of coronavirus. The announcements rolled out, one after another, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained in isolation at his home in Ottawa, dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic that has turned personal — his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday, though her symptoms are mild. Trudeau has no symptoms of the virus, which has so far infected 157 people in Canada and caused one death. Speaking from outside his home at Rideau Cottage, Trudeau assured Canadians the government will take any measures necessary to slow the spread of the disease and to cushion them against its economic impacts. “We do not want any Canadians to have to worry about whether or not they’re going to be able to pay their rent,” he said. “We need to make sure that Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best public health advice and keep themselves safe.” Friday’s announcements mark a dramatic escalation in the government’s response since the World Health Organization labeled the coronavirus a pandemic two days ago, and a stark change in tone — on Thursday evening, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was still saying the budget would be tabled on March 30, as planned. But on Friday morning at 10 a.m., all five of Canada’s major political parties agreed to a motion to adjourn the House of Commons until April 20, in response to the spread of Covid-19. The suspension could be extended if necessary. Parliament has also passed spending-related bills that will allow the government to keep cash flowing while the House of Commons and Senate aren’t sitting. “We will face this together, and we will get through this together,” Government House Leader Pablo Rodríguez told reporters. The parties have agreed to a process to allow Parliament to be recalled over the coming weeks, if needed, with a skeleton crew of members present — likely those who live within driving distance. Before Parliament shut down, MPs and senators rushed to pass the USMCA, which received royal assent on Friday afternoon, making Canada the last country to endorse the new North American free trade pact. A few procedural steps remain before Canada formally ratifies the deal, and it will be several more months before it goes into force. President Donald Trump said Friday that Trudeau told him during a phone call the day before that Canada was on the cusp of approving the trade deal. The all-party motion on Friday also delayed the federal budget, previously scheduled for March 30. Morneau did not say when the budget might now be introduced, or whether that could happen before April 20. The budget, however, has suddenly become an afterthought as Morneau turns his attention to the far more urgent task of keeping the economy afloat. In an exceptional act of coordination Friday, Morneau held a rare joint press conference with Stephen Poloz, governor of the politically independent Bank of Canada, to introduce emergency measures in an attempt to buttress the economy before it suffers significant damage. Poloz made the biggest splash by introducing an unscheduled interest rate cut of half a percentage point — his second 50-basis-point reduction in nine days — to cushion the economy from the effects of coronavirus and battered crude prices. The governor left the door open to do more, if necessary. Morneau also provided a boost of C$10 billion in available credit for businesses through two business development agencies. Jeremy Rudin, the superintendent of financial institutions, joined them to announce changes that will effectively add more than C$300 billion in lending capacity for major banks. Morneau promised that more help is on the way. Ottawa will unveil a ""significant"" fiscal stimulus package next week, he said, including direct support for individuals. The new measures will come on top of a C$1 billion support package the government unveiled on Wednesday, which included money for provincial health care systems. The finance minister said another volley of economic support could come out of a phone call scheduled for Monday between Trudeau and his fellow G-7 leaders. He added the G-7 is looking for a coordinated approach. Ottawa is also taking new steps to limit the spread of Covid-19 to Canada from beyond its borders. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said international flights arriving in Canada will be restricted to a smaller number of airports to allow for screening of all passengers. The list of airports has not yet been released. Garneau also said all cruise ships carrying more than 500 people, including crew, will not be allowed to dock in Canada before July 1. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Canadians should postpone or cancel international travel, and should practice social distancing, including by avoiding crowded places, waving or touching elbows instead of shaking hands and staying two meters away from other people. She warned that anyone who travels internationally will be subject to any new rules suddenly imposed in those countries. “Your one-week trip may become much longer,” she said. However, as of yet there seems to be little discussion of any possible closures along the Canada-U.S. border. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said conversations with U.S. counterparts on Thursday highlighted “how important that border is for both of our countries,” while Trump told reporters the border had not come up during his conversation with Trudeau. “I think what we have to remember is that viruses don't know borders,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu said. “A border is not going to contain the virus.” The new measures come less than 24 hours after Trudeau’s wife tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a trip to the U.K. and exhibiting mild, flu-like symptoms. Grégoire Trudeau is currently in quarantine, and the prime minister and their three children will remain in isolation for 14 days. Trudeau has no symptoms and therefore has not been tested for the virus. Other parliamentarians, including International Trade Minister Mary Ng and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, are also in self-isolation after experiencing symptoms, though they have not been diagnosed with the virus. Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan had also shown symptoms, but tested negative for coronavirus on Friday. The federal government’s new approach to the coronavirus comes in the wake of tighter restrictions imposed by a number of provinces during the past 48 hours. All four of Canada’s largest provinces have now recommended canceling events with more than 250 people or have banned them outright, and Quebec and Ontario have both closed schools for at least two weeks. Trudeau spoke with provincial and territorial premiers on Friday afternoon, but at least one premier has already made clear he believes Ottawa isn’t doing enough. In a news conference before the call, Quebec Premier François Legault called on Trudeau to ""rapidly limit the entry of visitors to Canada."" On Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the announcements came in a rush, landing in a city that has only seen a few cases of the virus so far, and where there’s a sense that the storm must be coming but somehow isn’t quite real. Just before noon, ministers and public health officials clustered together on a stage in the National Press Theatre, telling Canadians to stand two meters apart and not to gather in large groups. A large group of journalists faced them, sitting side-by-side, passing around a couple of microphones that got a quick wipe-down between each question. And then, a few hours later, everything was quiet on the Hill, except for the strange vestiges of business-as-usual that hadn’t yet ground to a halt. At 3 p.m., two small groups of tourists were being led through the galleries overlooking the empty House of Commons, one numbering just three people. They were among the last visitors to be allowed in, before the building closes to the public. Two floors below, the House of Commons cafeteria was shutting down for the day and staff were getting ready to leave. They didn’t know when they’d be back.

"President Donald Trump on Friday deflected blame for his administration’s lagging ability to test Americans for the coronavirus outbreak, insisting instead — without offering evidence — that fault lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama. “I don't take responsibility at all,” Trump said defiantly, pointing to an unspecified “set of circumstances” and “rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.”  The remarks from the president came in response to questions at a Friday press conference about the lack of widespread access to testing, an aspect of his administration's coronavirus response that has been the subject of widespread, steady criticism. Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea is testing each day.  And Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that “the system is not really geared to what we need right now” in and called the testing system “a failing.”  But Trump, who spent weeks downplaying coronavirus before declaring it a national emergency on Friday, argued that the health care system was not designed for an outbreak on the scale of coronavirus, “with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.”  The president kept his criticism lighter and more forward-looking at first, declaring that his administration is “leaving a very indelible print in the future in case something like this happens again.”  “That's not the fault of anybody — and frankly the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers but not for these kind of numbers,” he added. But then Fauci stepped up to the mic to clarify his position, arguing that the CDC’s testing system, “for what it was designed for, it worked very well,” and maintaining that an “embrace” of the private sector was necessary for testing at the kind of scale needed for the fast-spreading coronavirus.  Then, Trump began pointing fingers.  “If you go back — please, if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. they didn't do testing like this,” he interjected, referencing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that sickened more than 60 million people between April 2009 and 2010. Trump asserted that the Obama administration “didn’t do testing” and that when “they started thinking about testing,” it was “far too late.” He reiterated a claim made on Twitter earlier in the day, calling the Obama administration’s response to the swine flu outbreak “a very big failure,” though the H1N1's fatality rate of .02 percent is much lower than the lowest fatality estimates for the coronavirus thus far.  Trump later got testy with another reporter who pressed him on whether he bore any responsibility for the surge in cases, noting that he’d disbanded the White House’s pandemic office. Trump told the reporter, PBS NewsHour's Yamiche Alcindor — with whom he's butted heads with in the past — that her inquiry was a “nasty question.”  After noting that his administration had quickly acted to restrict travel from China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, the president said he personally was not responsible for dissolving the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which had been part of the National Security Council until his administration disbanded it and rolled its officials into another office. “And when you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people. I could ask — perhaps in my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.” Trump said. “You say we did that. I don't know anything about it.” He continued: “I don't know, CDC, perhaps they do that — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.” Trump then began to move on, before returning to defend his administration’s response.  “We are doing a great job,” he insisted, referencing the health officials and business executives gathered behind him. “Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great incredible doctors and business people — the best in the world — and I can say that whether it's retailers or labs or anything you want to say. These are the best in the world.”  He also pointed to the number of fatalities in the U.S. attributed to the virus, which has hit 40 in the several weeks since the first reported case in the U.S., and is significantly lower than other countries hit hardest by the disease.  “Compare that with other countries that are many, many times that amount,” Trump said. “One of the reasons we have 40 and others have and, again, that number is going up just so you understand.” Trump’s criticism of the Obama administration on Friday wasn’t limited to its response to its own pandemic. At another point in the press conference, Trump appeared to work in a shot at healthcare.gov, the website created by the Obama administration for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges that was infamously marred by connectivity issues almost instantly when it debuted. Announcing that Google had offered to assist the White House in the creation of a website to better help Americans determine whether they needed to be tested for coronavirus and where to get tested if so, Trump quipped that the tech “is helping to develop a website that will be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.”",'I don't take responsibility at all': Trump deflects blame for coronavirus testing fumble ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-coronavirus-testing-128971,politico

"President Donald Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus aims to jump-start a lagging federal response by expanding testing, giving hospitals more capacity to deal with a potential flood of new patients and expanding telehealth, so patients in hot spots can be treated virtually. It reflected a growing acknowledgment of the scope of the public health crisis, with Trump himself saying at a Rose Garden rollout of the plan that he will ""most likely"" get tested, without committing to share the results. At the same time, Trump rejected blame for any shortcomings in a testing system that critics say has contributed to community spread of the respiratory disease, saying “I don’t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” The various policy moves left many questions unanswered, among them whether a website Trump said Google is developing to screen and test patients could compromise their privacy. Here are some key features: The president said the administration is working with pharmacies and other retailers to make drive-thru testing available ""at critical locations."" And he announced a series of partnerships with private labs to boost testing capacity just one day after top federal infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told House lawmakers that the federal government’s current testing system had been a “failing.” The president said there would be another 1.4 million tests available by next week and 5 million within the months, adding, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.” Public health experts would disagree: Multiple tests are often used on one person, and while federal officials have been hesitant to project case numbers, Fauci himself warned lawmakers that a complacent mitigation response could boost case numbers to the “many, many millions.” Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that 11,000 Americans had been tested. The FDA approved the first high-volume coronavirus test today. The president also appeared to oversell an effort by an affiliate of Google to help develop a website that will aid the administration’s efforts to screen and test for people with the virus. Trump suggested a sweeping effort, saying Google had 1,700 engineers working on the project and had made ""tremendous progress"" — and that the site will be able ""to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. ... We have many, many locations.""  But Verily, the life-sciences arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, later said in a statement that the website is in ""the early stages of development"" and would be initially tested in the Bay Area, ""with the hope of expanding more broadly over time."" Vice President Mike Pence said the administration by Sunday evening will ""be able to give specific guidance"" on when the website will be available.  The announcement instantly raised red flags for patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Trump outlined emergency measures hospitals can take under the declaration, most of which would free up beds for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. “Critical access” hospitals that are limited to 25 beds and get higher Medicare rates can boost their capacity and extend patient stays now limited to 96 hours. The order lifts rules for where hospitals can treat patients within their facilities and lets them add doctors as needed. The hospital industry supports these steps and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to release more detailed guidance later Friday that could expand on Trump’s list. The declaration lets HHS Secretary Alex Azar waive certain laws to expand the use of telehealth, which public health experts say can help reduce risk of transmission. The new order appears to let Azar waive federal licensing requirements so out-of-state doctors can treat patients virtually in states with the greatest need. The $8.3 billion coronavirus emergency funding package Trump signed last week also allows Azar to waive restrictions on Medicare payment for telehealth, as Congress has typically done for past emergencies. Telehealth groups and lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the committee overseeing Medicare, have encouraged Azar to activate that authority. Trump in his Rose Garden remarks called telehealth a “fairly new and incredible thing,"" though health care providers have used the technology for over a decade.

"Even as he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, President Donald Trump couldn't help but shake hands. “I want to encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we have issued by CDC and these common sense measures,” Trump told reporters at a Rose Garden press conference with top health officials and healthcare, retail and pharmacy CEOs. “A lot of it is common sense.”  The CDC’s website says to “avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places — elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people.” But as Trump introduced CEOs and members of his coronavirus taskforce, he couldn’t resist extending his hand.  First, he grabbed the mic and adjusted it for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.  He later reached out to Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, who looked down at the president’s hand before grabbing it to shake.  Trump shook hands with three others before Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president of the LHC Group, put a stop to the hand shaking. Greenstein instead offered an elbow bump to the president.  “I like that,” Trump said, after elbow-bumping. “That’s good.”  Trump, who indicated Friday that he had not been tested but ""most likely"" would be, has been exposed to people with the illness. While Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has disputed a media report that he initially tested positive for the virus less than a week after meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his press secretary, who took photos with Trump, tested positive for coronavirus this week.  Aside from his meeting with Bolsonaro in Florida, Trump has also been exposed to multiple Republican lawmakers who have self-quarantined after their own exposure to someone who tested positive for coronavirus at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump said he had not experienced any symptoms of the disease, but was consulting with his doctors on whether, and when, to get tested.  ""I think I will do it anyway,"" the president said, though he did not commit to sharing the results of a possible test. ""We are working out a schedule.""",Trump can't resist handshakes as he declares a coronavirus national emergency,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-cant-resist-handshakes-as-he-declares-a-coronavirus-national-emergency-128950,politico
"The full bench of the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to weigh in on two legal fights critical to President Donald Trump: whether the House can use the courts to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, and whether the House can sue to block Trump's effort to fund border wall construction over Congressional objections. The Friday afternoon announcement wiped out a major victory Trump scored last month when a smaller panel of the same court ruled, 2-1, that the courts should not wade into subpoena fights between Congress and the White House. The appeals court said it will hear arguments, en banc, April 28 in both the McGahn and border wall disputes. There seems to be little chance that the Supreme Court will resolve the issues definitively before the November election, but rulings in the House's favor could lead the justices to intervene with a stay in the coming months. Prospects for Trump prevailing in the cases at the D.C. Circuit look grim. While the active bench of that court leans toward Democratic appointees by a 7-4 margin, the order Friday indicated that both of Trump's nominees--Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao--have recused themselves from both cases.  As a result, the en banc court for McGahn will have only two Republican appointees. One additional GOP appointee, Judge David Sentelle, will join the en banc court considering the border wall funding dispute, the order said. The renewed debate at the D.C. Circuit over critical separation-of-powers issues is set to play out about a month after the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a trio of cases involving demands for access to Trump's personal financial records.  Two of those cases involve subpoenas from House committees. The third was triggered by a subpoena that a local grand jury in New York City issued for Trump's tax and business records. A decision from the Supreme Court in those cases is expected by the end of June. The majority opinion the D.C. Circuit issued last month in the McGahn case said the courts should butt out of subpoena fights between Congress and the executive branch because intervening would effectively shut down the usual process of negotiation between the branches and instead send both sides running to court.  Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also said blessing the subpoena was likely to trigger endless eddies of litigation over individual questions lawmakers wanted to ask McGahn in connection with their investigation into alleged efforts by Trump to obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. However, House lawyers pleaded with the full D.C. Circuit to rehear the case, arguing that bowing out of such fights actually amounts to siding with the White House, since it typically has considerable leverage over testimony and records lawmakers want. House Counsel Douglas Letter also warned that trying to foreclose subpoena litigation could lead to more unpleasant conflicts, like efforts by the House to arrest uncooperative witnesses. The Justice Department contended that McGahn, as a close presidential adviser, was absolutely immune from subpoena. Griffith didn't endorse that position. Judge Karen Henderson, who was on the panel and will be the only other GOP appointee on the en banc court, rejected the absolute immunity argument, but concurred with Griffith that courts shouldn't referee such fights. The only dissenter last month was Judge Judith Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. She said the court was gutting the House's impeachment powers by refusing to enforce the subpoena. The other appeal stems from the House's unsuccessful effort to challenge the plan Trump' announced in 2019 to use over $6 billion from military construction and counterdrug budgets to fund border wall construction even though Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for barrier projects and put strict limits on that money. The move, backed in part by a presidential emergency declaration, spurred a flurry of lawsuits from environmental and human rights groups, states, border residents, and the House itself. All said Trump's actions violated the power of the purse granted to Congress by the Constitution. The House's lawsuit, filed in Washington, found no traction. Last June, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden tossed it out, finding that Congress had no standing to sue Trump administration officials over allegedly unauthorized spending.  The House appealed that ruling, setting in motion arguments that took place before a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel last month and now scheduled to be reprised before the larger, 10-judge court in April.  No decision was rendered by the three-judge panel before Friday's order taking the border wall case en banc. The order said the issue of the House's standing is ""common"" to that case and the dispute over McGahn's testimony. Other suits aimed at blocking Trump's unusual border wall funding plan found greater purchase in the federal courts. Groups suing in California managed to get an injunction against construction, as did by El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights in a suit brought in Texas. However, those victories proved to be short lived, as the Supreme Court blocked the injunction out of California and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the one in Texas. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.","Full appeals court to hear McGahn, border wall cases",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/appeals-court-don-mcgahn-border-wall-cases-128914,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders acknowledged Friday that the novel coronavirus public health crisis had ""radically"" altered the nature of his White House bid ahead a slate of crucial primaries. The remarks from the Vermont senator came after a roughly 15-minute speech he delivered from his hometown of Burlington, where he discussed the “lessons” Americans could learn from the coronavirus and argued that its rapid spread demonstrated the need for his “Medicare for All” policy proposal. But following his brief address, Sanders was pressed by reporters on what the brutal political realities of the pandemic meant for his campaign. “That’s why I’m here today,” he said with a wink and a smile, before turning somber. “You’re right, it has significantly impacted our campaign, as all of you know,” Sanders said, describing his “love” for the massive rallies and more intimate town hall meetings his campaign has begun canceling in the wake of the burgeoning outbreak.  “That is changing, as you’ve indicated correctly,” he said. “Our staff is now, by and large, working at home. So it has radically changed our campaign.”  Leading up to the next four nominating contests Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, Sanders indicated that he would be relying increasingly on the various digital resources of his campaign apparatus in his primary battle against former Vice President Joe Biden.  “What I think we have going for us — which we have always had going for us, but we’re going to have to utilize even more — is our internet capabilities,” Sanders said. He cited his “many, many, many millions” of followers on Twitter and other online platforms, as well as his campaign’s ability to livestream events like his speech Thursday.  “We are in the process of thinking this through,” he added. “But this coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. And that’s hurting.” Sanders was also asked about his goals moving forward in the primary campaign, and whether the worsening coronavirus threat had forced him to rethink his role in the race given the calls he has already faced from some senior Democrats to concede the nomination to Biden. “Well my long-term goal is to win. The short-term goal is to figure out how we deal with the issues that you guys are appropriately raising,” Sanders replied, conceding that “under normal circumstances, I would not be in Burlington today.”  “I would be probably in Ohio, Florida or another state where a primary is coming up. But we can’t do — we’ve decided not to do under the advice of public health officials, not to do rallies, and that’s the right decision,” he continued. “So we are figuring out a way as to how we can best communicate with people, which will certainly be in a very strong way utilizing our social media capabilities.”",Sanders: Coronavirus has 'radically changed our campaign',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-campaign-coronavirus-128767,politico
"Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both acknowledged discussing potential aid from Washington to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, amid a crisis in air travel unlike anything the industry has seen since Sept. 11, 2001. Delta also announced it is cutting 40 percent of its flight capacity, the steepest in its history. The news comes two days after President Donald Trump announced a monthlong halt to U.S.-bound passengers from most of Europe, a stoppage that in one blow decimated many of the industry’s most lucrative international routes. “We are in discussions with the White House and Congress regarding the support they can provide to help us through this period,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees obtained by POLITICO. ""I’m optimistic we will receive their support."" A spokesperson for American Airlines also said Friday that the carrier was involved in early discussions with the government. Airlines have been struggling financially for weeks because of a steep slump in passenger demand as the global pandemic has spread. But Trump’s European travel restrictions pushed them even further into crisis. (Trump said Friday that he may expand the restrictions to include people coming from the United Kingdom.) ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we’ve seen,"" Bastian wrote, noting that bookings are net negative— meaning canceled bookings are more than new bookings — at Delta. ""We’re currently seeing more cancellations than new bookings over the next month,"" added. On Thursday, an administration official told POLITICO that ""Congress really will have little choice to act or face a significant extinction moment for the airline industry."" Trump's economic aides have been studying how the President George W. Bush administration propped up the airline industry after 9/11. Bastian warned in his memo, though, that the ""form and value"" of help from the government is unpredictable. ""We can’t put our company’s future at risk waiting on aid from our government.""

"President Donald Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump stayed home from work at the White House on Friday as a precaution after meeting with an Australian official who has coronavirus.  “The White House is aware that [Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton] tested positive for COVID-19. He was asymptomatic during the interaction,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. ""Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine. She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.” Last week Ivanka, Attorney General William Barr and Trump aides including Kellyanne Conway met with Dutton in Washington for a meeting about online child exploitation. In a statement released on Friday on Twitter, Dutton said he “woke up with a temperature and sore throat” and confirmed he has the coronavirus.  “I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for COVID-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive,” Dutton said in a statement.  In a photo posted on Twitter by the Australian Embassy in the U.S., Dutton is seen standing next to Ivanka and the other officials. Barr also stayed at home on Friday, according to Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec, who said he is “feeling great and not showing any symptoms” and has consulted with the CDC. “CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point,” Kupec said.  Ivanka and Barr are the latest people close to the president who have potentially been exposed to the virus and have stayed home as a precaution. Republicans close to the president -- Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Matt Getz of Florida, Rep. Doug Collins of Florida, and incoming Chief of Staff Mark Meadows – all self-quarantined after being exposed to a person with the virus at CPAC.   Trump was in contact last weekend with at least two people who have now tested positive for COVID-19 after a meeting with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro at his home and sanctuary in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago. One of Bolsonaro’s aides, communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, and the Mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, were both at Mar-a-Lago and said they have the virus, although they are reportedly doing well.   Despite the close encounters, the White House has not signaled that the president has been tested for the virus, which has now infected over 1,000 people in the United States and has spread to almost every corner of the world.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the lead experts on Trump’s coronavirus task force, said on MSNBC Friday that “yes,” someone who has been exposed to a person with the virus should isolate themselves and find a test, but would not speak directly about the president’s situation.  “You know, I leave that to the president’s physician,” Fauci said. “They have very good White House physician and physician staff there, so when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician.”",Ivanka Trump stayed home from White House after exposure to person with coronavirus ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/ivanka-trump-coronavirus-exposure-128721,politico
"At 73 years old, President Donald Trump is a prime target for a contagious disease that falls hard on the elderly. Multiple people in the Trump orbit are infected. Trump posed for a picture alongside an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who has tested positive. (Bolsonaro, who is in the same picture, denies reports that he’s positive.) The president spoke at the CPAC conference earlier this month where, as was later reported, an attendee carrying a gold-plated VIP ticket was later diagnosed as virus-positive. Other attendees of the conference, including incoming chief of staff Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), and Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) exercised medical caution with self-quarantine. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.),who was at Mar-a-Lago at the same time as the Brazilian visitors, is also self-quarantining. And both Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump recently spent time with an Australian minister who subsequently tested positive. It’s almost as if the virus has circled Trump. At this point, it’s not morbid, just good planning, to say the administration has no excuse not to start making plans for the chance that the virus might incapacitate Trump. The White House has not exactly been transparent about whether Trump has been tested. But his age and his clinical obesity mean that his system would be fighting an infection from a trench: It can put older patients on ventilators, sometimes for four weeks, even if they do recover. The Constitution has a provision for this, of course: The 25th Amendment allows an orderly transfer of power if the president can’t execute his duties. The obstacle to such a smooth transition isn’t the system: It’s Trump. Trump himself never admits weakness. As a businessman and a leader, he resists looking too far ahead, and is known for simply dodging and weaving to keep bad news at bay—a quality that has already served him badly in handling the biggest crisis of his presidency. As for the people around him: He hand-picks his staff for personal loyalty over any particular principles, and replaces them when they fail to exhibit the blind allegiance he desires. The 25th Amendment has been invoked only a few times, always voluntarily by presidents themselves when they’ve undergone surgery. If it’s hard to imagine Trump himself ceding power for any reason, it’s even harder to imagine the amendment’s powerful Section 4 being invoked, transferring power from the president without his consent. It requires consensus of the people close to him—specifically, “the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide.” The idea that Pence and the Trump Cabinet would automatically step in and unseat their boss should Trump contract the virus—and, say, be hospitalized without handing over the reins—cannot be assumed. Even if they did get together and agree to hand Pence control, it is Trump, and no one else, who has groomed and cultivated the political base that would likely flip out and scream “coup” the moment it happened. The 25th Amendment has already come up in Trump’s presidency. It received heavy review and inspection in the early semesters of Donald Trump’s term when top White House aides fretted that the chief executive might have only one oar in the water. Trump’s erratic, impulsive, unstable ways—his firing of FBI Director James B. Comey; his divulging of classified information to Russian diplomats in the Oval Office; his request for “loyalty” from Comey, in particular—reportedly prompted discussions about using the 1967 amendment to replace him with Vice President Mike Pence. But just because Trump, Pence and the Cabinet might not do the right thing doesn’t mean we shouldn’t secure a promise from them that an orderly transition of power is being sketched out should serious illness strike the president. To prevent a destabilizing vacancy in the most powerful office in the world, Trump must volunteer that he will use the 25th Amendment to turn over the powers of the presidency to Pence if he becomes seriously ill. Under the amendment, he can retrieve these powers by simply writing a letter expressing that he has regained sufficient health to serve as president. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used the amendment to temporarily delegate presidential powers during medical incidents during their terms. Trump must also encourage Pence to exercise a transition of power should he become gravely ill.  Invoking the 25th Amendment is nowhere near staging a coup, as Trump ultraloyalists might holler.

"President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to offset lagging coronavirus testing and unlock billions of dollars — accelerating a response plan that has faced weeks of criticism. Trump touted partnerships with private companies that he claimed would allow patients to learn if they need to be tested and locate a testing site, some of which will be drive-thru facilities at big box retailers across the country. “To unleash the full power of the federal government under this effort today, I'm officially declaring a national emergency,” he said at an announcement in the Rose Garden. “Two very big words.” Trump insisted the move would eradicate the testing shortcomings that health experts say hindered the country’s ability to contain the virus when it first appeared on American shores. In recent days, Trump’s health officials have warned Americans to expect the situation to worsen, spurring much of the country’s public spaces to shutter — professional sports have been suspended, concert halls are closed until further notice and many Americans have been asked to self-isolate. Yet even as Trump unleashed $50 billion in government funding, the announcement had a distinct market-first flavor. Trump outlined a series of agreements with private companies, including Google, Target and Walmart, to facilitate swifter coronavirus testing for Americans. Target and Walmart said they will set aside parking lot space for testing sites, while Google pledged to set up a website to determine whether a person needs a test, and where one is available. “Very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites,” said Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump put in charge of the administration’s coronavirus task force. Trump said he expected 1.4 million additional tests to be available next week and 5 million within a month — even as he cautioned against everyone rushing to get tested. “We don’t want everybody taking this test,” he said. “It’s totally unnecessary.” Trump has faced condemnation over the administration's failure to provide adequate testing and resources for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people worldwide and infected tens of thousands. Health specialists have also reprimanded Trump for repeatedly downplaying what has now been deemed a global pandemic. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said of the government’s struggles to produce enough tests, blaming existing rules set by prior administration for limiting his options. “We were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” And he claimed to not know that a pandemic preparedness team within the National Security Council was scrapped in 2018. Trump called a question about it “nasty” at a news conference.  “I didn’t do it,” he said. Still, Trump's executive actions on Friday received a positive response on Wall Street and even among Democrats. A faltering stock market swiftly rebounded as Trump was speaking, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring nearly 2,000 points, or more than 9 percent, the largest percentage gain since the 2008 crisis. The comeback reversed nearly all of Thursday’s tumble, which was the worst since the 1987 market crash. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y,), who had urged Trump to act more forcefully, offered rare praise for the president but warned him not to go too far. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” he said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) offered no comment. In addition to his executive actions, Trump has pressed Congress for an economic stimulus package that could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. Late Friday, Pelosi announced that she had clinched a deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a package meant to provide paid leave for workers, expand food aid and support widespread testing for the illness at no cost to patients. Only hours earlier, Trump had said during his press conference that he did not yet support the latest version of the bill.  “We just don't think they're giving enough,” he said. “We don't think the Democrats are giving enough.” Friday's national emergency declaration was considerably different than one the White House earlier this week had signaled was being prepared. A White House aide involved in the coronavirus response told POLITICO on Wednesday that Trump would sign a limited emergency declaration that only addressed the faltering economy by unleashing billions of dollars for loans to small businesses and to cover missed paychecks for hourly workers. But Democrats and many health care industry leaders were pressuring Trump to declare a more expansive emergency to help hard-hit states build mobile hospitals and shelters, while assisting with public safety and other issues.  White House documents referenced both the Stafford Act, which is designed to activate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Emergencies Act, the same law he invoked last year to repurpose government funds for construction of a southern border. But the president only said his order would increase the powers of the Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency thus far in the administration's coronavirus response. Under Friday's order, HHS will be able to waive certain Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program requirements in an effort to bypass time-consuming regulations. Separately, Trump said the federal government will waive interest on federal student loans and would purchase additional crude oil for the nation’s reserves. “This will pass,” he said. “This will pass through. We're going to be even stronger for it. We learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned.” Previously, Trump had been reluctant to declare a more sweeping national emergency, fearful of stoking panic with such a dramatic step. But his thinking evolved as the American coronavirus caseload soared past 1,600 this week, with public health officials warning the country to expect a spike in the coming days. For weeks, Trump has tried to reassure Americans that the widening outbreak is under control. But the situation has escalated in recent days. The stock market has dropped in record numbers not seen since the 2008 recession, and much of the country — from Disney World to professional sports leagues, museums and concert halls — has shut down. Across the U.S., the coronavirus has now killed more than 40 people and health officials have warned that the situation will worsen. Trump made another attempt to calm Wall Street during a brief prime-time Oval Office address on Wednesday. But he instead caused more confusion when he misrepresented the contours of a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from Europe and misstated that insurance companies had promised to fully pay for people’s coronavirus treatment. Friday's declaration builds on a previous, agency-specific ""public health emergency"" declaration HHS made in January. The move unlocked some initial federal money and resources. But Friday’s two designations are much broader. Still, some disaster management experts were disappointed that Trump on Friday did not appear to task FEMA — the agency that oversees hurricane, tornado and flood response — with leading the government’s coronavirus response plan. “FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis,” said Tim Manning, a former FEMA deputy administrator. “If there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved. I’m not sure how it could be done mechanically or legally without FEMA.” FEMA has previously helped with government responses to other insidious dangerous outbreaks, including SARS, MERS and Ebola. While previous presidents have made emergency declarations “virus threat” disasters — Bill Clinton did it for West Nile virus under the Stafford Act — it is rare, former FEMA officials say.",Trump declares national emergency in latest bid to combat coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/coronavirus-emergency-declaration-trump-128530,politico
"Asia’s richest man announced his intention on Friday to ship 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.  Jack Ma’s charitable foundation and his China-based company's foundation, the Alibaba Foundation, have also sourced and donated supplies to other countries being hit by the virus, including Japan, Korea, Italy, Iran and Spain.  The donation comes amid testing delays across the U.S. as state officials scramble amid a shortage of lab materials — sparking concerns that health officials are undercounting the number of Americans with the virus.  “Drawing from my own country’s experience, speedy and accurate testing and adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus,” the statement said. “We hope that our donation can help Americans fight against the pandemic!” Ma’s announcement also comes as Trump aides and allies cast blame on China, with some officials calling it “the Wuhan virus” — a reference to the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the disease. National security adviser Robert O’Brien has accused China of covering up a health crisis, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has labeled the outbreak the “Wuhan coronavirus.”  “The crisis presents a huge challenge to all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we face today can no longer be resolved by any individual country,” Ma said in the statement. “Rather, we need to combat the virus by working hand-in-hand. At this moment, we can’t beat this virus unless we eliminate boundaries to resources and share our know-how and hard-earned lessons.”","Chinese businessman to donate 500,000 test kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. ",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/jack-ma-coronavirus-test-kits-128522,politico
"Louisiana will postpone its presidential primary, which was originally scheduled for April 4, as part of the state government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The state is the first in the nation to postpone a primary since the outbreak of the virus. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the contest will be delayed until June 20.  “Safe and secure elections also mean safety to the people of Louisiana,” Ardoin said at a press conference. Several states are voting before Louisiana, including four holding primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. But officials in those states indicated that Election Day will go on as planned. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from Arizona Secretary of State Kathy Hobbs, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, Illinois Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose read. The Wyoming Democratic Party, which is holding its caucuses on April 4, also canceled the in-person portion of their upcoming vote. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Louisiana moving its primary could cause a major headache for the state for the Democratic National Convention. As written, the national party’s delegate selection rules mandate that states hold their nominating contests by June or face delegate penalties. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9th. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" State election officials around the country have been scrambling to make adjustments ahead of their primaries, including moving polling places away from locations concentrated with high-risk individuals, like nursing homes. The top election official in Arizona's Maricopa County, where just under 60 percent of the state's registered Democrats live, announced that his office would mail ballots to ""traditional Election Day voters"" eligible to vote in Tuesday's Democratic primary but who do not normally get absentee ballots mailed to them. Voters are encouraged to not mail the ballots back. Instead, officials say mailing out ballots before Election Day will allow voters to drop off already filled-out ballots in an effort to limit interactions and promote social distancing. Ohio, which is holding its primary on Tuesday, is moving nearly 150 polling places. Similar measures have been taken by some municipalities in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, which will also vote that day. “We’re seeing that this public health moment presents challenges for elections officials,” Kristen Clarke, the president & executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said. “And its having a cascading effect … By next week, on Tuesday, we’ll see coronavirus having an even broader impact on how elections are playing out.” Aaron M. Sellers, a spokesperson for the Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio, said he started receiving panicked calls over the weekend from directors of elder care facilities.  “They want to limit residents’ exposure to visitors because that’s such a vulnerable population,” he said in an interview with POLITICO.  The Centers for Disease Control recently issued guidance targeted to election officials that urges states and counties to encourage mail-in voting and early voting as much as possible, in an effort to “minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling stations.” The CDC also urged poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect polling stations, “limit nonessential visitors” and encourage as much social distancing as possible. Election administrators and party officials in most states have also been pushing voters to take advantage of early and mail voting, when possible. However, laws regulating voting in any other way other than in person, on Election Day, vary wildly by state. “Staffing [flexibility], more utilization of mail ballots, being concerned about infection, providing disinfectant, all of these things are ideas that supervisors of elections are trying to implement,” Ion Sancho, a former longtime supervisor of elections in Leon County, Fla., said. “And at the last second, this is not going to be simple. This is not going to be easy. But we're going to get through it.” But the last-minute changes present significant challenges as well. In Ohio, Sellers said his county was not able to find replacement polling sites on such short notice, and will instead consolidate with neighboring precincts.  “It’s incredibly difficult to find good locations that are ADA-compliant and have ample parking on such short notice, plus they have to want us to be there,” he said.  Election administrators are also grappling with another coronavirus-related challenge: a dependence on elderly poll workers. “We’re getting people calling us who are apprehensive, saying, ‘Hey I just don’t feel comfortable working the polls,’” Sellers said. “So we’re finding additional people to chip in.”",Louisiana postpones primary as states scramble to adjust to coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/louisiana-postpones-presidential-primary-due-to-coronavirus-128514,politico
"The leader of a libertarian-leaning tech group is stepping down as its president after tweeting that it would be “poetic justice” if President Donald Trump died from the coronavirus, the group confirmed Friday. Berin Szóka, president of Washington-based think tank TechFreedom, will be taking an indefinite sabbatical to write a book on tech policy, as first reported by POLITICO earlier Friday. Shane Tews, a longtime member of the group's board, will lead the organization in his stead.  The move deals a blow to one of the tech industry’s staunchest defenders in Washington, where Szóka has served as its combative and outspoken leader for nearly a decade. Szóka and TechFreedom, which receives funding from at least one tech giant, Google, have been relentless allies of Silicon Valley, particularly as it has faced calls for increased regulation in Washington in recent years. The group has opposed efforts to create more stringent rules for privacy and online speech, among other issues. But Szóka has also been a frequent critic of the president, delivering at times scathing rebukes of his actions on social media. The planned shake-up comes just four days after Szóka prompted a firestorm of criticism online by suggesting that the president succumbing to the virus would be fitting. “Serious question: could there possibly [sic] any greater poetic justice in the universe than for Trump to die of the #CPACvirus?” Szóka tweeted late Monday. Recent reports that an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference was later diagnosed with Covid-19 sparked fears that the president may have been exposed to the virus. Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had contact with the president as well before entering self-quarantine due to possible exposure. The Szóka tweet immediately drew condemnations online, racking up hundreds of negative replies within minutes and some calls for his resignation. Szóka later deleted the tweet, and has since issued an apology. “Earlier this week, I sent a thoughtless tweet making an inappropriate comment about the President that I deeply regret,” he tweeted Thursday. “I was wrong to tweet it and deleted it. Again, I apologize.”",Tech think tank chief to step down after Trump death tweet,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/think-tank-chief-to-step-down-after-trump-death-tweet-128397,politico
"In the early hours of Friday, U.S. and British aircraft conducted multiple airstrikes on the missile storage sites of the Iraqi militia group Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian group that was also hit by unclaimed airstrikes in Syria the day before. Until Wednesday, when a rocket attack killed two Americans and one British service member on a sprawling base north of Baghdad, there hadn’t been much noise from Tehran since its reprisal in early January after the U.S. killed Qassem Soleimani. This week’s attack, which was meticulously planned and clearly not the work of the ramshackle remnants of the Islamic State, changed that. A truck with two rows of rocket-launching tubes discreetly installed in the flatbed, approached the base undetected and fired the rockets in one sudden salvo.  As someone who has gotten lost while walking around the maze of concrete barriers that make up the 15-square-mile Camp Taji base, I can attest to the great accuracy of the strike. Taji is massive, and the strike hit at just the right moment and just the right spot, probably guided by a drone or human agent.  The next day, Kataib Hezbollah (KH), the Iraqi Shiite militia closest to Iran, praised the attack as an act of the pro-Iranian “resistance” against U.S. “occupation”, a surefire sign that pro-Iranian militias were behind the strike and the Shiite militia version of “humble bragging.” By that stage, either U.S. or Israeli aircraft had already struck back at KH and other Shiite militias, albeit just over the border in Syria late on Wednesday, killing around two dozen fighters and wounding many more. The strikes, and the subsequent round launched very early Friday morning, were reminiscent of the United States’ retaliatory attacks in late December on KH after the militia group caused the last U.S. death in Iraq in a rocket attack on December 27.  Friday morning’s strikes may not be the end in a new tit-for-tat cycle that has the potential to spark a wider conflict. Iran is escalating through its Iraqi militias because it wants to raise pressure to evict U.S. forces from Iraq and to threaten Iraqi leaders ahead of next week’s selection of a replacement for resigned Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Thursday: “You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” But how can deterrence be established quickly to end the cycle of attacks and prevent further loss of American lives? The deaths of two U.S. personnel—one military, one contractor—at Taji comes days after the March 8 deaths of two U.S. Marine special forces operators in a firefight with the Islamic State in northern Iraq. The two episodes underline the complexity of what the U.S. military is attempting to do in today’s Iraq. The mission of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR, or the coalition, for short) is still to defeat the last remnants of the Islamic State. In recent weeks, the coalition has ramped up its special forces raiding alongside Iraqi commandos, achieving significant successes against Islamic State leadership targets. When the U.S. gets on a roll, triggering new raids on the basis of data from laptops and phones recovered in each prior raid, terrorists face the most unrelenting foe in the world. But boosted effectiveness comes at a cost of added risk, as the March 8 deaths illustrate. To complicate matters, Iran-backed militias like KH are seeking to lever the U.S.-backed coalition out of Iraq by any means necessary, regardless of the coalition’s contribution to the anti-Islamic State struggle. Militias like KH sought the removal of international forces long before they killed an American on December 27, before they themselves were struck on December 29, and before their patriarchs, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia chieftain Aby Mahdi al-Muhandis, were killed by the U.S. on January 3 in a Baghdad drone strike. Now the militias are doubling their efforts, including issuing warnings to Iraqi officials and soldiers to distance themselves from the coalition (which they did not). In recent months, KH has threatened Iraqi MPs to vote to remove U.S. forces (enough of them resisted this call to prevent a vote with quorum) and threatened Iraq’s president Barham Salih if he met with President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum (he met Trump anyway).  Now KH is also issuing statements vetoing certain candidates for Iraq’s imminent selection of a new prime minister, suggesting which candidate should be picked (current premier Adel Abdal-Mahdi), and explicitly suggesting how the country’s most senior religious leaders should rule on the matter.  This is all unprecedented territory in Iraq, particularly the openness of the threats, similar to Iran’s recent elections where the regime blocked over 7,000 candidates for Parliament and invalidated a third of sitting MPs from seeking reelection.  The U.S. has clearly not yet deterred the militias from killing Americans and the result is that U.S. forces in Iraq are not being protected by either the Iraqi government or, ultimately, by our own government. This is not a sustainable situation. What can change? Last night’s strikes on KH missile and rocket bases were an attempt to take the high road, but the lack of large secondary explosions suggests that KH had evacuated its valuable weapons long before the strike. Iran’s militia proxies in Iraq can trade empty buildings or even two dozen of their own rank and file for three Anglo-American fatalities all day, every day. This a game we will lose. The right approach probably lies somewhere between the high and low roads, with very prompt, decisive and unclaimed attacks demonstrated against some senior Iraqi militia leaders in order to make others think very seriously about their personal future. But high-value leadership targets — which Iran and the militias do value — are generally not available to hit the day after Americans are killed: they are keeping their heads down. Congress and the administration need to sit privately and agree to some ground rules for the use of military force that allow the U.S. military to delink the timing of deterrent strikes, so that we can strike the right targets when they become available, to deter militia attacks that are highly likely to come otherwise. In parallel, the U.S. should toughen its mindset, quietly bringing the force protection assets into Iraq that it needs (i.e., Patriot missiles and anti-rocket close-in defenses) without further consultation with an Iraqi government that would rather adopt a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach.  And finally, the U.S. should let the militias keep over-reaching, keep showing their hand as would-be dictators under Iran’s control, while the U.S.-led coalition keeps helping Iraq to defeat the Islamic State. This is a game we can win.",How the U.S. Can Stop the Surge of Deadly Rocket Attacks in Iraq,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/iraq-airstrikes-shiite-militias-islamic-state-128210,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued Friday that the coronavirus pandemic presents ""a great investment opportunity,"" insisting that global markets spooked by the public health crisis will rebound eventually. ""This is a short-term issue. It may be a couple of months, but we're going to get through this, and the economy will be stronger than ever,"" Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. ""You know, I look back at people who bought stocks after the crash in 1987, people who bought stocks after the financial crisis,"" he continued. ""For long-term investors, this will be a great investment opportunity."" Despite the secretary's optimism, international anxiety over the coronavirus has provoked a historically negative reaction in recent days from Wall Street, alarmed at least in part by President Donald Trump's management of the mushrooming outbreak.  Following the president's prime-time address to the nation Wednesday evening, during which he announced a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from most of Europe, panicked investors triggered a marketwide trading halt for the second time this week and only the third time in history.  But Trump asserted Thursday that drastic measures to protect American lives justified any potential economic downturn and offered rosy predictions of a market recovery.  ""It's taken a big hit, but it's going to all bounce back, and it's going to bounce back very big at the right time,"" he told reporters at the White House. Mnuchin's remarks Friday echoed a similar assessment made last week by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who urged investors to capitalize on the faltering stock market amid coronavirus fears.

"The White House is holding up the nomination for one of the Pentagon’s top intelligence jobs because the official is not considered sufficiently loyal to the president, according to three current and former administration officials. Kathryn Wheelbarger, who has been serving as acting assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs since November 2018, would become the deputy undersecretary of Defense for intelligence if the nomination moves forward. But the holdup comes as President Donald Trump continues a post-impeachment loyalty purge that has already felled two senior Pentagon officials in recent weeks. The post that Wheelbarger would fill is one of 21 senior positions at the Pentagon that are empty or filled on a temporary basis, a record high for the Trump administration. Lawmakers have raised concerns in recent weeks that the department doesn't have enough qualified people in place to tackle the nation's biggest national security problems as it faces a host of crises, from the spread of the coronavirus to a new spike in tensions with Iran. The White House announced its intent to nominate Wheelbarger for the No. 2 position at the Pentagon overseeing military intelligence on Feb. 13, but it has not yet submitted her paperwork to the Senate, a spokesperson for the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed. By contrast, William Gillis, who the president announced would be nominated for assistant secretary of Defense for sustainment on the same day, had his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Wheelbarger, through a Pentagon spokesperson, referred comment to the White House, which declined to comment. In her current acting role, Wheelbarger has been the Pentagon’s point person on a host of issues, from the conflict in Syria to relations with NATO. On Tuesday, she testified alongside U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Frank McKenzie and U.S. Africa Command head Gen. Stephen Townsend on the U.S. peace agreement with Afghanistan, terrorist threats in West Africa and more. In particular, Wheelbarger has been “instrumental and a driving force behind the president’s efforts to seek 2 percent defense funding from NATO allies,” one administration official told POLITICO. “She hammered that message repeatedly.” But the White House is not satisfied that Wheelbarger is sufficiently loyal to the administration, the three current and former officials said. The people pointed to Wheelbarger’s two years spent working for the late Sen. John McCain, who feuded publicly with Trump before his death in 2019, as the root of the current tension. But the administration official said the White House is wrong about Wheelbarger, noting that she has worked for Trump for 50 percent longer than she did for McCain. Wheelbarger also declined to testify before Congress during the impeachment inquiry, the official said, explaining that she and her lawyer convinced congressional staff that she would not be able to provide additional information for the case. This is not the first time the White House has intervened on Pentagon personnel issues. The Trump administration demanded the ouster of John Rood, then-undersecretary of Defense for policy, in February, and has since rejected several of Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s choices to replace him. The White House personnel office, which is led by Trump loyalist John McEntee, put forth its own candidate to replace Rood: Elbridge Colby, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of Defense and is one of the primary authors of the National Defense Strategy. The White House also recently withdrew the nomination of Elaine McCusker to be Pentagon comptroller after emails emerged showing her questioning the administration’s suspension of military aid to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of the impeachment. “Unless you are here to support him personally, he’d rather have gaps,” said one former administration official.",White House holding up DoD nomination amid Trump loyalty purge,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/defense-nomination-trump-loyalty-128244,politico

"President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would eliminate the interest on federal student loans ""until further notice"" as part of a package of emergency executive actions designed to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. “To help our students and their families, I’ve waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies and that will be until further notice,” Trump said during a Rose Garden address where he declared a national emergency. “That’s a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed.” The unprecedented move will provide relief to the more than 42 million Americans who owe more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding federal student loans. But it did not go as far as what some Democrats had proposed, which was a suspension of monthly loan payments or loan forgiveness. The department was considering instructing loan servicers to lower the interest rate on federal loans to zero percent, according to individuals familiar with the plan. Under that approach, a borrower's monthly payment amount would not automatically change, though any payments the borrower did make would likely pay down a greater share of the principal balance. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ""is proud to work with the President in taking decisive action to help students and parents during this national emergency,"" department spokesperson Liz Hill said in a statement. The new policy will be implemented by the Education Department, which was scrambling on Friday to issue instructions and guidance to the companies it hires to manage the monthly payments of borrowers. A department official said that the interest waiver would be automatically applied to all borrowers, effective Friday, even though it may take some another week to fully ""operationalize"" the policy. It's not clear how much money the interest waiver will save borrowers, but it could be billions of dollars, depending on how long the Trump administration keeps the policy in place. In fiscal 2019 alone, the Education Department reported that it charged more than $100 billion in interest on all federal student loans. Federal student loans already offer options for borrowers to defer payments under certain circumstances, including an economic hardship, though interest can continue to accrue. Trump's suspension of interest payments, combined with those existing benefits, could mean that some Americans would be able to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who have long pushed for sweeping student debt relief from the federal government have said in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the need to provide assistance to Americans struggling with monthly loan payments. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a tweet that Trump's action was ""not enough"" to help student loan borrowers. ""Donald Trump & @BetsyDeVosED need to cancel student loans, not just waive interest or suspend payments,"" she said. ""Suspending payments or interest just delays the pain."" However, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) tweeted that it was a ""good step"" and that ""With so much uncertainty in the economy, we need to continue to look at every available means of providing relief."" Senate Democrats earlier this week included a six-month moratorium on some federal student loan payments on their list of items they’d like to see in an economic rescue legislative package. The National Consumer Law Center, which represents low-income student loan borrowers, has also called for a moratorium on student loan payments. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that pausing student loan payments was among the ""list of 50 different items"" that Trump's advisers planned to present to him to shore up the economy and financial markets due to the coronavirus pandemic. “That’ll be something we’re looking at,” Mnuchin said during an interivew on CNBC. “We have lots of authorities,” Mnuchin said, adding that on “things where we don’t have authorities, we’re going to work with both the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis. I can assure you the president is all about action, action, action.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has called for sweeping student loan forgiveness, tweeted earlier in the day that she was ""thankful"" that the Trump administration was ""taking pausing student loan payments seriously."" She called it ""a decisive move that will help stabilize millions of people. We should do it now. There is much more to be done, but every step counts."" The Education Department on Friday was still determining the mechanics of how to carry out Trump's announcement. The department has decided that the policy will automatically apply to all borrowers with federal direct loans, federally held Family Federal Education Loans and federally held Perkins Loans, according to a department official. Borrowers whose loans are in income-based repayment or in forbearance will still qualify. ""This will be operationalized over the next week or so, and it will be retroactive back to today,"" the official said. Borrowers could potentially seek a recalculation of their monthly payment under income-driven repayment plans or some would qualify for forbearance options, which would now be a way to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Much of the implementation will fall to the nine companies that the Education Department hires to collect and manage the payments of federal student loan borrowers. “Servicers and the Department have already begun discussions on how to implement this response to the current situation and we look forward to being able to provide more information to borrowers very shortly,” said Scott Buchanan, the president of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, the trade association that represents the companies. “Servicers will be updating websites in the coming days with information as soon as it becomes available.”",Trump to waive interest on federal student loans 'until further notice',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-administration-student-loan-payments-suspension-128181,politico
"The House passed sweeping legislation Saturday to respond to the coronavirus outbreak battering the nation, an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to expand access to free testing, provide $1 billion in food aid and extend sick leave benefits to vulnerable Americans. The bill's bipartisan passage, 363-40, was virtually assured when President Donald Trump backed the measure — largely hammered out by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and urged Republicans to support the bill. Trump's tweet, just before 9 p.m., capped several days of whiplash as Democrats and the White House appeared, at times, inches from a deal only to see it yanked away amid technical disputes and inconsistent signals from the president. Trump's backing, though, was essential to ensure support from congressional Republicans for the multi-billion dollar plan.  Democrats put the bill on the floor shortly after midnight under an expedited process and passed it in the early hours of Saturday morning, sending it to the Senate, which is expected to take it up as early as Monday.  The bill is the product of a painstaking effort by Pelosi to pass a measure with bipartisan support rather than a doomed Democrat-only bill that the Senate would have immediately spiked.  ""[W]e thought it would be important to show the American people, assure the American people, that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them,"" Pelosi said. ""So we thank our Republicans — those who will be supporting the bill. We appreciate the president joining us with his tweet."" Pelosi said the final bill came together slowly because of a laborious review process in the executive branch, which required approvals from multiple agencies and officials. Pelosi praised Mnuchin for his cooperation, and she acknowledged she never directly spoke with Trump about the bill. ""There was no need for that,"" she said. Alongside Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected House committees to be working through next week's recess on a new bill meant to address the economic damage wrought by coronavirus, which has devastated the airline, hospitality and entertainment industries. For now, though, Democrats said they were pleased to pass a bipartisan plan that they expect to pass overwhelmingly in the House and move through the Senate by Monday. ""I think this was a very good sign of bipartisanship and working together, that we can overcome this virus. We’ve done much bigger things before,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday night, minutes after the deal was announced.  On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted: ""Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!"" Trump's approval came after a hard-fought — and chaotic — day of negotiations, with Democrats and Republicans alike unsure whether the president was on board with the proposal. For several hours before Trump's tweet, talks had devolved into a state of confusion, with key officials on both sides directly contradicting each other on whether a deal exists. ""Because it was essential for us to have legislation pass the House by this weekend, it required intense and constant negotiations for what could have been an elusive agreement,"" Pelosi said in a letter to fellow Democrats after 10 p.m. on Friday, thanking them for their patience amid the frenetic back-and-forth with the administration. Pelosi had announced to her members shortly after 6 p.m. that she had reached a deal. But House Republicans — and even Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat — had said talks were still ongoing and a deal had not yet been reached. Key Republicans cautioned that there were still lingering issues related to a tax credit for paid family sick leave. McCarthy later confirmed that Republicans sought more flexibility for small business owners who would be forced to offer paid leave to affected workers.  Adding to the confusion, Mnuchin surprised even members of his own party by announcing on Fox Business that he had reached an agreement with Pelosi. The Treasury secretary had huddled with Trump just minutes before — a meeting that delayed his appearance on the network for so long that Mnuchin ran out of time to speak before the program ended. Trump eventually tweeted his support hours later, delivering long-awaited relief to hundreds of members and aides who had spent 48 hours in limbo awaiting any updates about the status of the funding package. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,"" Trump tweeted. ""I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"" One of the other major obstacles involved the president's personal demand for a payroll tax cut in this package. That idea has little support on Capitol Hill, and Democrats have already said it would be debated as part of future coronavirus crisis-related legislation at a later date. McCarthy, who met with Trump and Mnuchin multiple times in the last 24 hours, confirmed that Trump had sought the last-minute addition, and said Republicans would push for it in Congress's next tranche of economic relief, which could come later this month or in April. ""I believe this will not be the only one,"" McCarthy said, alluding to future aid packages related to the outbreak. ""This is something that the president wants, we would have liked to have that as well. I think that would have taken a little more time."" Mnuchin earlier in the talks had also expressed concerns that a tax credit to offset the cost of Democratic-proposed sick leave provisions wouldn't work as advertised.  During Trump's White House press conference to announce a national emergency declaration on Friday afternoon, the president complained, ""We don't think the Democrats are giving enough,"" even as Capitol Hill Republicans had been framing the differences as largely technical. Pelosi and Mnuchin then got on the phone again to try to finalize an agreement. The last remaining issues came down to how businesses can receive a tax credit for providing paid sick days and emergency leave for workers who are suffering from the coronavirus or helping take care of family members who contract the disease.  Pelosi and Mnuchin exchanged at least 20 phone calls on Thursday and Friday as they tried to hammer out a proposal that Trump could support.  Both Republicans and Democrats in the House insisted that they would not leave Washington until they could approve the massive package, which would work to both stem the outbreak by offering free testing and offering paid time off, while shoring up support systems for low-income workers, including school lunch meals and unemployment insurance. The legislation includes 14 paid sick days for employees, as well as three months of paid emergency leave throughout the coronavirus crisis. Employers will be reimbursed for some of these costs through tax credits. At GOP insistence, the emergency leave provision will expire in a year. And Republicans were able to insert language exempting smaller businesses from the requirements. The legislation helps provide free food for children whose schools are closed during the crisis, as well as other initiatives to make sure seniors and food banks get help as well. One of the biggest provisions involves free testing — which has been one of the major shortcomings in the U.S. response to the outbreak so far. ""This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,"" Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues announcing the agreement. ""To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge."" The House plans to go into recess for a week. That break, though, may be extended if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Hoyer, who sets the floor schedule, has said Democrats and Republicans are taking the situation day by day and consulting with medical experts and Capitol safety officials. The package comes amid a sense of deep unease on Capitol Hill with both the growing outbreak and the chaotic way that negotiations were led. Several House Democrats expressed complaints about the process, including Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who wrote on Twitter: ""We have ~46% of the House awaiting the @potus to tweet support before they’ll vote, and 100% of the House afforded an hour or so to read and consider one of the most important measures on which we’ll ever vote. It’s not how good governance should work, even during a pandemic."" Pelosi acknowledged that the negotiations were not ideal, suggesting that future legislation would be drafted and approved in a different fashion. ""As we proceed with further legislation, we will do so happily under a different timetable and continue to welcome any suggestions you have,"" Pelosi wrote in her Friday night letter to colleagues. The anxiety has also been compounded by the growing numbers of lawmakers and aides who are intentionally isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus. A staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) has tested positive for coronavirus, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced Friday morning that he would be extending his self quarantine until March 17 “out of an abundance of caution.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told POLITICO he is consulting with doctors on what he should do after news came out that a Spanish right wing politician, Santiago Abascal, he met with on March 2 tested positive for the coronavirus. He said he’s sure he shook Abscal’s hand but added he “feels fine.” He’s currently staying home and has canceled all events in his home state.  A spokesman for Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who also met with Abascal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Smith is doing.  More than 1,400 people in the U.S. have been infected, though many health experts fear that number is dramatically undercounted given the lack of availability of testing.

"The U.S. is shoring up its defenses in the Middle East after tit-for-tat attacks between the U.S. military and an Iran-backed Shia militia group stoked new tensions in the region this week, the top U.S. general in the region announced Friday. Following the Wednesday rocket attack on Camp Taji, Iraq, that killed U.S. and British service members and a retaliatory U.S. and British airstrike on five locations in Iraq on Thursday, the U.S. military will continue to operate two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Harry S. Truman, Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. This is the first period of extended dual U.S. carrier operations in the Middle East since 2012, he said. McKenzie stressed the symbolic significance of keeping two U.S. carriers in the region, noting that the vessel ""is a floating piece of American sovereignty."" ""We know the Iranians watch them very closely,"" he said. In addition, the U.S. is moving Patriot missile defense systems, which are designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles of the type used by Iran, into Iraq. They may be joined by more weapon systems for countering rockets, artillery and mortars, known as C-RAM, McKenzie said. C-RAM is designed to knock down lower-altitude weapons such as the 107mm Katyusha rockets fired at Camp Taji on Wednesday, but they ""are not a panacea,"" he cautioned. Roughly 90,000 U.S. forces are operating in the area overseen by U.S. Central Command, including the Middle East and Afghanistan, up from the 80,000 that were there before the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike in January. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that some of these troops had begun to head home after several months without a significant attack; it is not yet clear if this reduction will continue. McKenzie declined to directly blame Iran for the attack, but noted that Kataib Hezbollah, the Shia militia group that launched the rocket barrage on Wednesday, is ""closely linked"" to Tehran. Kataib Hezbollah has been involved in 12 rocket attacks against coalition forces in the last six months, including a December attack on Kirkuk that killed an American contractor and led to a series of escalations that brought Washington and Tehran to the brink of war. The U.S. and British airstrikes launched on Thursday successfully hit and destroyed all five targets, all of which were Kataib Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, McKenzie said, noting that he expects minimal collateral damage. ""We believe that this is going to have an effect on deterring future strikes of this nature,"" McKenzie said.

"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Who gets saved and who collapses?,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says, ‘Well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made health care an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico
"The National Education Association announced Saturday that it is backing Joe Biden for president, handing the Democratic frontrunner a prized endorsement ahead of Tuesday’s big-state primaries as he aims to wipe out his last remaining major opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Lily Eskelsen García, president of the 3 million-member teachers union, praised the former vice president as a “tireless advocate for public education"" who understands the nation’s “moral responsibility to provide a great neighborhood public school for every student in every ZIP code.” The NEA is the nation's largest labor union. “For the past two years, the #RedforEd movement has proven the power of the National Education Association and the collective voice of our members to advocate for stronger public schools and opportunity for all students,” Eskelsen García said in a statement. “Now, with so much at stake in this election, educators are determined to use their voice to propel Joe Biden to the White House.” The endorsement precedes Tuesday’s key primaries in Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Ohio. NEA has members in every congressional district, including battleground states. Biden and Sanders (I-Vt.) are set to debate Sunday night just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open if he makes a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. The union’s members traditionally serve as national convention delegates and they have a high voter turnout rate. In the last presidential election, 89 percent of registered NEA members voted, according to the union. NEA endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Sanders early in the 2016 Democratic primary, though the move roiled Sanders backers in the union ranks. This time, union leaders waited to see how candidates performed in early primaries. “I'm not going to bring a recommendation before we see who actually can deliver votes,” Eskelsen García told POLITICO in January. The union's move on Saturday follows a lengthy process that included a questionnaire, videotaped interviews and multiple presidential forums. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, also an educator and an NEA member, have built “broad support” among members, a news release said. In her statement, Eskelsen García also lauded Biden’s support for better pay for teachers and increasing funding for support staff and paraprofessionals. “And Biden will fire Betsy DeVos and replace her with an education secretary who comes from a public school classroom and believes that educators must have a seat at the table when crafting education policy,” she said. Last month, the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union announced that it would encourage its local and state affiliates to back or endorse the presidential bids of Biden, Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to blockTrump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico

"Georgia has delayed its presidential primary due to coronavirus. The primary, which was originally scheduled for March 24, will now be held on May 19. Georgia is the second state to delay its presidential primary. Louisiana rescheduled its April 4 primary to June 20 on Friday. The virus, which has infected more than 2,700 people across the United States, has prompted school closures, the cessation of professional sports and, in many places, a prohibition on large public gatherings.  “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement, originally issued to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices.  In-person early voting has also been halted. A statement from state Sen. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, indicated that in-person and absentee ballots that have already been cast in the presidential primary will count. However, election officials in four states that are voting on Tuesday — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — said on Friday their primaries will go on as scheduled. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from top election officials read. After Tuesday, only one other state or territory has a presidential primary scheduled for the month of March: Puerto Rico. But party officials in the state have also requested the primary be moved. A statement from the Puerto Rico Democratic Party said Chairman Charles Rodriguez requested that the territory’s legislature postpone its primary until April 26, with the potential for the primary to be held later if the virus is still not contained.  Some election watchdogs fret that delaying primaries is a step too far, expressing worry that moving primaries could effectively suppress voters’ rights. “We all agree that the safety and health of the public is paramount, but steps can, and must be taken to protect voters and poll workers while also ensuring that the democratic process marches ahead,” read a joint statement issued after Louisiana's decision from dozens of groups, including The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP. “Sudden changes to election times, locations, and more have been proven to create barriers to, and in some instances the denial of, citizens their right to vote.” Election administrators in the four states voting on Tuesday have been scrambling to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Polling sites in high-risk places like nursing homes have been moved, and officials are instructing poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect voting areas. Voters have also been strongly encouraged to take advantage of early and mail-in voting as much as possible. However, early, mail, and absentee voting laws vary widely state-by-state. Some states — like Washington, which voted earlier this week — allow for expansive mail voting, limiting the amount of disruption the outbreak can cause for an election. But others only allow absentee votes with a valid excuse and have limited (or no) early voting, adding a barrier for some voters that likely cannot be lifted without legislative action from state lawmakers or executives. Elected officials and activists have started pushing for states to have more expansive absentee and mail-in voting in later primary states and for the general election, as fears over the long term effects of the virus’ spread builds.

"President Donald Trump assured Americans on Wednesday the deadly coronavirus was on the brink of disappearing. Two days later, he admitted it wasn’t. In the span of 48 hours this week, from the moment markets plunged after a confusing and stiff Oval Office address to his national emergency declaration from the Rose Garden, Trump watched his own assessment of the viral outbreak transform in extraordinary fashion, forcing him into a course correction. The unprecedented shutdown of the world’s largest economy — a nation of 330 million people — will mark the most consequential stretch of Trump’s presidency and transform how Americans think about their government. For Trump himself, the journey appeared to represent a recognition that his earlier path threatened to engulf a nation he oversees with a spreading pandemic and diminish hope for reelection this fall. Trump’s do-over approach — he unlocked $50 billion in government funding on Friday to address the growing crisis and threw his support behind House Democrats’ aid package hours later — followed weeks of the president shrugging off the coronavirus threat and making statements about the availability of tests, the severity of the virus and the development of a COVID-19 vaccine that his own officials had to correct, sometimes within minutes of being made. During a visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump said the virus “will go away” and said his response was “really working out.” Instead, the forecast grew worse. State and local leaders, business executives and tens of millions of ordinary Americans leapfrogged their president — without waiting for White House guidance — to shut down public spaces, schools, offices and other gathering spaces and encourage millions of Americans to hunker down for a fast-spreading, invisible threat. Even as the stock market rebounded Friday in response to Trump’s release of emergency funding, the week ended with a mystery about whether America’s 73-year-old commander-in-chief, who has downplayed concerns about a virus that disproportionately impacts the elderly, could potentially be the world’s highest-ranking vector. During a rare appearance in the White House briefing room on Saturday, donning a “USA” ball cap, Trump said he was tested Friday night for COVID-19, and has started receiving temperature checks. The news came hours after a top Brazilian official at Mar-a-Lago last weekend — who dined with the president and many of his top aides — tested positive for the virus. (The White House physician said late Saturday that Trump’s test was negative.) The White House began administering temperature checks this weekend to “any individuals who are in close contact” with Trump or Pence, a spokesman said. This included members of the press corps who were stopped by a staff physician at the entrance to the James S. Brady briefing room Saturday afternoon. “SOCIAL DISTANCING!” Trump tweeted prior to the news conference and one day after he was seen repeatedly shaking hands with corporate CEOs and health officials during his televised remarks from the Rose Garden.  Rebuffing the precautionary isolation measures his own aides were taking, Trump will now spend the weekend sifting through options with White House staff — some of whom are fresh off self-quarantines — about the mechanics of a bailout for industries devastated financially by the virus outbreak. White House aides headed into the complex early Saturday morning for the next round of urgent discussions, a recognition of the tight timeline they’re facing to rescue key sectors of the economy such as transportation and tourism. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are assembling a list of options for Trump to consider as he looks to rescue crumbling industries and protect their workforces, according to two senior administration officials.  At Saturday’s briefing, Mnuchin specifically cited the airlines, cruise ships and hotels as industries that have faced significant challenges from the abrupt crash in global travel and tourism.  Trump’s desire to leap to the assistance of certain industries stems in part from witnessing an upward swing in U.S. markets after he designated the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency on Friday. The declaration had been in the works already, but was pushed up amid historic volatility in financial markets — much of which stemmed from an Oval Office address Wednesday night in which Trump stated he was banning all travel and imports from Europe, which the administration had to later clarify did not block all products and included only the 26-member countries of the unrestricted travel Schengen zone. (The ban will be extended to the U.K. and Ireland, which aren’t members of Schengen.) Trump also claimed insurers would cover the full cost of testing and treatment — generating alarm from health plans that never agreed to waive all patient costs. Outside the White House, many of the president’s political allies viewed Wednesday’s Oval Office address as a speech that quickly needed a do-over. Staring directly into a camera while seated with his hands crossed was not the best format for the president, Trump’s own aides later admitted.  The crushing response on Thursday prompted the White House to schedule Friday’s press conference in the Rose Garden, a favorite venue of the president thanks to its natural lighting and the more free-wheeling format of a back-and-forth press conference, according to two White House officials familiar with the matter.  The president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — among the few officials to maintain the president’s trust throughout his term — also became much more deeply involved in the coronavirus response efforts later in the week as it became clear the White House needed a more forceful response, a senior administration official said.  Internally, aides started to blame officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for flawed testing kits and the amount of time it took to get results back. The administration’s internal criticism of the CDC has made the agency the latest scapegoat as Trump’s team sought to deflect blame and cushion the president from what could become devastating political blowback against the president and his party in the coming months. Morale inside the White House bottomed out on Friday, said a third senior administration official, but turned a corner once the Food and Drug Administration approved a new COVID-19 detection test from the pharmaceutical company Roche as part of an emergency authorization. “They reached the conclusion this week that they had to communicate a sense of seriousness about what was going on and had to reassure the country that they were taking it very seriously,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who remains a close ally of Trump. “Having major companies like Wal-Mart, CVS, etc. involved means suddenly you begin to see how you can move to scale for a country for our size.” The Friday Rose Garden speech, where Trump announced a public-private partnership on testing and the immediate opening of emergency operation centers across the U.S., also helped propel a stock market surge in the final hour of trading. One official later bragged the speech alone caused the “biggest market jump ever.” Trump has repeatedly boasted about the stock market’s rebound after the S&P 500 recorded its best single-day performance since 2008 on Friday — a 9% gain, reversing a Thursday plunge that marked the worst day since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. On Saturday, an unusually jovial Trump said he was “honored” to see positive movement in the markets following his news conference the day before — even joking that he should up the volume of his public appearances to further boost investor confidence.  “I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. Maybe five times per day. That was something to watch,” he said.  But not every element of the president’s course correction has gone smoothly.  Representatives from Google said they were caught off guard on Friday when Trump said the tech company was “helping to develop a website … to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location” for Americans who suspect they may have contracted the coronavirus. In a statement shared on Twitter from Verily, a subsidiary of Google, the company said it is still “developing a tool to help triage individuals for COVID-19 testing” that would initially only be available in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Elsewhere in his remarks, Trump disavowed involvement in disbanding a pandemic unit within the White House National Security Council and about the travel restrictions he has imposed on European countries. The president, more than three years into a presidency in which he has eagerly ejected pre-Trump officials, also blamed the Obama administration for testing shortages in the U.S. that have undermined containment efforts and sowed chaos at some hospitals. “I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,” Trump told reporters, while complaining that his predecessor “didn’t do testing” during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. (In fact, diagnostic kits shipped just weeks after the CDC identified the first case of the virus in April 2009.) Indeed, blaming his predecessors for troubles with his own administration's handling of the current pandemic has become a common tactic of late. He accused former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, on Thursday of overseeing “one of the worst [responses] on record” to a nationwide health epidemic, in reference to that H1N1 outbreak during Obama’s first year in office.  Trump also claimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been working with top Trump aides this week on an emergency aid package, was “trying to create a panic” when his administration faced criticism in late February about its slow response to the coronavirus outbreak.  He blamed Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell for contributing to the economic pullback by refusing to cut interest rates — despite historic action by the central bank this week to combat chaos in financial markets and an emergency rate cut last week.  As economic relief legislation stalled in the House on Friday, Trump said it was congressional Democrats’ fault because “all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things that they agreed to.”  “He has never accepted blame for things that have gone wrong under his watch. Why would he do so now?” said one Republican close to the White House, who claimed the tactic “has worked in the past” for the president.  Although White House aides felt confident about Trump’s message on Friday about testing and the stimulus package passed by the House early Saturday, aides also acknowledged that the next step in rescuing the economy — deciding which industries to bail out — will be much harder politically.  The potential cost of an industry bailout could upset Republican lawmakers who have grumbled for years about the ballooning national debt under their watch after fighting the Obama administration over even smaller deficits and debt levels.  “It quickly devolves into industry vs. industry and parochial stuff,” said one former senior administration official. Trump also remains intent on pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, continuing to drop it into his public remarks.  “If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!” he tweeted on Friday.  Democrats and Senate Republicans have been cool to that idea, in part because of the eye-popping price tag ($950 billion according to one estimate) and concerns among economists about whether it would be effective in preventing a severe economic downturn. As the president entered the weekend, however, he appeared intent on striking a more unifying tone. Before meeting with members of the coronavirus task force at the White House, Trump commended the “good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats” that led to the House’s passage of a bill that will expand paid emergency leave and provide tax credits for workers and employers affected by the coronavirus crisis. The legislation also includes $1 billion in food aid for low-income Americans.  “People really pulled together. Nice to see!” Trump tweeted. He even praised the media — whom he accused last week of trying to “inflame the CoronaVirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant” — for recent coverage of his administration’s response to the crisis. “Over the past 24 hours, I think the representation has been very fair. It’s been very fair,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.",From complacency to emergency: How Trump changed course on coronavirus ,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/how-trump-changed-course-on-coronavirus-129528,politico
"Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that he still plans to offer more details about a planned website to help screen people for coronavirus symptoms — a day after President Donald Trump's description of it as a massive Google project appeared to surprise even the company. ""Tomorrow, 5 o'clock, we'll have a very specific description tomorrow about when the website will be available,"" Pence told reporters at a White House news conference, adding that he thought the site would be available Monday. ""As we expand testing across the country, we want people to be able to go to a website,"" Pence added in response to a later question. ""There will be a questionnaire there to determine whether or not a test is in order, because we want to make sure that people are being tested that have the symptoms."" Trump had announced the project during a Rose Garden address Friday afternoon, saying that for people who may have coronavirus symptoms, the website will help ""determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location."" Trump added that ""we have many, many locations. ... We cover this country and large parts of the world."" But later on Friday, Google tweeted a statement from its life sciences affiliate, Verily, that described the project as having a more modest scope, at least initially. ""Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,"" said the company, which is owned by Google's parent, Alphabet. Google appeared to walk that back Saturday night by posting a Twitter thread much more consistent with the White House's description: ""Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information,"" it wrote, adding that this was in addition to ""Work being done by our sister company Verily to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area."" Google was also taking steps such as ""[p]romoting authoritative information through Google Search and YouTube"" and weeding out ""phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation."" Neither Google and Verily responded to attempts to reconcile their various statements with the administration's accounts. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Saturday that the site will incorporate ""everything they have learned about symptoms and screening"" for the virus. ""It's not just a simple checkbox website,"" she said. ""It's actually going to go through critical symptoms, and that's why we're giving ourselves the weekend to get it put up."" Friday's announcement instantly raised red flags among patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. Google recently came under fire over a deal with Ascension Health that grants the tech giant access to millions of patients' identifiable medical information. While Google contends the deal complies with federal privacy protections for health data, a Wall Street Journal report on the deal triggered an investigation by the HHS civil rights office and landed the company in the crosshairs of congressional privacy hawks. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have demanded answers from Google and Ascension. Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it’s critical for consumer privacy that Google doesn’t gather any personally identifiable information from the coronavirus website, and that it shouldn’t keep IP addresses or use any other “covert tracking techniques.” The White House has sought the tech industry's help bolstering its response to the expanding outbreak. U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios held a conference call Wednesday with representatives from large tech firms, including Google, Facebook and Amazon, to discuss their efforts to combat coronavirus-related online misinformation and ways artificial intelligence could be used to analyze medical research on the virus. “Cutting-edge technology companies and major online platforms will play a critical role in this all-hands-on-deck effort,” Kratsios said in a statement after the call. “Today’s meeting outlined an initial path forward and we intend to continue this important conversation.” Mohana Ravindranath, Darius Tahir and Steven Overly contributed to this report.",Pence promises more details on virus screening website,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/pence-coronavirus-website-129530,politico
"The White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland in an attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S., a further expansion of restrictions on air travel that haven’t been seen since Sept. 11, 2001. The administration had previously banned foreign nationals from flying into the United States from the 26 countries in the Schengen Area free movement zone, but not the U.K. and Ireland, despite the existence of the coronavirus in those countries. The ban on travel from other parts of Europe began at midnight on Saturday, White House officials said at a press conference on Saturday. The ban on the two new countries will be implemented at midnight Monday night, Eastern Daylight Time. Trump spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday, according to a readout released by the White House.  The move is sure to push airlines further into crisis after they have been struggling financially for weeks amid a steep slump in passenger demand. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said economic aid could soon be coming for airlines and cruise lines after Congress passed two pieces of coronavirus relief legislation that didn’t include provisions for those industries. ""We have a lot more we need to do with Congress, and the speaker and I have acknowledged that we will be working starting immediately,” Mnuchin said. “The airlines industry in particular, no different than after 9/11, has a very unique circumstances — the cruise industry, the hotel industry. I would say we’ve got a lot more work to do.” Airlines are already struggling with massive losses, with some carriers having more canceled flights than new bookings for April and May. Delta Air Lines announced Friday that it is slashing 40 percent of its flight capacity, a massive cut. The reduction in flights is the steepest in Delta's history, including the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks. A senior TSA official said Saturday that there has been a ""significant"" drop in the number of both domestic and international air travelers. ""This can be as much as 30 percent — some locations, higher,"" the official said. However, the White House and airlines have been in discussions about the impact the coronavirus is having on their businesses, and what aid might be needed. Nothing has been finalized or made public, but those discussions, for now, appear to be centered around letting airlines keep some of the excise taxes passengers pay as part of the price of a ticket. However, one of those charges typically is funneled to airports to help pay for capital improvements, and airports, themselves looking at billions in losses as travel continues to slump, are likely to fight such a change. Similarly, one of the taxes — about 7.5 percent of the cost of an airline ticket — is used to help pay to run the Federal Aviation Administration, which Congress may not endorse if it is waived for anything longer than a few months. The European travel ban does not apply to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents or their family members, but they will be directed to one of 13 airports with enhanced screening procedures in place. Some domestic travel restrictions may also be under consideration. When asked Saturday whether he was “considering other travel restrictions, perhaps domestically,“ President Donald Trump answered: “Specifically from certain areas, yes we are, and we’re working with the states and we’re considering other restrictions.”  On a call with reporters later Saturday, a senior DHS official said domestic travel restrictions weren't expected ""at this time."" Though the administration has been intensely focused on reducing flights from coronavirus-exposed countries, there are indications that health screenings for international travelers arriving at U.S. airports have been spotty. Passengers returning from coronavirus hotspots around the globe have reported that despite coming straight from countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks, Customs and Border Protection officers and health officers in U.S. airports did not ask them questions about their travel histories, take their temperatures or check them for coronavirus symptoms.

"President Donald Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said Saturday evening after the president held a press briefing on the administration's latest moves to combat the outbreak. The president consented to a test Friday night, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley said in a statement, and he remains symptom-free one week after dining with a Brazilian government delegation, some of whose members have tested positive for the illness, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The statement did not say if Trump will be re-tested. Trump said that he has been tested for coronavirus after being questioned about it during a Rose Garden address on Friday. “I also took the test last night,"" Trump said during the White House briefing. ""And I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking, 'Did I take the test?'"" Asked when test results would be returned, he said: ""A day, two days. They send it to a lab."" Trump also touted the bipartisan congressional funding package passed early Saturday and the rise in the stock markets following his Rose Garden address. ""I was honored to see that the stock market, you were mostly there with us, set a record in a short period of time, over 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the rose garden,"" Trump said. ""That was a record. All-time record. I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. How about five times a day? We'll do one five times a day."" He also announced that the White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland, also hinting that relief for the airline and cruise industry would be coming soon. The president was joined at the press event by Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and health officials, including Seema Verma, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, who have been leading the administration's response to the outbreak. Not present was Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose standing has been diminished in the wake of the outbreak.  ""Secretary Azar was at the coronavirus task force meeting this morning. He's back to work, and we will have a changing round-up of these presentations so we can get quickly to your questions,"" Pence said in response to a question about the absence of the administration's top health official. ""But secretary Azar is doing a remarkable job, and working seven days a week for the American people and making a difference."" The vice president, pressed on the messaging discrepancies from the White House around whether Trump needed to get tested, told reporters he’d consult with the White House physician on getting a diagnostic himself after today’s briefing. “Mrs. Pence and I will be more than happy to get tested,” he said, after stating that the physician on Friday night had said Pence and his wife didn’t have the “symptoms or contacts that would necessitate testing.” He also said he’d had his temperature checked earlier. White House staff barred at least one person from the press briefing room after checking the temperatures of journalists who gathered for the event Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel experienced a fever and flu-like conditions Friday evening and went to a Michigan hospital for treatment, according to the RNC. She is self-quarantining at home with her family. The president has been criticized for repeatedly shaking hands in public and on camera despite the advice of public health officials to refrain from the practice.  At the press briefing, he defended his actions but also said that ""getting away from shaking hands is a good thing."" Late Friday, press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a memo from Conley saying Trump had dined at Mar-a-Lago with a person who has since tested positive for coronavirus. Conley did not recommend testing the president as a necessity. Conley on Saturday said he had been in touch with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House Coronavirus Task Force and that his office is “encouraging the implementation of all their best practices.” Earlier Saturday, Trump hailed the bipartisan deal on a congressional coronavirus funding package on Twitter, adding that he'd attended a series of coronavirus-related meetings in the White House that morning.  He also tweeted: ""SOCIAL DISTANCING!"" As of Saturday, the U.S. had reached 50 reported coronavirus-related deaths and over 2,200 confirmed cases. Despite Trump’s announcement that’s he’s been tested, health officials at Saturday’s press conference urged Americans to begin isolating themselves instead of rushing to get tested if they’re not experiencing symptoms.  Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator said said Quest and LabCorp — two private labs currently running diagnostics — are reporting 98 percent to 99 percent of their tests are coming back negative for coronavirus.  Though early missteps have prevented widespread testing necessary to track the spread of the virus and isolate sick individuals, Birx and other administration health officials said they were optimistic about the steps the administration is taking to ramp up testing. The administration on Friday announced steps that would allow some labs that have been processing tens or hundreds of samples a day to instead handle thousands. The U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea can test in a day. Pence said the administration would release more details at a briefing Sunday evening on progress in the effort to expand testing. Health officials Saturday said they were optimistic that the new measures will allow the U.S. to begin understanding how the disease is spreading. “Now it's all systems go,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “As we get knowledge about new testing, we'll alleviate the anxiety that we have in the world about, we don't know what's going on.” “Now it's all systems go,” Fauci said. “Let's look forward.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report."," Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, White House physician says",2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-test-129444,politico

"The nation's top doctor on Saturday urged a widespread halt of hospital elective procedures amid mounting concern that the health system doesn't have enough beds to manage a potential surge of coronavirus cases. ""Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!"" U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted this morning.  He warned that every elective surgery could spread coronavirus within the facility, use up protective medical gear as public officials worry about shortages and burden a hospital workforce who ""may be needed"" to respond to COVID-19. Adams was responding to new recommendations from the American College of Surgeons issued Friday. The group said hospitals, health systems and surgeons should ""thoughtfully review"" all their scheduled operations and consider canceling or postponing them ""until we have passed the predicted inflection point"" in the disease spread and ""can be confident that our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.""

"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"Scott Gottlieb left the Trump administration nearly a year ago — but from Twitter to TV, he’s become the face of truth-telling about the coronavirus pandemic. The 47-year-old former Food and Drug Administration commissioner is providing blunt reality checks on talk shows and in congressional chambers, where his warnings about undetected outbreaks and testing delays starkly contrast with current administration officials’ assurances that the risk from the fast-spreading virus remains very low. “And all I say is, ‘Be calm.’ We have the greatest people in the world,” President Donald Trump told reporters on March 6 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “You never really know when something like this is going to strike and what it’s going to be.” Gottlieb had a different take. “People will suffer and die. The most vulnerable are at greatest risk,” Gottlieb tweeted the next morning. “We must all work together to protect them. The next few months will be hard, but we will preserve life, and eventually conquer this pathogen.” Gottlieb’s hard truths were finally embraced on Thursday morning by the president, who retweeted a series of Gottlieb’s warnings hours after Trump’s prime-time coronavirus address was widely panned. “We need to sacrifice some of the trappings of normal life to reduce the scope and severity of what’s ahead,” Gottlieb wrote — and Trump retweeted — in a series of tweets that also took shots at the ""void left by policy makers.” Gottlieb’s emergence has made him the rare Trump administration insider who’s found ways to critique his old colleagues’ decisions from outside while still maintaining respect in Trump's inner circle. In some ways his plain-spoken warnings mirror those of Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old NIH infectious disease expert who’s become a mainstay at congressional and White House task force briefings even as he contradicts the president’s reassurances or optimistic timelines. Widespread mistrust of the administration’s take on the coronavirus has enhanced the role of an outsider like Gottlieb. And his ubiquity has made his estimates even more valued. Some have pointed to a coronavirus testing tracker that Gottlieb and the free market American Enterprise Institute established this week to estimate how many people could be tested for the infection each day — an initiative that aggravated some government health officials, despite Trump’s retweets. Gottlieb also suggested that health systems could run coronavirus tests on a high-volume platform developed by drug giant Roche weeks before the administration authorized the strategy on Friday. The Monday morning quarterbacking, especially around early testing stumbles, has particularly ruffled some feathers in the health department, where HHS Secretary Alex Azar is already dealing with criticism from White House officials — and where current FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has been virtually invisible on television during the crisis. “I don’t know what his endgame is,” said one official, criticizing Gottlieb’s high profile, arguing that some of it’s come at the expense of his successor. “What’s he trying to prove, and why does he keep stepping on Hahn?” Some officials also grumbled after Gottlieb penned Wall Street Journal editorials about preparedness in January and early February, claiming that his warnings about silent coronavirus spread were too alarmist — even if they’ve turned out to be true. It’s set up the media-savvy former FDA chief — who remains in frequent conversation with the White House and won as much bipartisan support as any Trump appointee while in office — for inevitable run-ins with current health officials who don’t have the latitude to make the same kind of policy pronouncements. “He can say things that maybe the government would like to say because he has an authority,” said a source close to HHS. But at the end of the day: “They are making decisions that are going to affect 350 million Americans. He’s not.” Others on the inside of the coronavirus battle say Gottlieb has been indispensable to the White House and Pence in particular on response strategy. They say consternation is rooted in Azar’s insecurity about his role and concerns that he could be undercut by Gottlieb, who had been rumored as a shortlist pick for a so-called coronavirus czar. “I think good leaders want to bring the strongest, smartest minds in and surround themselves,” said one administration official. “But that’s not what they’re doing [at HHS].” A source close to Azar disputed that characterization and frustration with Gottlieb, and the idea Azar that has been sidelined.  Gottlieb was seen at the White House ahead of Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a source, and he later praised Trump's Rose Garden event. Gottlieb declined to comment for this story. He now divides his time between a fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute, serving on a handful of drug company boards and a career as a talking head who has the rare ability to explain complicated science in a way ordinary people can understand. Some of that has been to the administration’s adversaries on Capitol Hill. The libertarian doctor’s activist agenda as FDA chief, on everything from e-cigarettes to nutrition, often put him at odds with the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory approach. But Gottlieb sold his proposals well — and left the administration on rare good footing with the White House and lawmakers from both parties in Congress. “You do have big shoes to fill,” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) told Hahn, Gottlieb’s successor, at a House hearing Wednesday where Democrats grilled him on the flawed White House response to the coronavirus. Just one day earlier, Gottlieb gave his take on the state of the outbreak to Pocan and the rest of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at their invitation. “We don’t have a whole lot of, honestly, Trump appointees, American Enterprise Institute employees, come by to brief the Progressive Caucus. But he got it because we respect him so much,” Pocan told Hahn. Meanwhile, HHS has said it doesn’t know how many tests have been done, and the CDC has dropped its own count from its website. Instead, the administration has been updating how many tests have been shipped to labs, not how fast the troubled testing program can turn them around. Azar said the CDC is working to get its own testing tracker up. Gottlieb also has stepped into a void around Hahn, who has kept a low profile throughout the crisis — posting relatively few coronavirus tweets, making no appearances on prime-time TV programs, and waiting a month before the White House even added him to its coronavirus task force. And when asked about the testing numbers his predecessor is projecting, Hahn said it’s complicated. “I would want to get you the most accurate information possible,” he told lawmakers. Hahn, a cancer doctor and health system administrator, is constrained in ways that Gottlieb is not, allies argue. Two administration officials said that early testing delays were rooted in Azar’s decision early on to leave Hahn off the coronavirus task force, where he could have coordinated more easily with CDC Director Robert Redfield to let private labs roll out their own tests. “He wasn’t given the opportunity to be involved and that’s what created the problems,” said one administration official. Hahn was eventually brought on the task force, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams and CMS Administrator Seema Verma, after Vice President Mike Pence was tapped to take the lead. An HHS spokesperson said Hahn has been involved in briefing Azar and others from the very beginning and Azar is pleased he is part of the task force. “We are and have been focused on addressing this public health emergency, and not who was appointed to the task force or when,” Hahn said in a statement to POLITICO. Yet what looked like early stumbles and confusion among administration officials has driven frustration among lawmakers — and now they are turning to Gottlieb. “I just feel that there's been such confusion and miscommunication at the presidential level that we're constantly playing catch-up,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) whose state has reported at least nine cases of coronavirus. “Even though he's on the conservative side, you know the ideas that he's pushing forward are important and they've been smart,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who attended Gottlieb’s closed-door briefing with progressive members and whose state has become the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak. “His deep-seated interest in public health issues is genuine, it’s who he was before. It’s just getting more attention, it’s magnified now,” said a former HHS official. “What’s the long game? He’s going to keep writing op-eds.” Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.",The shadow coronavirus czar,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/shadow-coronavirus-czar-scott-gottlieb-129563,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"SEATTLE, Wash.—As of Friday, the coronavirus outbreak is officially a national emergency. But while most Americans are only just becoming familiar with social distancing and quarantining, Washington state has been dealing with the crisis since the first U.S. case was discovered there on January 20. The Seattle area, in particular, has become Ground Zero in the United States after the first death from the epidemic on February 29. Now, the buzzing birthplace of Starbucks and home of tech giants like Amazon has, in large part, shut down, foreshadowing what could come for the rest of the country. In Washington’s most populated city, large events and entire sports seasons are being cancelled or postponed; schools, libraries, community centers and the zoo are closing; some hospitals and prisons have banned visitors; and public health officials are urging businesses to allow employees to work remotely. Governor Jay Inslee has banned gatherings of 250 or more people in three counties, including Seattle’s King County. A usually bustling city is now eerily silent and still. Over the last week, Seattle-based photographer Chona Kasinger documented the ghost town that it’s become. Text by Ruairí Arrieta-Kenna. Pike Place Market is usually a hub of activity, filled with locals and tourists buying fish, flowers or produce. But what would usually be a busy weekend for the century-old farmers’ market was instead a sleepy Sunday on March 8—after the statewide total of known coronavirus cases crossed into triple digits and the number of deaths into double digits. Since King County officials urged employers on March 4 to allow people to work remotely, the once traffic-heavy city of Seattle has come to a near standstill. While many restaurants and shops remain open, many would-be patrons are staying home, and some businesses are starting to close. According to the Seattle Times, more than 50 restaurants and bars, including a dozen by local celebrity chef Tom Douglas, have already shut their doors in the past two weeks. In Seattle, much like other parts of the country, stores have been marked by long lines and low supplies as people stock up on provisions. The coronavirus is known to be deadlier to people over 60, with the vast majority of the 32 deaths in King County as of Saturday linked to a single retirement community. While young people have generally been spared from the virus’ worst symptoms and might feel less hesitant to avoid public places, state officials are weighing even more drastic measures to make sure they don’t become carriers of the disease.",America’s Coronavirus Ground Zero,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/seattle-ghost-town-coronavirus-ground-zero-128720,politico
"TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s official leading the response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East on Sunday acknowledged that the pandemic could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe U.S. sanctions. Muslim authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, would be closed indefinitely due to concerns about the outbreak, with prayers continuing to be held on the sprawling esplanade outside. Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government. Iran is battling one of the worst outbreaks outside China. On Sunday the Health Ministry reported 113 more deaths, bringing the country’s death toll to 724 amid 13,938 confirmed cases. The real number of infections could be even higher, as questions have been raised about the government’s transparency. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying earlier by the state-run IRNA news agency. Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed. Zali also acknowledged that “many” of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly. Health Ministry figures show that while 55% of fatalities were in their 60s, some 15% were younger than 40. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks. The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,800. More than 70,000 people worldwide have recovered after being infected. In Iran, the virus has infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials. Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open. Dalia Samhouri, a senior regional official with the World Health Organization, said both Iran and Egypt, two of the most populous countries in the Middle East, were likely underreporting cases because of the nature of the virus, which can be spread by individuals who show no visible symptoms. “We can easily say that the current figures are an underestimation of the actual figures,” she said. Iran has struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. The U.S. says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it. Countries across the Middle East have imposed sweeping travel restrictions, canceled public events and in some cases called on non-essential businesses to close for the coming weeks. In the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, a global business and travel hub in the United Arab Emirates, authorities announced on Sunday that all movie theaters, arcades and gyms would be closed through the end of the month. Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, also shut down its amusement parks and museums through the end of the month, including Louvre Abu Dhabi. The UAE’s central bank meanwhile announced a $27 billion stimulus package directed at supporting banks and said regulatory limits on loans will be eased. Saudi Arabia announced its own $13 billion stimulus plan. Al-Aqsa is the latest in a series of religious sites where access has been halted or strictly limited. Saudi Arabia has halted the umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and could be forced to limit or cancel the much larger haj later this year. On Sunday, it announced the temporary closure of all mosques and called off Friday prayers. Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the director of the Al-Aqsa mosque, said Sunday that the closure of the mosque and other buildings on the compound, including the iconic golden Dome of the Rock, would continue indefinitely. The religious site is also the holiest in Judaism because it was the location of the two Jewish temples in antiquity. Israel occupied and annexed east Jerusalem in the 1967 war in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, and the religious site has often been a flashpoint in the decades-long conflict. Israel imposed sweeping travel and quarantine measures more than a week ago but has seen its number of confirmed cases double in recent days, to around 200. On Saturday, the government said restaurants, malls, movies, gyms and daycare centers would close. Schools and universities have already been shut down until next month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial on serious corruption charges, which was supposed to begin this week, was postponed for two months due to restrictions on public gatherings. Netanyahu has meanwhile been pressing for an emergency unity government with his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, following three inconclusive elections and more than a year of political deadlock. Gantz has appeared open to the idea. Jordan, which had previously reported just one infection in a man who later recovered, confirmed six new cases. Four are French tourists while the other two are Jordanians, Health Minister Saad Jaber said Sunday. Jordan has suspended all flights into and out of the kingdom except for aid workers and diplomats, and has closed schools for two weeks. It has also banned the smoking of hookahs, or water pipes, in cafes.",Iran says worsening outbreak could strain health facilities,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/iran-says-worsening-outbreak-could-strain-health-facilities-129895,politico
"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination, and staying in the race just to try to convince Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential question in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. Back in 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before, but only after nomination by this party.” He called Ike the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Richard Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisors, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most important. when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed onto platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on the civil rights. On that issue, the Compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious that Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base, and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African-Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for “the Dreamers”—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for the undocumented. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers, and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of the Sanders’ supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: when and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, not Burlington.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to block Trump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",2 senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and so not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the new restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash for Americans abroad to return home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anothony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member you can get back. You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s new travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. But Fauci said Sunday that there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there was anything airports could do to try and mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back, it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, from Sophocles to Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared exactly the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran; to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad; and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. “The Plague” is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe, and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, where plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only five at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from the divine will and the rise of conmen to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene where blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short-lived, and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence, and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extra-marital liaisons, who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, “The Betrothed” gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the so-called “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. “The Last Man” by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakens Athens in its war with Sparta, and claims the life of the city’s great statesman Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparks a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to commit suicide in bizarre ways.

"Top health official Anthony Fauci said Sunday that after strict containment and mitigation, China’s coronavirus outbreak is “coming down right now.” On ABC’s “This Week,” the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that it takes several weeks to a few months for the outbreak to dwindle, pointing to China and South Korea as examples.  China, where COVID-19 first set off alarms, passed through the worst, Fauci said. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the country has had the bulk of the cases and fatalities: nearly 81,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,200 deaths.  Recently, China reported just 11 new cases — minuscule compared to the numbers it used to see, Fauci said. South Korea’s coronavirus spread is also starting to flatten. “If you look at that bracket, all of that was a couple of months, a month-and-a-half for China,” he said Sunday. “The way you interfere with that … depends on the effectiveness in which you do the kinds of controls that we've been talking about, the containment and the mitigation.”  China, Fauci added, really dramatically practiced “social distancing” when officials shut down the country. Now, all eyes are on what happens as people resume normal life.  “It's over for now and hopefully for good,” Fauci said. “As they start getting back to normal personal interaction, I hope we don't see the second blip, but it's possible.”  The worst may also be over in South Korea, Fauci said. “Korea is starting to flatten and maybe come down a little,” he said. Worldwide, there are over 156,000 confirmed cases and over 5,800 deaths. In the United States, there have been more than 2,900 cases and 57 deaths. Many public spaces, schools and offices have closed as millions of Americans are encouraged to reduce close contact with others.  On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted to reinforce that message: “SOCIAL DISTANCING!”",Top U.S. health official: China’s situation is improving,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-china-korea-130027,politico
"The nation’s top infectious disease expert warned Sunday that Americans should prepare to take far more drastic steps to blunt the rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which has sickened thousands of Americans across the country and prompted calls for a wide-scale withdrawal from public life. “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview airing on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His warning comes as the virus has caused the cancellation of events across the globe, as well as travel bans — and in some countries, domestic travel restrictions. Health officials have warned Americans to practice social distancing to limit the amount of community transmission and avoid overwhelming an already-strained health care system.  Asked Sunday whether he would favor the kind of national lockdown ordered by Italy’s prime minister, Fauci said he would rather err on the side of being “overly aggressive.”  “You know, I would prefer as much as we possibly could,” Fauci responded. “I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.” Fauci said he’d broached these concerns with the White House, which has taken increasingly significant steps over the last week as the number of U.S. cases exploded. He said that there had not been pushback to his suggestions, noting that “in fairness, they listen and they generally go with what we say.” While Fauci said “much more” needed to be done on the social distancing front, he conceded that some Americans would ultimately do what they please. “I mean, obviously, you're going to have people who are going to go to restaurants anyway,” he said, when asked by “Meet the Press” anchor Chuck Todd about packed restaurants and bars as people celebrated St. Patrick’s Day over the weekend. “But for the most part, and particularly, if I can say this, this is particularly appropriate and relevant for people at the higher risk. The elderly and those who have underlying conditions right now should really hunker down.” He reiterated, though, that it was better to be safe than sorry.  “The golden rule that I say is that, when you think you are doing too much, you are probably doing enough or not enough,” he argued, urging Americans not to be “complacent.”  “Don’t even, for a second, think that I am saying we shouldn’t — I like to be criticized,"" he added. ""When I say oh, you are being too overactive, that is good for me.”",Fauci: Americans should be prepared to 'hunker down' even more,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fauci-americans-hunker-down-130035,politico
"Voters are divided along party lines on how President Donald Trump is handling the burgeoning coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., according to a new poll out Sunday that shows a majority predicting it won’t change their lives in a significant way. Nearly half of voters in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 45 percent, approve of the job Trump is doing in handling the outbreak, slightly fewer than the 51 percent who disapprove. That nearly matches Trump’s overall approval rating of 46 percent, which is statistically unchanged from a month ago. The partisan split on Trump’s handling of the virus is wide: While 81 percent of self-identified Republican voters approve of how the president is handling the situation, 84 percent of Democrats disapprove. Among independent voters, 43 percent approve, and 52 percent disapprove. More strikingly, a significant share of voters, mostly Republicans, say they don’t expect the outbreak to have major effects on their daily lives — a view that runs counter to the recommendations of public-health officials. The poll was conducted March 11-13, surveying 900 registered voters. It went into the field the day of Trump’s address to the nation on the outbreak on Wednesday, the same day the NBA suspended its season after a player, Utah’s Rudy Gobert, contracted the virus and actor Tom Hanks announced he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, had also tested positive for coronavirus. Only 15 percent of voters say they expect the virus to change their lives “in a very major way,” and an additional 26 percent say they think it will change their lives “in a fairly major way.” But 39 percent expect only “small” changes, and 17 percent say it won’t change their lives in any way. The combined 41 percent who expect major changes to their lives includes 56 percent of Democrats, but only 26 percent of Republicans. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say they have or will be canceling travel plans (47 percent, versus 23 percent) or plan to stop eating at restaurants (36 percent, versus 12 percent). “Simply put, it is very clear that partisanship has infected our views of the coronavirus,” Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt told NBC News. Voters do expect things to get worse: Roughly six-in-10, 60 percent, said the worst is yet to come. But 6 percent said the worst was already passed, and 31 percent said they don’t expect coronavirus to be a major problem in the U.S. And despite the effects already seen — a wave of cancellations of public events, the tumbling stock market and the strain on the health care system — the share of voters saying the country is headed in the right direction (37 percent) is statistically unchanged from last December (35 percent). Voters are split on their confidence in Trump to handle the crisis: 48 percent say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in Trump, while 50 percent no or “not very much” confidence in him. By contrast, voters are more confident in their state government (75 percent great deal or fair amount of confidence), their local government (72 percent) or the federal government as a whole (62 percent). The poll also tested opinions of Democratic voters following last week’s presidential primaries. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the first choice of Democrats, with 61 percent saying they would favor him if a primary were being held in their state today. That’s nearly double the percentage choosing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 32 percent. Four percent of Democrats choose Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). In hypothetical general election matchups, both Biden and Sanders lead Trump, though Biden’s 9-point advantage, 52 percent to 43 percent, is slightly larger than Sanders’ 4-point lead, 49 percent to 45 percent. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for all registered voters, and 4.7 percentage points for Democratic primary voters.",Poll: Voters split on Trump’s handling of coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/poll-voters-coronavirus-outbreak-130033,politico
"Illinois’ governor complained late Saturday that new travel restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic have led to an impossible situation at Chicago’s biggest airport. “The crowds & lines O’Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately,“ Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted Saturday. He added: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.“ Enhanced screening for returning travelers from Europe is creating massive logjams at U.S. airports, with travelers waiting hours in long lines to get their luggage and clear customs. Having travelers stuck in huge crowds — while public health officials urgently advise people to keep their distance — is also creating concerns that the virus could spread at airports. “To the frustrated people trying to get home, I have spoken with the mayor and our Senators and we are working together to get the federal government to act to solve this. We will do everything within our power to get relief,” the governor tweeted. Mayor Lori Lightfoot echoed Pritzker’s criticisms on Twitter: “This is unacceptable.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday dodged questions about whether the coronavirus pandemic could plunge the U.S. into a recession, insisting that the reeling stock market would eventually get back on track and that the Trump administration is more focused on targeting short-term relief to those most impacted by the fast-spreading disease.  In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the secretary repeatedly sought to avoid getting pinned down on a number of issues relating to the surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. after he spent the last week negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the details of an economic aid package that he referred to as just the “second inning” of relief. “I wouldn't focus on the technical issue of whether we are going to be in a recession or not,” Mnuchin told host Chris Wallace, arguing that the administration is more concerned about what it can immediately do to blunt the impact of the outbreak. The virus has prompted the shuttering of schools, the cancellation of sporting and entertainment events and outright travel bans, while fears over the novel coronavirus have contributed to a turbulent month on Wall Street.  The stock market over the last few weeks has shattered records for its greatest one-day gains but also for point drops, posting numbers not seen since the 1987 crash and ending an 11-year bull market run. The Federal Reserve has already stepped in to try and calm investors' fears, but those moves have gotten bowled over by new developments in the outbreak.  But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin continued, arguing that the current market rout has very different origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus wasn’t comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus,” he argued. Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment was the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill that Congress approved earlier this month, and would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship -- there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how much of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushed back on the idea that the relief measures currently under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2009 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, Mnuchin argued that there were no such issues contributing to the current market tumble. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico

"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash of Americans abroad returning home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member, you can get back. You don't need to rush back — you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. Fauci said Sunday there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there is anything airports could do to try to mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back — it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" In a statement, the Biden campaign signaled that the former vice president is not planning on hammering away at contrasts with Sanders and instead wants to focus on Trump. Biden is ""honored to share the stage with Sen. Sanders, who he considers a good friend and whose values and leadership he admires,"" said Andrew Bates, Biden’s rapid response director. For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"Massive lines ballooned across several U.S. airports this weekend as European travelers made a mad dash for home — a situation created by the quick rollout of the Trump administration’s European travel ban and exacerbated chronic airport staffing shortages.  U.S. officials promised Sunday to address the most visible sign of the chaos — the jam-packed terminals where Americans returning to the U.S. are waiting hours for virus screening at several major airports, including Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth and Dulles International. But those lines are just one of a series of pressure points that have undermined the administration’s efforts to keep the virus from entering the country — and now threaten to hasten its spread: — The administration’s European travel ban, which President Donald Trump announced Wednesday and went into effect Friday night, sent Americans abroad scrambling to find plane tickets back home. U.S. officials eventually clarified that the ban didn't apply to American citizens or permanent residents — but by then, panic-buying most likely inflated the number of people trying to reenter at once. — The administration also dramatically narrowed the number of places where air travelers returning from Europe could enter the U.S. — currently just 13 airports. At the same time, Customs and Border Protection and health officials on Friday began doing ""enhanced screening"" for those passengers, consisting of temperature checks and questions about travel history and symptoms, without having enough staff on hand to process them quickly. — Customs staffing levels have been inadequate for some time. The union representing Customs screeners said at a hearing in December that the force was short 2,700 officers, partly as a result of the administration’s decision to temporarily reassign people to the U.S.-Mexican border. — In the early weeks of the outbreak, the administration was slow to ramp up screening at international airports, even for travelers re-entering the United States from known coronavirus hot spots. Harvard public health researchers warned in early March that the screening procedures in place then would miss as many as two-thirds of U.S.-bound passengers entering the U.S. Now, public health officials are expressing concern that the passengers crammed shoulder-to-shoulder in airport screening lines are at higher risk for catching and then spreading the virus. “It’s not good public health policy to have crowds of people in tight spaces, especially people who are returning from places where we know there’s widespread transmission occurring,” said John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America’s Health. He added that there should be serious consideration of unintended consequences of the policies being implemented. Illinois leaders blamed the Trump administration for the latest mess, saying it was apparently unprepared to carry out its own orders. “Appears source of delays all federal and Admin was unprepared after Presidential ban on travel from Europe,” said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin on Twitter. The state’s governor, JB Pritzker, wrote: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Saturday that the added screenings are only taking around 60 seconds per passenger. But that doesn’t help if not enough screeners are on duty. And some passengers complained on social media that they waited as long as six or seven hours to be screened. CBP's acting commissioner, Mark Morgan, said in a statement Sunday that the agency is ""working diligently to address the longer than usual delays"" and several airports are already improving. A spokesperson was not able to provide details about any specific steps the agency had taken to get lines under control. ""We appreciate the patience of the traveling public as we deal with this unprecedented situation,"" Morgan said. ""We’re continuing to balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens through enhanced medical screening."" The thousands of people who have been jammed into close quarters while waiting for their bags and customs checks could be at a greater health risk because of the situation. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Fox News Sunday the crowds are “countermanding” the administration’s own mitigation efforts. Public health officials have frequently stressed the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. “What people need to understand is if you're an American is if you're an American citizen, you can get back,” Fauci said. “You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back but it's understandable how when people see the travel ban, they immediately want to hunker and get home. “Hopefully we don't have more of that, but I think we probably unfortunately will see that,"" he said. Mike Fraser, executive director for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the large crowds at ports of entry are concerning. “While travel home is essential for these individuals, I would hope federal and airport authorities would work with the airlines and state and local health agencies to practice appropriate infection control measures everywhere, but especially in places were crowds are gathered and recommend staggered arrivals to reduce the number of people congregating in one place, ""Fraser said. “At this time, the goal is to prevent transmission of disease. Any crowded space — churches, grocery stores, airports — all increase the probability of transmission,” said Joyce Johnson, a senior retired U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer. These enhanced screenings are also starting too late, following weeks while the virus was already rapidly spreading around the world. The administration’s initial screening efforts focused on travelers from China, even after it had become clear that the virus had spread to other countries. Marc Lipsitch, head of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, has said the lax screening of infected travelers may have led to the outbreak in Washington state, the first U.S. state the virus swept through. Before this weekend, alarmed passengers had reported on social media what they considered lax screening as they returned to the U.S. Jenn Bartick, a California attorney, told POLITICO that she flew back from Italy two weeks ago and went through “no screening of any type."" She said no one asked her if she had been in the parts of Italy that have been hardest hit by the virus, a spread that since prompted Italian authorities to shut down the entire country. She said when she boarded the plane in Italy, “they asked if I had been to China in the past 14 days. No further screening.” She’s been unable to get a test because she doesn’t have symptoms and is self-quarantining. A U.S. businessman who flew recently from Hong Kong told POLITICO that the screening he underwent at Los Angeles International Airport was ""a joke."" “As opposed to all arrivals and departures at all Asian airports there was no temperature taking,” said the businessman, who has lived in China and other Asian countries for decades and requested anonymity because he doesn't want to “get blacklisted on flights” to the United States added: “No questions, nothing. Couldn’t get rid of the passengers fast enough.” Customs officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about those passengers’ accounts. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has asked the federal government to expand screening beyond air travel, by requiring temperature checks for all passengers boarding not just airplanes but mass transit. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, told lawmakers last week that passenger screening “bought us time” but said travel restrictions and screenings were never “intended to be a hermetically sealed process.”",Terminal crush: Air passengers caught in Trump's travel ban,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/air-passengers-crush-coronavirus-trump-130251,politico
"The nation’s top infectious diseases expert has a stern warning to young people: Don’t get complacent about statistics showing that serious coronavirus cases and fatalities are skewed toward the elderly and those with underlying health issues.  “You are not immune or safe from getting seriously ill,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked if younger Americans should be concerned about contracting the virus, which Fauci has repeatedly said is more lethal than the average flu.  “Even though when you look at the total numbers, it's overwhelmingly weighted toward the elderly and those with underlying conditions,” he explained, “the virus isn't a mathematical formula. There are going to be people who are young who are going to wind up getting seriously ill.”  In addition, Fauci said it was critical for young people to understand that they can be a carrier for the virus and spread it without showing symptoms or feeling ill themselves.  “Even though you don't get seriously ill, you could bring it to a person who would bring it to a person that would bring it to your grandfather, your grandmother, or your elderly relative,” he argued. “That's why everybody's got to take this seriously, even the young.” In appearances on every major Sunday morning talk show, Fauci preached the importance of practicing social distancing for containing the spread of coronavirus cases, which have exploded in the U.S. in recent weeks as well as other hot spots all over the globe, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.  He and other health officials have pleaded for people to hunker down in an attempt to blunt the spread and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. When asked about crowds still heading to restaurants and bars over the weekend, Fauci said that there was serious room for improvement. “I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars,” he said. “Whatever it takes to do that, that's what I would like to see.”  Some local governments and businesses have stepped up to attempt to force social separation, banning mass gatherings and slashing business hours. The issue was unavoidable over the weekend for scores of travelers who tried to rush back to the U.S. in the wake of a new travel ban by the administration, crowding airports across the country, which Fauci called “unfortunate” and “not what you like to see.”  But where social interaction is able to be avoided, Fauci said that sacrifices in people’s lifestyles are imperative to heading off a crisis the likes of which countries like Italy are grappling with. “Certainly it is conceivable that if we don't do that you could get as bad as Italy,” he warned. “But I don't think we're going there, if we do the kind of things that we're publicly saying we need to do. We need to be very serious about, for a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States. We have to just accept that if we want to do what's best for the American public.” ",'Everybody's got to take this seriously': Fauci warns against coronavirus indifference among young people ,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-young-people-130229,politico

But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin said, arguing the current market rout has disparate origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus isn't comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus."" Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment is the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill Congress approved earlier this month, and it would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and, as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small- and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship — there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how big of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushing back on the idea that relief measures under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2008 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, there are no such issues contributing to the market tumble, Mnuchin argued. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, via Sophocles to Albert Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran, to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad, and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. The Plague is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, in which plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only 5 at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from divine will and the rise of con men to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene in which blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short lived and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague epidemic of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extramarital liaisons who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, The Betrothed gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. The Last Man by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakened Athens in its war with Sparta and claimed the life of the city’s great statesman, Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparked a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey, tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to to kill themselves in bizarre ways. The race is on for scientists from the Wildfire task force to contain the alien micro-organism and understand why two very unlikely people appear to be immune.

"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination and staying in the race just to try to persuade Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential questions in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before but only after nomination by this party.” He called President Dwight D. Eisenhower the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisers, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most importantly, when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed on to platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on civil rights. On that issue, the compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for Dreamers—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for undocumented immigrants. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of Sanders supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: When and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, Delaware, not Burlington, Vermont.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac Corp., the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. But Fair Isaac, also known as FICO, confirmed the existence of the probe Sunday, saying it focuses on “potential exclusionary conduct."" “FICO intends to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice and looks forward to a constructive dialogue about the state of competition in our industry,” the company said in a statement. “FICO is confident the Department will conclude that it has not engaged in any exclusionary conduct.” The company noted that it is also involved in an antitrust suit brought by credit reporting agency TransUnion, which that company filed after Fair Isaac sued it for unpaid royalties. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by TransUnion and the other two large credit reporting agencies, Experian and Equifax. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump's favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of ""Fox & Friends"" scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  ""To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,"" co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump's administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus' rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature ""curvy couch"" of the ""Fox & Friends"" set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored ""the big plastic desk"" one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio's ""fish bowl area."" ""We're doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don't want to get infected and you don't want to spread infection,"" Doocy said. ""We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,"" Earhardt added. ""And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.""  The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. The on-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was ""actually the safest time to fly"" despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of ""overreacting"" to the coronavirus. ""It makes you wonder if there's a political reason for that,"" Falwell said. ""You know, impeachment didn't work, and the Mueller report didn't work, and Article 25 didn't work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.""",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico

"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and less than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  The president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower among those surveyed than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, by a margin of 49-44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus’ threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy” in the coronavirus.  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding group gatherings of more than 10 people, working or attending school from home whenever possible, and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico

"There’s an easy way to tell that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a bad deal on the bipartisan coronavirus response bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. It’s not the liberal complaints that she let the White House limit paid sick leave to about one-fifth of U.S. workers. It’s not the Republican complaints that the bill doesn’t provide tax relief and cash for businesses and individuals hurt by the pandemic. It’s not even the general consensus that this initial legislation will need to be followed up by a much more aggressive economic stimulus bill. No, the easy way to tell Pelosi negotiated a bad deal for Democrats is that she negotiated a deal at all—rather than dictating the terms and telling President Donald Trump to take them or leave them. The lesson of the last congressional response to an economic emergency, President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill, is that when a president desperately needs legislation to address a crisis, anyone with the power to stop him can decide what’s in it. When Obama took office, in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Democrats controlled the House and Senate as well. But they needed 60 votes to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and there were only 57 Democratic senators, which meant Obama had to recruit three Republicans to vote for a stimulus bill. In just his second week in office, his blunt-spoken chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had to pose a blunt-spoken question to Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania: Whaddya want? Specter’s ask was simple, and by Washington horse-trading standards, noble. He wanted $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Then he would vote for the Obama stimulus. “Are you f---ing kidding me?” Emanuel exploded. Emanuel assumed $10 billion-with-a-b was just Specter’s initial bid, a shock-tactic negotiating ploy. But Specter gruffly said no, that was his final offer, take it or leave it. “What the f--- does a vote cost around here?” Emanuel screamed. In Specter’s case, it cost precisely $10 billion. He understood that Obama needed his vote to fix the economy, so he held all the leverage. But today’s congressional Democrats don’t seem to understand that at all. Right now, after initially downplaying the threat of coronavirus, then bungling the response to the pandemic, then watching the swift demise of the bull market he had hailed as proof of his leadership, Trump absolutely needs congressional action to limit the public health disaster and mitigate the economic damage on his watch. House Democrats can pass whatever bill they want, and if Republicans aren’t willing to go along with it, another lesson of American crisis politics is that it’s Trump who will suffer the consequences. Some Democrats have fretted that they might suffer politically if they don’t help Trump clean up the mess, but the opposite happened in 2009. The Republican minority in the House unanimously refused to support Obama’s stimulus, even though the crisis had exploded on his Republican predecessor’s watch, and the very next year those same Republicans took back the majority in the House. In fact, the only Republican in Congress who paid a political price was Specter, who had to switch to the Democratic Party after a GOP backlash over his vote for Obama’s stimulus, and ended up losing his seat anyway. In 2020, Democrats are not acting like a party with that kind of leverage. Instead, Pelosi frantically hashed out a compromise on Friday over 13 phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accepted Democratic proposals to expand free COVID-19 testing and unemployment benefits, along with a modest boost in food aid for the poor, but made it clear that permanent legislation mandating universal sick leave was a “non-starter” for Republicans. Trump ratcheted up the pressure by complaining publicly that Democrats weren’t “giving enough” in the negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the House proposals as “an ideological wish list.” Ultimately, Democrats accepted a temporary mandate that only applies to companies smaller than 500 employees, and allows companies smaller than 50 employees to seek exemptions.  “Democrats preferred to have something rather than nothing,” a Democratic source explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That was the choice we faced.” That was not the choice Democrats faced. Unlike the Republicans in 2009, who only had a filibuster-proof minority in the Senate, they also have a majority in the House, where they could have attached anything they wanted to the must-pass coronavirus testing and dared Republicans to say no.  If the president was unwilling to approve measures to help contain a pandemic and limit the economic fallout because he didn’t want sick workers to be guaranteed paid leave, he could have explained that to the public. He’s the president, the head of state, the “I alone can fix it” guy. He’s the one who will be judged by the outcome of the crisis that he initially insisted was not a crisis, then declared was under control thanks to his leadership. After all, Obama was held responsible for an economic crisis that erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, and the party that fought his efforts to fix the crisis ended up taking back the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. The public doesn’t follow the details of legislation on Capitol Hill, but it blames presidents for bad outcomes. The public also tends to blame presidents for partisan paralysis, while giving them credit for bipartisan cooperation; that’s why McConnell understood he could make Obama look partisan by fighting him, even though Obama’s stimulus was stuffed with tax cuts and other Republican priorities. It is true that Democrats would be accused of trying to exploit the crisis if they tried to load up a coronavirus bill with unrelated priorities such as, say, a Green New Deal to fight the climate crisis—although it’s worth noting that Trump and McConnell have already accused them of trying to exploit the crisis just for trying to mandate sick leave during a pandemic. But they still have the leverage to shape legislation just about any way they want if they’re willing to take the heat. In 2009, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine used her leverage to demand that the Obama stimulus include a technical fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax that added $70 billion to the price tag while providing virtually no economic stimulus. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine insisted on stripping a school construction initiative out of Obama’s stimulus—along with, ironically, an $870 million line item for pandemic preparedness. The 57 Democrats in the Senate also had the power to extract concessions for their votes; Obama had wanted a stimulus without congressional earmarks, but Dick Durbin of Illinois managed to include one for a $1 billion carbon-capture plant that never ended up getting built. Setting aside the question of whether Democrats should try to exploit the leverage to advance long-term policy priorities, they can absolutely exploit their leverage to address the short-term crisis. If they think universal sick leave will help, they should demand universal sick leave. Meanwhile, with Louisiana and Georgia already postponing primaries over the virus, why shouldn’t Democrats attach provisions guaranteeing that Americans will be able to vote by mail in November? Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, doesn’t understand why the Democrats didn’t insist on provisions restoring congressional oversight powers to help them ride herd on the administration’s response to the virus, ensuring that Trump and his aides can no longer defy subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Again, if Trump thinks it’s so important to prevent Americans from voting by mail and preventing Congress from overseeing his administration that he would block measures to accelerate the pandemic testing that his own team has botched, he can try to convince the public. “House Democrats don’t have some leverage,” Hauser says. “They have complete leverage.” By giving Trump the emergency measures that he needs most without insisting on the worker protections that Democrats wanted most, Pelosi has sacrificed some of that leverage. She has also helped the president look like a bipartisan consensus-builder, while essentially confirming the GOP talking point that Democrats have a responsibility to meet Trump’s demands in order to avoid a partisan stalemate. In 2009, Republicans simply ignored all the pundits warning that they would pay a huge political price for refusing to help the first black president fix an economic mess he had inherited—and the pundits turned out to be wrong. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders argue that it’s their duty to help Trump save lives and jobs in 2020, even though Republicans didn’t help Obama in 2009, even though Trump routinely calls them traitors, even though an economic downturn could doom his reelection. They’re pro-government people; they’re not inclined to stand in the way of government action during a crisis. When the Great Recession was just getting started in January 2008, Pelosi negotiated a quick bipartisan stimulus bill with Bush’s Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, and within months Americans were receiving $1000 checks from the federal government. It’s an honorable approach, even though it also probably reduces Pelosi’s leverage. It’s hard to win a game of chicken when the other driver knows you’re committed to avoiding a crash. Once Trump signs this emergency response bill, he’ll start clamoring for a much larger economic stimulus bill loaded with tax cuts for airlines, cruise lines, his own hospitality industry and other Republican-friendly businesses, along with payroll tax cuts that can help get him reelected. And Democrats will find that many of the same Republicans who mocked the idea of using taxpayer dollars to stimulate the private economy as big government when Obama was in the White House—even though they had supported that bipartisan stimulus bill under Bush—will rediscover the attraction of Keynesian economics when it suits their party’s interests. Democrats will have to decide whether to meet Trump in the middle, or whether to risk the obstructionist label by holding out for what they want in a time of economic pain. They will also have to decide exactly what it is they want. Some of Obama’s top economists have publicly called for Congress to send checks to American citizens, which would help the economy and also Trump’s reelection prospects. Again, that’s honorable and responsible, especially since Trump is sure to denounce the Democrats as obstructionists no matter what happens, but it’s not clear it squares with Democratic rhetoric about the danger of Trump’s reelection, especially if they don’t get anything in exchange for helping to rescue the sinking Trump economy. In any case, Trump won’t be able to pass a stimulus bill without them. At a minimum, one thing they can demand for their cooperation is legislative assurance that economic stimulus can no longer be something that only happens routinely under Republican presidents. They should insist on more robust “automatic stabilizers” so that any time the economy craters, no matter who’s in the White House, Washington will automatically spend far more on food stamps, unemployment insurance and other aid to vulnerable families, and perhaps automatically roll back payroll taxes and other economic burdens. That way, members of Congress will no longer have the power to take the economy hostage during crises. For now, though, Democrats absolutely have that power. They need to choose their ransom wisely.",Pelosi Has Trump Over a Barrel,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-stimulus-132388,politico
"Much of American public life is at a standstill. But not the Democratic presidential race — not yet at least. While some future voting has been postponed due to the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus across the U.S., primaries in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois are still on for Tuesday. Polling places in Ohio, which was set to vote Tuesday, have been closed down by public health officials after the governor pushed to delay the primary amid the public health crisis. Despite that, think of the vote as Super Tuesday, Jr.: The 441 delegates up for grabs in the three states still voting today makes it the third-largest delegate haul on the calendar, behind only March 3 and the slate of primaries planned for April 28. But between the coronavirus beginning to ravage the nation, the unprecedented, widespread closures that have shuttered public spaces across the country and Joe Biden’s now-commanding lead over Bernie Sanders — in polls released on the eve of the March 17 contests, Biden holds double-digit leads across all four states — the primaries are flying below the radar for many Americans. Last week, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio rejected calls to postpone Tuesday’s primaries, saying that they would make accommodations, including extending early-voting hours, to prevent large crowds from gathering. But on Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a court in Columbus for a last-minute postponement of the primary. When the court refused, saying it was too late to postpone, the state’s health department ordered the polling places shuttered — despite a lack of clarity about how, or even if, voters might be able to cast ballots in the primary. The Ohio Supreme Court later effectively upheld the decision to close the polls. Here’s a state-by-state look at the map for Tuesday: Democrats are hoping that Tuesday’s presidential primary is the springboard to flipping Arizona in November. President Donald Trump won the state by just 4 points in 2016, and polls conducted there show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both competitive against Trump in the general election. Arizona will likely be the closest of the four states voting on Tuesday, according to pre-election polls. But Biden still holds a double-digit lead over Sanders in poll after poll — despite Sanders’ enduring, though not overwhelming, advantage among Latino voters. Clinton defeated Sanders in Arizona four years ago. 56 percent to 41 percent, and carried all nine of the state’s congressional districts. Polls suggest Biden is on pace for a similar victory, barring a surprise. The state is going ahead with its primary despite the coronavirus outbreak. Many voters cast their ballots by mail, but there is still significant disruption. In Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix and is home to roughly 60 percent of registered voters — most polling places are closed for safety reasons. Instead, the county is operating about 150 vote centers on Tuesday, where voters can cast their ballots regardless of where they live within the county. Bernie Sanders was blown out by Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 — and his prospects are no more promising in 2020. Polls show Joe Biden with a two- or three-to-one advantage over Sanders, whose lack of support from older Democrats makes him particularly ill-suited for a state that is a magnet for retirees from the eastern third of the nation. Moreover, Sanders’ advantage with Latino voters in other states doesn’t translate to Florida, where many Hispanics are either immigrants or descend from immigrants from Caribbean and Latin American countries whose leftist leaders they despise. Polls show Sanders, who has praised some of the actions of those authoritarian governments, trailing Biden among Hispanic voters in Florida. The state has shuttered and consolidated a number of polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak. The state Democratic Party on Monday identified 91 precincts that were closed after GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered elections officials not to house polling places in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. But DeSantis resisted calls to reschedule the presidential primaries. “We’re definitely voting,” he told reporters in Tallahassee last Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Polls close in virtually all of Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern — but remain open an hour later in portions of the Panhandle in the Central Time Zone. Bernie Sanders had the Democratic establishment on edge four years ago when he stormed out of Michigan victorious and nearly beat Hillary Clinton in her home state of Illinois a week later. But in 2020, neighboring Michigan delivered a 16-point rout for Biden and has deflated the Vermont senator’s campaign here. Mike Bloomberg had started to make inroads here but when he, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar folded their campaigns, most of their moderate supporters — and their donors — joined the Biden camp. Gov. J.B. Pritzker also delivered his endorsement to Biden on primary eve. A WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last week showed Biden leading Sanders by 20 percentage points among likely voters in Illinois. Sanders recently rallied in Chicago with Rep. Chuy Garcia and other local Latino officials to help shore up his support. But the cloud hanging over the Tuesday primary is the coronavirus outbreak. Schools have been ordered closed and polling stations are being moved out of senior centers as the number of cases tick up, so it’s unclear what voter turnout will look like. The saga of Ohio’s primary adds significant uncertainty to a race that otherwise seems one-sided. Biden led Sanders in the latest poll by 23 points — in a state Clinton carried by 13 points four years ago, winning all but 15 of the state’s 88 counties. Gov. Mike DeWine’s Monday night order closing the polling places came only about eight hours before they were set to open. DeWine said Secretary of State Frank LaRose would petition the courts “to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.” But it’s unclear how that opportunity would be extended, or when. The ambiguity extends beyond the presidential race. Ohio was set to hold all its primaries for the 2020 elections on Tuesday, including for Congress and state legislature.",How to watch Tuesday’s primaries like a pro,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-to-watch-tuesdays-primaries-133318,politico
"Bernie Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination is closing, but a quick exit is far from guaranteed — even if he gets wiped out Tuesday. From his debate posture to staffing moves to the “virtual rally” he convened Monday evening, the Vermont senator is signaling that he may not be ready to concede.  If Sanders remains in the race, it will be in part to keep his “political revolution” alive. According to people familiar with his thinking, Sanders will not only consider what’s best for his campaign, but also the progressive movement. Many of Sanders’ aides and allies also expect him to press onward after Tuesday. They see a benefit in amassing as many delegates as possible in order to influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention this summer — even if Sanders himself can’t win the nomination. “I think there’s a very good chance that he will stay in,” said Larry Cohen, chair of Our Revolution, a group founded by Sanders in 2016. “The number of delegates you have, the number of people on the platform committee is absolutely critical.” Notably, Sanders has staff in place for states that vote as late as April 28, according to a campaign adviser, including New York. Sanders’ aides have long thought that he would have a good shot in the Empire State, which is rich in delegates. Earlier this month, Sanders’ team announced it was opening five offices in Pennsylvania, a state seen by many local and state officials as Joe Biden’s second home. A former aide close to the Sanders campaign said that a senior staffer argued as recently as last week that there is still a path to victory even if Sanders suffers major losses Tuesday. “I think he’s in. Who is going to advise him to drop out?” the person said, adding that current aides can “work for whatever group Bernie starts next.” At Sunday’s debate, Sanders not only tried to push Biden’s agenda to the left, but also litigated his past votes extensively. When the former vice president offered him an olive branch by adopting a plan to make college free for families earning less than $125,000 annually, Sanders said it didn’t go far enough. “What I know about Sen. Sanders’ thought process and focus is, it’s all about representing the movement and leading what he initially called the political revolution,” said Kurt Ehrenberg, Sanders’ longtime political strategist in New Hampshire until last year. “And not letting down the people who have been with him all along. I think that’s the most important consideration for him.” The fact that states are postponing their primaries to combat the coronavirus outbreak could provide Sanders more incentive to stay in the race. Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, which had previously been scheduled to vote in March, April and May, respectively, have rescheduled their primaries. Party officials in Puerto Rico are in the process of requesting a delay.  If Puerto Rico reschedules its March 29 primary, it will be more than two weeks until the next regularly scheduled primaries.  At the same time, the pandemic and looming possibility of a recession — or even a full-fledged depression — could make it more likely that Sanders stays in because the stakes are so high. “In these very uncertain times, we need a president who is going to put the interests of everyday people over every other consideration — and that’s Bernie Sanders,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser. “How do we know that? Because that’s been his consistent life’s work.” If Sanders continues his bid after Tuesday, he will face an onslaught of pressure from establishment Democrats and even some progressives to drop out. Many are wary of a long, divisive primary after 2016, and eager to take on President Donald Trump with the benefit of a united party. Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement helped fuel Biden’s comeback victory in South Carolina, said on the day of the March 10 primaries that the Democratic National Committee should “shut this primary down” and cancel debates if the former vice president swept the races, which he went on to do. Sanders’ electoral prospects are bleak. Momentum — and the delegate count — have shifted to Biden, who looks poised to win another string of contests decisively on Tuesday. “I think it could be much, much more constructive if he gets out earlier,” said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders during his 2016 campaign. “He’s still going to have roughly 1,000 delegates going into the convention, and that’s all the leverage that you need to influence the platform.” But Sanders often doesn’t follow the unwritten rules of campaigning that other politicians abide by. When he had a heart attack last year — the kind of event that would force most candidates out of an election — he stayed in the race. He also declined to bow out of the 2016 primary even after it was mathematically impossible to win the nomination, instead successfully pushing for a more progressive party platform and major rule changes. And at the same time that Sanders faces pressure from mainstream Democrats to exit, many on the left are encouraging him to stay in. Some Sanders supporters still remember when Biden was badly down in the primary before South Carolina, and envision a turnaround for their own candidate. “My urging to the campaign has been, ‘We’ve got to play this out,’” said Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles city councilman and prominent Sanders ally. “We’ve got to play the whole game … I’m suggesting we don’t quit simply because now they’re up. Why should we?” Progressive activists see Sanders’ continued candidacy as significant to their movement, even if his chances narrow to almost impossible margins. Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the political action committee Democracy for America, said there is a “real question” about whether either Biden or Sanders can reach the delegate threshold necessary to secure the nomination outright and that the tumultuous nature of the race suggests Sanders should stay in. “I don’t think anyone can predict for sure what’s going to happen between now and the end of this primary contest,” he said. “There’s plenty of time, plenty of delegates left, and this game can change at any minute.” The Democratic Party, he said, “shouldn’t be about shutting it down” before more states vote. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to remain in the race through at least March. “Not only should Bernie stay in, but it would actively hurt Democrats’ chances against Trump if he got out prematurely,” he said. “Because especially during this crisis, we need to know that our candidate is tested and stands for bold ideas like paid sick leave, free universal health care and canceling student debt as the right way to put money into the economy.” At the same time, Sanders loathes Trump and considers Biden a friend, which will also likely factor into his decision of whether to continue his bid for the White House after Tuesday. One thing is certain: Only Sanders and his wife, Jane, who has played an instrumental role in his 2020 operation, know for sure if he will carry onward. “All of the important decisions come from Bernie and Jane, as they should,” said Ehrenberg.",‘Who is going to advise him to drop out?’: Bernie may not be ready for quick exit,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-sanders-not-going-quietly-132641,politico
"For the second time in two years, Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the last members of a dwindling breed of conservative House Democrats who oppose abortion rights — is at risk of losing his seat in a primary. The Illinois lawmaker faces a rematch Tuesday against Marie Newman, a progressive upstart who nearly unseated him in 2018. But what should have been the left’s clearest shot yet at the incumbent is mired in uncertainty, with high-profile progressives distracted by Sen. Bernie Sanders's floundering presidential campaign and the election itself enveloped by the coronavirus crisis. Both camps are at a loss for how to handicap the race. “I personally don’t know,” said Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster working with Lipinski. “You love to say you’re a guru about these things, but there’s too many things we don’t know the answer to.” Lipinski is liberals' highest-profile 2020 primary target. Lining up behind Newman are Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and the Justice Democrats.  Ousting him would be a much-needed victory for these progressives who have struggled to recapture the magic of 2018, including Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of a leading House Democrat, amid a series of roadblocks throughout the primary season. Their latest loss came on Super Tuesday, when Jessica Cisneros, a liberal challenger boosted by the Justice Democrats, failed to oust a moderate Democrat in South Texas. Other progressive Senate candidates also fell short in primaries in Texas and North Carolina. Lipinski's primary may have been their best chance for victory— before the coronavirus outbreak. Newman began March with clear momentum: She was outspending the incumbent on TV by a two-to-one margin, and Lipinski supporters were nervous enough that they had begun urging Republican-leaning voters to pull a Democratic ballot and cast it for the incumbent. The biggest question mark now is turnout. Both campaigns are operating under the assumption that it could be at a historic low, with leaders, including Illinois' governor, urging citizens to be cautious about venturing out into public spaces. Lipinski admitted in an interview last week he was combating a lot of unknowns. “We’ll see where the presidential primary is,” he told reporters in the Capitol. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, don’t know what the coronavirus — what impact that could have. So, just wait and see.” The Newman campaign has urged supporters to vote early, is prioritizing phone banking and canceled its election night party. Both teams could make a plausible case that low turnout is to their benefit, depending on the age and ideology of who shows up. Lipinski’s team thinks he could have an edge with older voters, who tend to be more reliable and may be more likely to go to the polls. Yet the coronavirus disproportionately affects those 60 and older and public health officials urged that demographic should remain in their homes as much as possible. Other liberal challengers, such Ocasio-Cortez, have won low-turnout races where the electorate is smaller and more ideological. The 2018 midterms brought roughly presidential-level primary turnout, and Newman came within 2,200 votes short of ousting Lipinski. Though a new policy by the House Democratic campaign arm that blacklists consultants who work with primary challengers cost her some top campaign talent, Newman said she feels better prepared this cycle. “As you can imagine, your first time out you learn a lot. And I did. And there’s things that I didn’t do well,"" she told reporters in a phone call last week.  Now ""we have an amazing voter outreach program,"" she said. ""I started fundraising a lot earlier this time.” Her campaign, she said, has knocked over 110,000 doors and made 90,000 phone calls. She had outraised Lipinski by more than $400,000 as of late February, and that contrast is particularly stark on television. Newman has funneled about $900,000 on television advertising, while Lipinski has dropped less than $450,000, according to an analysis obtained by POLITICO. Plus a coalition of pro-abortion-rights groups, including EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice and Planned Parenthood, have dropped about $1 million in TV ads knocking Lipinski. And outside allies who spent for Lipinski in 2018, such as the bipartisan group No Labels, have largely stayed out this cycle, leaving a stark disparity. “She’s got significantly more independent-expenditure resources than she had last time, and we have significantly less,” said Dave Heller, a media consultant for Lipinski, “which is the only reason why we’re worried.” Lipinski is reviled by the liberal wing of the party for a slew of positions and votes that range from defunding Planned Parenthood, to his 2010 opposition to the Affordable Care Act. (He is now notably running an ad touting his efforts to protect that law, attacking Newman for supporting a single-payer health care plan.) Still, Newman has centered her campaign more squarely around other issues like reducing gun violence and making health care affordable. She supports Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal. Lipinski has pitched himself as more in line with the district and suggests Newman is too extreme: ""We should remain focused on what’s important. What really holds us all together as Democrats: the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress."" Yet there’s evidence to suggest his allies are leaning on independent and Republican voters to boost him in the Democratic primary. An internal campaign strategy document accidentally leaked in November suggested “GOP surrogates” could help Lipinski court Republican voters. Then this weekend, a Newman volunteer received what appeared to be an automated text message mobilizing GOP-leaning voters to ""stop"" Newman and Cook County (Ill.) prosecutor Kim Foxx. Asked last week about the possibility of courting Republican voters — Illinois doesn't have party registration, so voters can pull whichever party's primary ballot they request — Lipinski said it was not the focus of his outreach but suggested he would take their support. “I think it’s good to have more people vote in the Democratic primary, bring them into the Democratic Party,” he said. Lipinski was first elected in 2004, after his father, then-Rep. Bill Lipinski, announced his surprise retirement and persuaded the state Democratic Party to nominate his son to replace him on that fall's ballot. The younger Lipinski could benefit from Chicago machine politics that boosted him and his father in the past. He will need to run up the margins in the Chicago part of the district, as he did two years ago, while Newman is banking on support in the southwest suburbs. A win by Newman on Tuesday would bring a surge of energy to progressives disheartened by a stinging loss earlier this month against Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who has also opposed abortion rights.  Cuellar and his fellow moderates have hailed his victory over Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, as an indicator that their caucus is still a big-tent party. “It bodes well for moderates and centrists,” said Cuellar, who said he had discussed his race with Lipinski. “A lot of members were very happy I won because they felt that, if I would have lost, then that would have created a momentum.” Sanders’ dismal performance in recent primaries has relieved some Lipinski supporters, who worried Sanders could drive out young and more left-leaning voters out to the polls, and that they would be more likely to support Newman. Interviewed last week at the Capitol as the House scrambled to cobble together a program to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, some top progressives suggested they had not been closely monitoring Lipinksi’s race or were otherwise preoccupied. ""Obviously, I’ve been very busy with the Sanders campaign,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a top Sanders surrogate. “But I’m supportive of her; we did some fundraising for her.” “I don’t know any of the day-to-day detail stuff,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Newman, when asked if he was following the race. The scaling back of large gatherings precluded any kind of final-weekend rally with big-name headliners like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez — though it’s not clear if any would have materialized without the outbreak. Neither campaigned for Cisneros in South Texas. “I was always a little bit worried about this dynamic,” said Sean McElwee, the founder of a liberal think tank. “The extent to which the top of the ticket was going to swamp out interest in the down-ticket stuff was always a danger for these primary challengers this cycle.”","This anti-abortion rights, Obamacare-opposing House Democrat is in trouble",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/dan-lipinski-primary-133226,politico

"The return of the snowbird is a sign of spring in Canada — though this year, those returning from states with coronavirus cases are causing concern rather than celebration. Hundreds of thousands of retired Canadians spend their winters in warm American climes, timing their return with the melt of the snow back home. Heightened concerns about the rapid spread of COVID-19 are prompting Canadian officials to openly question whether the travelers may bring home more than memories and souvenirs. It's unclear if border agents are prepared to manage their arrival or if the travelers know about the self-quarantine precautions they’re supposed to take when they get to Canada.  Many of those “snowbirds” live part of the year in Florida, which has seen a stark increase in the number of diagnoses and at least 141 positive cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that’s spread across the globe. Those retirees are among the most vulnerable populations affected by the upper respiratory disease. With rising concern about the outbreak, politicians and health officials are wondering aloud how they'll handle the influx as cases of the virus continue to rise in the country. Ontario Chief Medical Officer David Williams said Monday that the province was “trying to get some direction from the federal government” on how to manage the snowbirds' return. “We’re seeing a number of Ontarians at least coming back in ever-increasing numbers,” he said. “Unfortunately, a number of them, after a few days, have been found to be positive from different parts of the USA.” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Sunday he's instructed the province's tourism arm to redirect advertising toward Canadians, including snowbirds, to inform them of the new protocols upon arrival in the country from abroad. Just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was appealing for Canadians abroad to return home as soon as possible, many of these older citizens were notified by their medical insurers that their coverage for COVID-19 will expire in the next week if they remain away. Trudeau said Monday that anyone showing symptoms associated with the illness won't be permitted to board flights to Canada beginning Wednesday, adding another potential complication to anyone trying to leave the U.S. Evan Rachkovsky, a spokesperson for the Canadian Snowbird Association, said his group has emailed more than 100,000 members with up-to-date information on Canadian government recommendations, including that they will be expected to self-isolate upon return. “We are doing everything that we can do to flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus,” Rachkovsky said when asked how members were receiving the instructions, adding that the group has been providing the details about self-isolation for more than a week. “The response has been positive in the sense that ... they’re obviously being cautious, and they want to return home as quickly as possible,” he said. He did not have information on whether any members have tested positive for the virus. The Canada Border Services Agency announced new coronavirus screening questions Monday after being criticized for an apparently haphazard approach to evaluating inbound travelers for possible symptoms and to advising them on the strongly encouraged 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said every Canadian returning home — including snowbirds arriving by car — will receive information telling them to self-isolate. “People who ... maybe spent the winter down in Florida or in Arizona, many of them will be driving back,” he said Monday. “That same information will be provided to them as they cross into Canada ensuring that they understand the need to self-isolate for 14 days.” Florida and Arizona are the most popular states among snowbirds, Rachkovsky said. St. Petersburg and Clearwater boast “several thousand” Canadians come wintertime, and many also flock to the Phoenix and Mesa areas of Arizona, he said. It’s difficult to estimate how many snowbirds will return to Canada in the coming days, Rachkovsky said. “But you’re definitely dealing with hundreds of thousands of people"" who are being asked to leave as quickly as possible, he added.",Return of Canada's 'snowbirds' raises COVID-19 concerns,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/canada-snowbird-coronavirus-133062,politico
"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Cafecito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico
"The voice of the woman, introducing herself as “Elisabeth … you know, Poldi’s mom,” sounded genuinely concerned. A friend of hers, who was a doctor at the university hospital of Vienna, had called her with a warning, she said in German. The clinic had noticed that most patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus pandemic, had taken the painkiller ibuprofen before they were hospitalized. Tests run by the university’s laboratory, she added, had found “strong evidence that ibuprofen accelerates the multiplication of the virus.” With lightning speed, an audio recording of the message spread among German-language users of WhatsApp, the messenger service owned by Facebook. Quickly, similar recordings referring to alleged research from Vienna in other languages like Slovak also began circulating on the service. But the WhatsApp message was based on fake information. “Nonsense,” said Johannes Angerer, a spokesperson for the Medical University of Vienna. “We neither discussed this internally, nor do we conduct any research into the potential effects of ibuprofen on COVID-19.” While there have been warnings against the use of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen to treat coronavirus-like symptoms, including by France’s health minister, everything the voice recording said about research efforts at the medical school had been made up, he stressed. The university released statements to flag the messages as fake within hours after first hearing about them Saturday morning. But the proverbial horse had bolted: German-language Google searches for the keywords “ibuprofen” and “Corona” spiked on Saturday around noon, according to data from the search giant. Over the weekend, the university’s website collapsed temporarily. The case provides an example of how, as the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, a wildfire of false and unverified information about the pandemic is following in its wake. On private messaging services like WhatsApp, well-intentioned but fearful individuals are forwarding messages with misleading or doctored information. Other cases range from warnings over made-up extraordinary measures governments might take to keep people in their homes to false numbers of deaths and the level of preparedness of medical services. “We are aware of an increasing number of false information about the COVID-19 outbreak appearing in public discourse, including on social media,” European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová, whose portfolio includes the EU’s efforts to fight fake news, told POLITICO in an email. But she also acknowledged that “we need to understand better the risks related to communication on end-to-end encryption services.” The Vienna fake is far from an isolated case of such digital misinformation — and others often follow a similar pattern that involves people claiming to share insider information with friends and family that they’ve gained access to. Among Belgian WhatsApp users, an audio message has been circulating with a woman claiming the hospital she worked in had triggered “the maximum pandemic plan.” Other voice recordings warned people of a complete lockdown of the country and urged them to stock up on food. Poland was hit by a wave of rumors about the government introducing zoning to cities and cutting off transportation to Warsaw. One audio message, recorded by a man who claimed he had a journalist friend with close ties to political decision-makers, said that as of last Sunday, the president would introduce an “emergency state” and that people wouldn’t be able to leave their houses for three weeks. In France, users forwarded an audio message of a woman who said that she has “a very very very well placed uncle” with ties to national ministers from whom she got information that the whole country would soon be in full quarantine. And in Portugal, a widely circulated voice message suggested that information on the number of infected people in the country was downplayed by official sources, with a man saying: “Forget the numbers the television is talking about. There are thousands of infected in Portugal, confirmed.” In Ireland, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar pleaded with people on Twitter: “I am urging everyone to please stop sharing unverified info on What’sApp groups. These messages are scaring and confusing people and causing real damage.” Jourová, who is drafting new proposals on how to protect EU democracies from misinformation, warned that her office was “concerned that some [false claims] can lead to public harm, such as false claims that drinking bleach cures the virus, or abuse the situation for material gain.” Her office is “is in regular contact with online platforms” to address the issue, she added. Experts have warned that, as Facebook has clamped down on misinformation on its main platform, its messenger service WhatsApp, which was bought in 2014, is increasingly becoming a key arena for the spread of misinformation. The social networking giant has invested millions of euros to clamp down on falsehoods on its main network, so people have turned to WhatsApp because it is less regulated and allows people to share personal messages with large numbers of people. In a statement, the company said that it is “committed to doing our part to tackle viral messages,” among other things by “reducing the number of people you can forward a message to.” In recent years, Facebook has limited the ability of people to forward WhatsApp messages in an attempt to stop misinformation from spreading like wildfire, and has teamed up with governments to help them share official announcements on the platform. “We encourage all users to check the facts online before sharing messages that have been forwarded to them, and we encourage users to engage directly with trusted and official sources for important information,” a company spokesperson added. Still, the rise of WhatsApp represents the latest turn in the cat-and-mouse game between those spreading misinformation — often people who are doing so unwittingly — and the global platform’s ability to thwart such activities. For Claire Wardle, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who has tracked WhatsApp’s role in spreading falsehoods, the platform allows people to share personal details — something many are eager to do in a time of crisis. “So much of this is about emotion, and audio is an emotive medium,” she said. “That phenomenon, which dates back to what we saw in India, is finally coming to Western Europe. People are turning to WhatsApp because they have more to say, and they want to speak directly to their friends and family.”", The coronavirus fake news pandemic sweeping WhatsApp,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-fake-news-pandemic-133447,politico
"Before markets started spiraling like 1987’s “Black Monday” crash, and even before President Donald Trump heard from state governors and G-7 leaders trying to stave off deaths at home, the president received a series of fresh warnings about the scale of the calamity poised to wash over America.  His coronavirus task force presented new information based on overseas models showing how quickly the virus could spread without swift action. And new data he was shown from China overnight highlighted that country’s economic collapse — plunging factory activity and soaring unemployment — despite its draconian measures to combat the coronavirus crisis.  Faced with a reality that the nation he oversees needs to take dramatic action or follow in the footsteps of deeply troubled nations abroad, the president took on a newly somber tone about a virus outbreak he spent months downplaying.  “I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing,” Trump quipped as he stepped up to the lectern in an unscheduled appearance at the sparsely populated James S. Brady briefing room in the White House, where reporters were arranged with open seats between them. It was a short moment of levity for Trump before he laid out dramatic new guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the virus and saving lives. He instructed people to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, stay home from work or school if possible, avoid travel and nursing homes.  In just 24 hours, the president went from telling people filling up their pantries to just “relax,” to acknowledging the economy might be careening toward a recession and warning the public they have a narrow window of 15 days to stop the spread of a lethal disease. “It’s bad. It’s bad,” Trump said. “But we’re going to be hopefully a best case, not a worst case. And that’s what we’re working for.” It was a dramatic change in tone from his Oval Office address, which was riddled with mistakes; his Rose Garden news conference, where he went against expert recommendations and shook hands with everyone in sight; and his Sunday appearance with the vice president, when he rattled off a list of CEOs he talked to on the phone only to turn on his heels without taking questions. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play,” Trump said Monday, flanked by members of his task force. “If everyone makes these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus.” The shift represented a new understanding by the White House of the risk that the U.S. could soon be overwhelmed by a disease explosion.  “Look, we could have a spike in these cases or we could blunt the curve,” national security adviser Robert O’Brien told POLITICO. “And if we can blunt the curve we can end up with a situation where our health care system can handle the crisis. We don’t want a spike the way we’ve seen in Italy.” The president, who just one day before said the virus would quickly pass, said Americans should brace for the coronavirus to affect daily lives as late as July or August. And he appeared disturbed to hear that some of his closest allies, like GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, had bucked the advice of the health professionals standing at his side by encouraging people to go to restaurants. “Well, I would disagree with it,” Trump said. “It's adverse to what the professionals are saying.” Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer called it a “striking difference.”  “This was sobering, serious, realistic and modest. This is what the doctor ordered,” Fleischer said. The 180-degree turn came after Trump was urged by allies privately and publicly to do more as the crisis careened out of control.  Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an outside adviser to Trump, penned an op-ed in The New York Times on Monday that didn’t criticize the president but did push him to act more aggressively by directing governors to close all schools and prohibit attendance at public facilities, including restaurants and bars, until at least May 11, among other suggestions.  “More must be done to prepare for increasing case numbers and to effectively communicate what must be done to reduce the threat,” he wrote. “I fear Americans are not yet taking this virus seriously enough.” And Newt Gingrich, another ally of the president, whose wife is the ambassador to the Holy See in Vatican City, wrote a chilling first-person account of what he saw in Italy.  “Faced with a pandemic threat, history teaches us it is far better to be overprepared than underprepared,” Gingrich wrote in Newsweek. “The lesson of Italy is that the sooner you act, the fewer lives you will lose and the less damage you will do to your economy.” On Sunday, the president hoped that the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its target interest rate to near zero would help blunt the market’s nosedive and for once lavished praise on an institution he regularly lambastes on Twitter. “That makes me very happy,” he said in a news conference.  But a former adviser said Trump realized Monday when the financial markets continued to fall that he had to do more. “The Fed obviously didn’t help” calm the waters, the person said. Trump was also deeply alarmed by the economic collapse in China that became apparent early Monday, according to two people close to the White House. Data released late Sunday showed a 13.5 percent decline in China’s industrial output in January and February from a year earlier, as well as a dramatic spike in unemployment. The country has also experienced a widespread suspension of manufacturing since the coronavirus outbreak began in China’s Hubei province in December.  “The president understands numbers and they were explaining to him some of the China economic numbers over the weekend and now he knows what’s coming here,” said one person close to Trump, adding that the drop in manufacturing truly startled the president. “This is a communist country that sealed off everyone in their apartments and is still seeing those numbers, so it made him realize there’s no way for the U.S. not to suffer those consequences and what he needs to do is whatever he can to get us through this as quickly as possible,” the person added.  News of China’s economic free fall came just days after the president and his team boasted about gains in U.S. markets following his declaration of a national emergency — during the Rose Garden ceremony last Friday at which Trump surrounded himself with corporate executives.  Up until Saturday, officials inside the White House Office of Legislative Affairs were “trying to project as much confidence” as possible in their conversations with the president, a tone that began to shift Sunday morning as more governors implemented lockdowns on non-essential businesses and ordered their residents to avoid gatherings of 50 people or more.  “It’s smart what he’s done. He’s made a decision to downplay expectations,” said a second person close to the White House after watching Trump’s appearance at the White House briefing Monday afternoon. Another official noted that the new White House guidelines gave some governors political cover to call for curfews and closures that have been met with groans by some small businesses bearing the brunt of the new rules or eye-rolls from younger Americans who may be less susceptible to the physical damage of the virus.  “I think the media has to recognize why he was hired by the American people — he’s not going to be consoler-in-chief,” said Jason Miller, a senior adviser on Trump’s 2016 campaign and an unofficial adviser. “They want him to go and get it done. What he’s realized here from the markets to society … they react to big bold leadership.” Fleischer said the president was able this time to be “reassuring and realistic.” “When events are this big, this serious, and this scary, the president’s communications job is twofold: One, be reassuring. And two, be realistic. And those two reinforce each other. The more realistic a president is, the more a country will believe his reassurances.” Still, Trump didn’t let go of his old approach completely.  When asked by a reporter Monday to rate his response on a scale of 1 to 10, the president answered in Trumpian fashion: “I’d rate it a 10. I think we’ve done a great job.”",A chastened Trump presents a newly somber tone,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-133278,politico
"Even before Congress has finished work on a second stimulus bill to deal with the coronavirus crisis, senators from both parties and the White House are already talking about a third package, which will come with a price tag that runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  And few people, from President Donald Trump on down, are complaining about the cost — knowing the country faces a potentially unprecedented economic hit from the pandemic.  But perhaps the most shocking fact is that the normally slow-moving Senate could pass the “Phase 3” bill this week, according to several GOP senators.  Following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, acting budget chief Russ Vought, and White House legislative affairs Director Eric Ueland, Senate Republicans said the Trump administration will present them with proposals on Tuesday for the latest response to the economic calamity caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  GOP senators said Mnuchin wants to funnel money to small businesses hit by the crisis, perhaps tens of billions of dollars.  And the U.S. airline industry, which has taken a huge hit as passengers disappear, could also get some financial help from the federal government. While the administration doesn't want to call it a bailout, the airline industry has warned that some carriers may face a ""potential valley of death"" if action isn’t taken quickly. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other top Democrats will roll out their own $750 billion-plus package on Tuesday, and what Trump and Senate Republicans will propose may equal or top that.  “I’m not going to comment on the specific numbers right now. I’ll be talking to the Republicans at lunch tomorrow. But it’s a big number,” Mnuchin said after huddling with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans for more than an hour in the Capitol on Monday.  “And we’ll be looking for support for small and medium-sized businesses, we’ll be looking for support for certain industries that we’ve talked about that are particularly hard hit. I’ve talked about airlines, hotels, others. And we will be looking at a general stimulus.”  “The president has instructed his team to look very expansively at what we have to do, and not be impeded by the potential price tag for what’s necessary here,” Ueland added.  A multibillion-dollar measure crafted by Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi to provide some paid sick leave, expand free coronavirus testing, and boost food aid and unemployment insurance is expected to be taken up in the Senate as early as Tuesday. Congress already passed an $8.3 billion bill to combat the virus. Mnuchin is supposed to attend a Senate GOP luncheon on Tuesday and offer specific proposals for the next piece of congressional action.  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who attended the session with Mnuchin and other administration officials, said the Senate could move to a new rescue package as early as this week. In fact, Rubio said many senators made it clear they want to move ahead on that drastically accelerated timeline. “I don’t think we can assume that we can keep reconvening the Senate every week like we did this week. I don’t think we can make that assumption,” Rubio said. “With what might happen to airlines or travel schedules, with individual members having to go into quarantine or being exposed — I don’t think we can operate as if we can just bring the Senate and House back whenever we want.”  McConnell’s office wouldn’t comment on the possibility of passing the Phase 3 bill, although a Senate GOP aide noted, “The discussions are too premature to say at this point. But now that FISA is out of the way, it opens up more floor space for possible consideration.” Ueland also noted that Trump wants quick action as well.  “We can’t let weeks and months get under our feet here,” Ueland said. “Again, we have a real focus on urgent action, and I’m hopeful there could be swift consideration of consensus ideas as quickly as possible.”  Senators in both parties acknowledged they were concerned about the current government deficit, which was already projected to be more than $1 trillion before the coronavirus hit and derailed the economy.  But now, they point out that only the federal government can respond to this emergency with the financial power needed to address the present emergency.  “The reason having a massive deficit is a problem is that in a crisis, only the federal government can frankly provide support to state and local governments that have to balance their budgets,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).  Senate Democrats blamed the 2017 GOP tax cut — engineered by Mnuchin, McConnell and other Republican leaders — for the huge deficit, yet warned it shouldn’t matter now.  “We wouldn’t have that trillion-dollar deficit if we didn’t do a totally unnecessary tax cut,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). “But if we go into a recession or a depression, we’re talking trillions of dollars there.”  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a deficit hawk, said he would offer an amendment to cut spending from other programs for every dollar added in stimulus spending.  “I think that all spending should be offset by cutting less important spending, so I will offer an amendment to pay for it,” Paul said. “I think anytime we choose to spend money, no matter what the cause is, we should pay for it.”  Paul predicted such “pay for” amendments will be allowed because party leaders won’t want to get bogged down in a procedural fight that could disrupt quick action on the package.

"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the Washington primary, keeping a lead over fellow candidate and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the Associated Press. Washington was one of six states that voted last Tuesday — including Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota and Idaho — but was the last to have a winner declared Monday evening. Washington votes entirely by mail-in ballots.  Biden secured victories in all states except North Dakota, which went to Sanders. His Washington win continues a surge for the former vice president that initially started with a rocky trail behind Sanders.  Biden won by more than 21,000 of the over 2 million votes cast, according to the AP. Though 13 candidates were on the ballot, Biden and Sanders were the main candidates after a litany of prominent Democrats — including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — dropped out of the race. Sanders won the state's caucuses in 2016, beating out Hillary Clinton. Washington later had a non-binding primary that year that did not have an impact on the state's delegates, which Clinton won.

"As hospitals grapple with more coughing and feverish emergency-room visitors than they can test, the White House has deployed a SWAT team of fixers and technocrats to ramp up coronavirus testing, in an implicit acknowledgment that the Trump administration’s response has continued to fall short of what is needed. About 100 staffers and outside advisers, split between the health department and the White House, are currently working on teams to rapidly increase supplies of test kits and cope with shortages across the country, said four people with knowledge of the strategy. “This is the A-team of people who get shit done,” said one official, who’s worked with some of the staffers leading the effort. “We’ve got to show the American people that we can deliver on the testing promises” after weeks of President Donald Trump vowing that “anybody who needs a test can get a test” — a claim that doesn’t match the growing number of doctors, hospitals and patients who have said they’re still waiting for access and results. The lack of testing remains — despite Vice President Mike Pence’s assurance that drive-thru testing centers should be operative later this week — the greatest immediate danger to the U.S. response to the crisis, public health experts have warned. While Johns Hopkins University on Monday reported more than 4,287 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the United States, the true number could easily be more than 10 times higher at this point. That’s complicated medical professionals’ efforts to focus their resources and hurt public health officials’ effort to marshal a response. “We are far behind where we need to be,” tweeted Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, who changed his Twitter name to read ""Ashish 'We super duper need testing for COVID' Jha."" While the Harvard expert this weekend guessed that at least 40,000 people may be infected, ""we can't know without testing"" how big the problem is, he added. The SWAT-team effort is being overseen by Brett Giroir, the HHS official who was tapped as the nation’s testing coordinator on Friday, and Adam Boehler, a former HHS official who was drawn in to the coronavirus response last week. Brad Smith, a health-industry entrepreneur who only joined the administration in January, is serving as the operational leader. Outside experts in health care delivery and technology, like Flatiron Health CEO Nat Turner, also have been brought in as advisers. The officials have spent the past five days in round-the-clock war rooms and strategy sessions, gaming out ways to deploy drive-thru testing as Pence and Trump have promised this week. The initial testing centers will prioritize health workers and vulnerable populations, like people over 65, with a focus on the states that are hardest hit by the coronavirus. The new SWAT-team approach is similar to the emergency effort to repair HealthCare.gov in 2013, three officials said, although drew distinctions between the Obama-era recovery strategy — to fix the rollout of a long-scheduled website — and the frantic response to a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. “This shit hasn’t happened before,” said one senior administration official. “It’s not like we planned for coronavirus, and six months later we had a coronavirus.” Tapping officials like Giroir and Boehler, who have steered multiple administration priorities like President Donald Trump’s HIV/AIDS strategy and kidney-care overhaul, and a technocrat like Smith, is a tacit acknowledgment of management failures with the existing strategy, said two individuals, with the Trump administration cycling through multiple leaders and tactics — and officials trading blame for why testing has run so far behind. Much of the Trump administration’s initial strategy rested on coronavirus tests distributed by the Centers for Disease Control, which turned out to have manufacturing problems. CDC Director Robert Redfield has been widely faulted inside the administration for problems with his agency’s tests and miscommunicating to senior officials when replacement tests would be ready. HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who led the initial response, is frustrated with Redfield, said two people familiar with the situation, and dispatched Giroir earlier this month to the CDC to quietly investigate the problems within the agency, said three individuals briefed on the effort. The health secretary also elevated Giroir and another official, emergency-preparedness chief Robert Kadlec, to take over the department’s coronavirus response. Meanwhile, two officials blamed Azar himself for not doing more to coordinate the overall response across January and February, leaving the administration well short on the number of necessary tests. Some of the strategies taken in recent days, like working with private labs to ramp up tests, could have been pursued nearly two months ago under Azar’s leadership, the officials said. Vice President Mike Pence took over the response from Azar about three weeks ago, amid frustrations about the state of the effort and whether Azar's public health deputies had been too alarmist in their messages. But Pence has focused on coordinating the larger message and his office has lacked operational support to execute on specific initiatives, said two individuals. The new SWAT team is also a reflection of the growing involvement of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, in the administration's coronavirus response. Kushner is a longtime friend of Boehler, who led the Medicare innovation center until taking a new role as chief of U.S. international development finance chief last fall, and is viewed as an apolitical Silicon Valley veteran. Meanwhile, Smith is a Boehler ally who inherited his job at the Medicare innovation center before being pulled in to coordinate the SWAT team response. Asked about the shifting roles and responsibilities, an HHS spokesperson touted the decision to bring on more operational experts like Giroir. “The Trump Administration has activated a whole of government response to COVID-19 and all of our leaders bring highly valuable experience and expertise to this effort,” the spokesperson said. “The American people should know that the entire government is working around the clock to prepare for and protect against COVID-19.” The White House also defended the CDC’s role and response, despite problems with the agency’s tests that led to weeks of limited information about the spread of coronavirus. “CDC is doing what they could, given their tools and resources,” said Katie Miller, a spokesperson for Pence. “Given the increased demand, the administration is doing as much as to add additional capacity in an expedited manner.” The nation’s inadequate coronavirus testing has meant that the true scope of the problem is unknown. One doctor involved in the coronavirus response at a New York City-area hospital, who asked for confidentiality because the doctor did not have permission to speak to the media, said the facility has seen its coronavirus cases jump from just a handful of confirmed patients a week ago to more than a dozen as of Sunday, as more testing has come online. But the true scope of the outbreak still can't be measured, the doctor added, because patients who aren’t sick enough to be hospitalized aren’t getting tested, and the facility has been turning away dozens of less critically ill people who present with coronavirus symptoms, creating a “big gap” between official numbers and the disease’s likely spread. Crystal Lucas, a former state legislature candidate in Florida, told POLITICO that her 61-year-old mother-in-law went to the emergency room of Palms West Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla., on Friday with respiratory problems. Four hours later, she was admitted. “The nurse told us she hadn’t been tested because they didn’t have any test kits,” Lucas said. “She had an infectious disease doctor on her team when she was still in a regular hospital room. She was obviously suspected to have an infectious disease.” Palms West’s communications office did not respond to requests for comment. The patient, Vickie Schafer, is now in critical condition, Lucas said. She finally got a coronavirus test on Sunday evening and is awaiting the results. “Everything points to COVID and they treated it as if it wasn’t even on their radar,” said Lucas. “If we have this going on and this woman presents all the symptoms, why would we not act as if she is already positive?” If Schafer tests positive, it could indicate the virus has spread in Loxahatchee, the area of Palm Beach County where she lives. As of Monday evening, there were eight cases in the county, according to the state Department of Health’s website. In addition to worrying about her mother-in-law, Lucas said she worries about the doctors and nurses Schafer might have been exposed to the coronavirus between Friday and Sunday. And she worries about the patients those people might have come into contact with. Some hospital officials have said they would have developed their own coronavirus tests weeks ago but were told to stand down by officials at CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. “We were told two things,” said Alan Wells, medical director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s clinical laboratories. “One, that they were developing the testing and that CDC and states would be able to handle this. Two, that they were exercising authority to regulate which testing was approved.” Combined with other factors, including limited supplies, Wells’ team decided to shelve their potential coronavirus testing plan six weeks ago, but resumed work as the situation worsened and finally unveiled the tests on Saturday. Public health leaders, doctors and even Wall Street investors, are growing worried about the lack of transparency around the inadequate response. “Testing is getting there but with the virus doubling right now at minimum every seven days, each day of testing lost is a day that more people get sick,” Financial services firm Raymond James warned investors on Sunday night.

"TALLAHASSEE — Door knocking? Nope. Surrogate stops? Canceled. The bubbly? Corked. Even the candidates will be AWOL. Florida, a state famed for its weirdness, is preparing for one of its weirdest election days on Tuesday, when Democrats and Republicans will brave a pandemic to cast primary ballots for their presidential nominees. With two popular candidates on the ballot, Democrats were hoping to deliver a show of force against President Donald Trump with pumped-up turnout and lots of noise. Instead, they’ve had their mojo stolen by the coronavirus. Florida is a presidential election year crown jewel, a delegate-rich state that does double duty as the nation’s largest battleground. It’s expensive and difficult to flex institutional and infrastructure muscle in the state, which serves as a barometer of any campaign’s viability. Still, neither Joe Biden nor Bernie Sanders have campaigned here this year, and neither will be glad-handing Tuesday. Democratic get-out-the-vote operations are all but halted, and for the first time in memory there will be no Election Day parties. As the country hunkers down to avoid the coronavirus, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, on Monday made a push to postpone his state’s Tuesday primary, a plea a judge rejected late Monday. Illinois and Arizona, which also vote Tuesday, are at full speed. And in Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he’s not going to panic. “We’re definitely voting,” he said Saturday at a coronavirus briefing. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Besides, he said, most ballots probably have been cast in early voting already. And neither party’s primary, he noted, are going to be cliffhangers. Florida has a reputation for botched elections — from hanging chads in 2000 to a confusing recount in 2018 that led to the ouster of two South Florida election supervisors. This time around, polling places could present the biggest challenge. In an effort to protect elderly populations most at risk from the coronavirus, DeSantis has shut down voting sites at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Democrats are riled up. “We agree with the governor’s decision. We think it’s good policy to protect at-risk populations,” said Juan Peñalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party. “But there is no list of impacted voting locations. It’s information we want to help communicate to voters, but we were told by the governor’s office there is no list, and won’t be before Election Day.” So Peñalosa’s staff and volunteers are making their own list. They’ve reached out to all of the state’s 67 county election offices to find out where polling sites will be closed. “We are compiling a list and have already started communicating to impacted voters,” Peñalosa said. Then there’s the problem of staffing. Poll workers afraid of being exposed to the virus are dropping out. That’s on top of the election coinciding with spring break — many workers have begged off duty this year due to family obligations. Pasco County elections supervisor Brian Corley said he started “hemorrhaging” poll workers after a county resident tested positive for the coronavirus. “I can’t blame them,” Corley said. “A lot of them are senior citizens.” Corley said he’s lost 175 workers so far, and has turned to the local sheriff, schools and county government to find people to fill their spots. School resource officers from the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office will be among those reporting for duty on Tuesday, along with teachers and other county employees. “We can’t get to them fast enough,” Corley said. Still, election supervisors remain optimistic the day will go smoothly, in part because turnout won’t be that high. “We knew going in this was going to be challenging,” said Orange County Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles. And Corley said he’s doing the unthinkable — encouraging voters to not show up, especially if they’re sick or at risk. “If anyone is unsure, don’t go to the polls, as much as it pains me to say that,” Corley said. “Elections are wonderful, but this is a political party nominating contest.” Campaign operations also are improvising as the coronavirus creep sets in. Rather than emphasizing last-minute campaign and policy talking points, or feverishly ramping up their face-to-face ground game, campaigns are employing public-service-type announcements. Entire operations have gone virtual. Digital events have replaced rallies, in-person fundraising has been canceled, and election night parties just won’t happen. Because neither race is close — Biden has lapped Sanders in state polls and Trump has no serious challengers — any impact on the actual results will be minimal as Florida copes with its slice of a global pandemic. “Post South Carolina, when Biden surged in southern states, Florida experienced the same shift,” said Dan Newman, a Florida Democratic consultant who is unaligned in the presidential primary. “Basically, the race coalesced into Sanders and non-Sanders, and as a trusted national name, Biden was the beneficiary.” More than a million Florida Democrats already have voted by mail or at early voting locations, surpassing pre-primary day turnout in 2016, when 889,207 Democratic voters cast ballots. That year, Hillary Clinton was still fighting off Sanders, her primary rival. And even if Democratic turnout is low, it won’t give Republicans a valid reason to gloat, Newman said. “I don’t think turnout in a presidential primary with neither campaign particularly active, and in a state that’s functionally already decided, and in the middle of a global pandemic is predictive,” he said, “of much.”","Florida is weird.

"The early signals from the coronavirus crisis point to a scale of damage unseen in the modern U.S. economy: the potential for millions of jobs lost in a single month, a historic and sudden plunge in economic activity across the nation and a pace of sharp market swings not seen since the Great Depression. As the coronavirus outbreak ravages a paralyzed nation, Wall Street suffered another brutal bloodbath on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average diving around 13 percent in its worst percentage loss since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. A reading on business conditions in the New York area plunged a record 34.4 points to -21.5 in March, suggesting a recession is underway that could be sharp and deep as revenue quickly bleeds out of major industries from airlines to hotels, restaurants, bars and sports leagues. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the broadest gauge of U.S. companies, fell 12 percent. It has shed $6 trillion in value since peaking in February, slamming retirement accounts for millions of Americans in ways that could have psychological ripples for many months to come. The last time the S&P had three days of similar wild swings was 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression. The S&P is now only around 300 points away from wiping out all its gains since Donald Trump won the White House in November 2016. President Trump himself, one of the grandest boasters of the strength and resilience of markets and the American economy, appeared to capitulate on Monday with a more somber tone reflecting the immense magnitude of the challenge facing the nation. “We have an invisible enemy,” he said, acknowledging that the virus could push the U.S. into recession. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” Trump urged Americans not to gather in groups over 10 and to avoid bars, restaurants, food courts and other public spaces. The VIX, a gauge of fear and panic on Wall Street, hit 82.69 on Monday — bringing it to territory unseen since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008. Oil prices tanked 10 percent — after a severe plunge last week — as traders bet the virus will ignite a global recession that sharply reduces demand for fuel. The massive sell-offs have led to suggestions by market professionals that regulators may have to take dramatic steps seen during the Great Depression and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That could include shuttering Wall Street — perhaps for days — until more is known about the direction of the coronavirus spread in the United States and until Washington comes up with a massive, bipartisan policy response to shore up flagging industries and direct money straight into the pockets of American citizens losing work as they remain shuttered in their homes at the direction of the government officials. For now, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Jay Clayton pledged to keep markets open, despite the waves of panicked selling. “Markets should continue to function through times like this,” he told CNBC. Still, many traders expect that if the market plunges several more thousand points, and trips more circuit breakers that temporarily halt trading, the administration could be forced to simply shut Wall Street down. “With new measures being put in place by the hour, the federal government at some point will have to consider a modern version of the bank holiday imposed by the Roosevelt administration back in 1933,” RSM Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas wrote in a client note. “That four-day holiday was put into place to restore confidence in the banking and financial system. Perhaps the governing authority should consider a 10-business day holiday until Congress can act.” Wall Street analysts are already assessing the damage done to the economy thus far: stark and likely to get far worse, very quickly. “Movie box-office revenues are down more than 60 percent in data through March 15 and more than 70 percent relative to the average of recent years,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. “Broadway box office revenues were already down about 20 percent relative to trend in data through March 8, and are presumably set to be down essentially 100 percent after theaters closed last Thursday, a result we also expect to see for professional and college sports revenues.” Restaurant bookings were collapsing in many cities and may now plunge to zero. Streets are increasingly empty as citizens follow government warnings to slow the spread of the virus. The hope on the part of White House officials is not to avoid a sharp economic slowdown — they all know it is coming — but that the short-term pain from extreme measures will lead to a flattening in the curve of the virus spread. Then economic activity can be made up when the crisis ebbs. But that will require agreement on a massive package of aid for both individuals and corporations to stave off mass bankruptcies and waves of layoffs. The White House hopes for a V-shaped economic cycle this time: a recession in which growth plunges then sharply recovers as consumers emerge from their bunkers with jobs to go to and money to spend. Kevin Hassett, the former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman who remains in contact with Trump and the White House, said in an interview that jobs reports for March and April could show horrific numbers that will force massive congressional action if it has not already occurred by then. He predicted losses of perhaps over 1 million jobs in coming reports and a spike in the jobless rate. “We really could see the worst jobs reports we’ve ever seen in our history.” Hassett said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter. (Goldman Sachs economists also predicted a drop of around 5 percent in economic growth in the second quarter.) And he noted that infighting between the House and Senate and uncertainty about the next stimulus package from the White House could make matters far worse. The White House is trying to settle on a package that would include a payroll tax suspension and emergency lending facilities, including from the Federal Reserve, and other measures for impacted businesses that would stop short of direct cash “bailouts,” a politically toxic word since the bank rescues of 2008 and 2009. William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, suggested the United States is headed into what could be the first recession whose length and depth will be determined largely by how effectively Washington responds, both on the fiscal and public health fronts. “This will be first recession induced by public health policies, and the nature of those public health policies and their effectiveness accelerating the recovery from the virus. And that will determine the course of the depth of the recession.” Lee said he was certain the second quarter would show a contraction, but that multiple policies, most of which are currently under consideration, could prime the economy to bounce back. Those policies would include direct aid to corporations slammed by the virus, through loan forbearance and acceptance of late payments. He also suggested credit rating firms would have to take into account the impact of the virus when making ratings changes, including potentially crippling downgrades. On the consumer side, Lee said supplemental sick pay leave and extended benefits for laid-off workers would be critical along with payments to cover day care. “Our avenues for pushing this stuff out through negative income taxes for households can be easily done. The key thing as that as soon as people feel safe to go out, that they have money in their pockets and they go and spend it.” Lee said he did not believe in giving free money away to corporations, but that decisions would have to be made about which companies are simply mismanaged and which are suffering directly from the virus. “We have to be generous about getting money out. It’s really important to preserve the transport infrastructure. We can’t have airlines filing for bankruptcy.” Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist and IHS Markit, said in a note to clients that the spread of Covid-19 to the U.S. ""is causing a sharp contraction in spending on activities that involve travel and congregating in public.” His firm now expects a recession to start in the second quarter, delivering a peak-to-trough decline in GDP of 2.3 percent, with the jobless rate rising to 6 percent by mid-2021. Goldman Sachs analysts increased their expectations for stimulus action out of Washington. Their base case is to see stimulus worth 1 to 2 percent of GDP in both 2020 and 2021, or roughly $400 billion to $800 billion worth. White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Monday the administration was pursuing at least $800 billion in relief for an economy hit by the crisis. Steve Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president, said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal expected to come out of the White House and Treasury by the end of the week. Moore authored the proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point. But it’s on a fast-track. They want it by the end of the week,” Moore said. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Moore said his group suggested financing the payroll tax holiday by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decision about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Federal Reserve to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of existing assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “Trump listens to us. He seeks out our advice,” Moore said. “We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” “When the virus is contained, the economy will bounce back. But how long that will take and much damage is done to supply chains and the number of bankruptcies — we just don’t know. Every day this lasts compounds the economic damage.”",How ugly could it get?

"The nation's biggest banks, which were at the epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis, are facing a new set of daunting challenges with markets in turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic. While the lenders will probably be in no need of a multibillion-dollar bailout as they were back then, they’re dealing with stress from all sides as they’re pressured to help shield consumers, businesses and other financial firms from a wave of economic pain that has already begun to hit. Business debt is at record-high levels. Many consumers will struggle to repay bank loans if they face even one missed paycheck. And though lawmakers and regulators reined in some of the riskiest behavior at banks after the crisis, a lot of those same activities are still happening in other less-regulated companies that are financially connected to the large lenders. That means the banks will be tested on how well they’ve prepared for a global shock to the economy that no one saw coming. “The banks are not the problem right now,” said Karen Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics. But “they can only be fortresses for so long.” For their part, the megabanks are trying to project strength. In a March 11 meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said the financial system is “in sound shape, and we are here to help.” Bankers argue that they rely much less on debt to fund their operations and have much more cash on hand than they did during the crisis to help them keep lending during a downturn. Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and five other major banks said over the weekend that they'd stop buying back their own shares through June as they pledge to help struggling consumers and businesses. The largest banks have also successfully weathered the Federal Reserve’s so-called stress tests, which require them to show every year how they would manage risks under a hypothetical severe recession. The exercise was launched in 2009 in the depth of the crisis to help restore confidence in the banking system. But financial markets are already showing signs of strain, with stocks in recent weeks wiping out most of their huge gains since Trump's election and trading in U.S. government bond markets becoming irregular, a situation that prompted the Fed to inject piles of cash into funding markets. Troubles are also growing in the market for a type of short-term business debt known as commercial paper. One of the biggest risks that regulators like the Fed have been watching is the rise in loans to companies that are already highly indebted, as well as the volume of corporate bonds that are so risky that mutual funds may not be allowed to hold them. If a lot of companies start to default on their debt, it could blow back not only directly on banks, but also other lenders and investors that do business with them. “You’re going to have massive defaults as the economy turns down, and a massive amount of dumping of the worst debt as certain investment vehicles like mutual funds are getting out of it,” said Dennis Kelleher, who heads the financial regulation advocacy group Better Markets. “You put those two things together, and there is an enormous threat coming to all financial institutions, but particularly the biggest banks.” According to financial analytics firm Trepp, banks have diversified the sectors that they’re invested in, but have particular exposure to companies in real estate; about 10 percent of outstanding corporate loans at a surveyed group of large and medium-size banks were in that sector. Corporate debt could also grow. Companies like Boeing are reportedly drawing on existing lines of credit, while United Airlines is one of the coronavirus-hit businesses that has taken out a new secured loan to help weather decreased revenue. Lee Shaiman, executive director of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, said bundles of loans to highly indebted companies, known as collateralized loan obligations, aren’t at much risk from the industries that are being hardest hit, like energy and travel. “You don’t want to be Pollyanna-ish,” he said. “We’re in for a rough couple of weeks at least, but it’s very clear why we’re here, as opposed to the financial crisis where there were a lot of reasons and a lot of excesses.” Those CLOs are more transparent and more conservatively structured than the mortgage-backed securities that helped lead to the 2008 blowup, he said. Meanwhile, a lot of payments won’t even be due for years. Still, financial firms are connected to each other in ways that aren’t always clear, which will lead to an intense focus on how large indebted companies are faring. “This is a tinder box that the current regulators have told us is not of concern” for the broader financial system, said Sarah Bloom Raskin, former deputy Treasury secretary and onetime Fed board member. “We will see the extent to which their confidence is warranted.” Raskin also said banks need to be preparing to defer payments from small businesses and people who might be late on mortgage or credit card payments, something their regulators last week encouraged them to do. Some banks have already announced rate reductions on loans for vulnerable borrowers. “These are contributors to how long and deep this downturn is going to be,” she said.",Big banks brace for coronavirus-related onslaught,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/big-banks-coronavirus-onslaught-132997,politico
"The Justice Department is abandoning plans for a looming criminal trial focused on claims of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. With jury selection set to begin in just over two weeks, prosecutors asked a federal judge to permanently dismiss the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought two years ago against two Russian firms linked to a St. Petersburg businessman known as Putin's chef, Yevgeny Prigozhin. The move scuttles a trial that could have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump: a high-profile showcase of U.S. intelligence agencies' evidence that Russian trolls sought to stir up support for him in the 2016 presidential election while fighting against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee who oversaw the case, formally dismissed the charge against the two Russian firms Monday night. Prosecutors cited several reasons for the shift and were clearly defensive that Russia would portray the decision as proof that U.S. evidence of the alleged Russian tampering is weak. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea wrote. ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted. It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution,"" Demers and Shea added. They said the indictment would remain in place against Prigozhin and 12 other Russian nationals, as well as the company alleged to have coordinated the online rabble-rousing, the Internet Research Agency. Trump appeared to celebrate the dropping of the charges and the scuttling of the trial as more evidence of the flaws of Mueller's operation. Late Monday night, the president retweeted another user's comment about the developments: ""How embarrassing for Team Mueller."" A defense lawyer for the Russian company that may have surprised prosecutors by seeking a trial in the case, Eric Dubelier, said the prosecution suffered from ""fundamental problems"" from its outset. ""The purpose of this indictment was to make a political statement regarding the outcome of the 2016 election that was grossly overstated,"" said Dubelier, a partner with law firm Reed Smith.  ""In preparing for trial we had every intention to prevail given the problems with the government’s allegations. The government’s evidence was completely devoid of any information that could establish that the defendants knew what they were doing was in violation of highly complex U.S. laws and regulations. This was a make-believe charge to fit the facts solely for political purposes,"" he added. One reason prosecutors cited for their retreat was a recent “classification determination bearing on the evidence the government properly gathered during the investigation [which] limits the unclassified proof now available to the government at trial.” The public filing offered scant details, but suggested that someone in the U.S. intelligence apparatus had decided that disclosing some of the evidence against Concord would expose U.S. intelligence capabilities. Prosecutors asked to submit a separate, secret, classified filing to the court that explained those concerns in more detail. While prosecutors were not specific in their public filing, one disclosed at a recent court hearing that the Justice Department planned to introduce a mystery witness who they said would implicate Prigozhin in election interference outside Russia. It is unclear whether that person is an intelligence asset, defector or someone else.  Intelligence officials also may have concluded that revealing certain evidence against Concord could put at risk Russians who helped the U.S. conclude that the 2016 activities were directed by the Kremlin. One such Russian with Kremlin ties was housed by the CIA in the Washington suburbs until his identity became public last year.  The Justice Department also filed a criminal case last month that suggested the Russian government was seeking to closely monitor Russians cooperating with U.S. intelligence agencies.  From the outset, supporters of the Russian trolls' prosecution — and some critics of the effort — dubbed it a ""name and shame"" effort aimed more at seizing the public relations value of an indictment and less at the typical goal of bringing criminals to justice. No trial ever seemed likely unless one of the defendants stumbled into a place where they could be arrested. However, soon after the indictment was returned in February 2018, Prigozhin sought to call the American prosecutors' bluff without ever exposing himself to the risk of prison. One of his firms, Concord Management & Consulting, hired U.S. lawyers to fight the case. So, the U.S. found itself facing a trial without ever having a human defendant in the dock. That prospect has been relatively clear for nearly two years, but it took prosecutors until Monday — amid the national panic over coronavirus — to concede that going to the trouble of a trial against a company that has no known presence or funds in the U.S., simply wasn't worth it. ""The government has concluded that further proceedings as to Concord, a Russian company with no presence in the United States and no exposure to meaningful punishment in the event of a conviction, promotes neither the interests of justice nor the nation’s security,"" prosecutors wrote. One expert on classified information said Monday that the belated acknowledgment by the prosecution was jarring. ""It's a bit surprising that prosecutors would make this claim so late in the proceeding. It's something they ought to have realized (and may have) months ago or longer,"" said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. ""Prosecutors will want to do a postmortem to understand how they got themselves in this position, and how they can avoid similar missteps in the future."" Prosecutors said recent developments in the case contributed to their decision, including difficulties getting Concord to cooperate with court orders to turn over certain information. They faulted the company for submitting a declaration claiming full compliance that was attested to by Prigozhin, someone they described as ""incredible.""  Prigozhin is widely known as Putin's chef because he started out as a high-end restaurateur, developed close ties to the Russian president and built the food-focused business into an empire doing contracting around the world for the Russian military. Concord Management and a related catering company were charged in the criminal case with conspiracy against the U.S. for seeking to frustrate the operation of U.S. election, foreign-agent, and visa laws. Friedrich did not offer any comment on the government's about-face, but did agree to accept and seal the classified explanation prosecutors offered.",Justice Department drops plans for trial over Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/russia-election-justice-department-132875,politico
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants the Army Corps of Engineers to build overflow hospitals. Bernie Sanders wants to call up the National Guard. Joe Biden says ""call out the military — now."" But the military isn't a cure-all, and there are significant legal and practical limits to what the armed forces can do during the coronavirus crisis. “The Department of Defense is ready, willing and able to support civilian authorities to the greatest extent possible at the direction of the president,” Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman told reporters Monday. “We just want to make sure that the conversation that we have is informed by the facts of what is possible and what is not and what those tradeoffs are.” Here is a rundown of the different ways the military could be used in the crisis, along with jobs that should be left to others. Current and former officials have proposed tasking the Pentagon with growing the capacity of the health care system to treat the sickest patients, specifically by deploying field hospitals and constructing care facilities. On Sunday, Biden said the armed forces ""have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation. They have done it. They did it in the Ebola crisis.” But Defense Department officials stressed that while the military does have some experience deploying what they call “tent hospitals,” these facilities are limited in size and capability. Most are small community hospitals tailored for the military’s disproportionately young, healthy community and their families, said Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon. The field hospitals, while they range in size from 25 beds to “much larger,” are designed to support trauma patients and combat casualties, he told reporters Monday. “What we are trying to be very careful about is not over promising,” Friedrichs said. “There are not thousand-bed medical centers all over the U.S.; they are for the most part small community hospitals.” Retired Vice Adm. Matthew Nathan, the former surgeon general of the Navy, said there are some things the military could do to ease the medical burden, but agreed it could only do so much. ""What we are really good at is ramping up trauma capability in a hurry,"" he said in an interview. ""If we just need beds, we are good at that, too."" But he pointed out that even in the worst circumstances such as widespread battle injuries, the military commonly deals with patients who are otherwise healthy and don't suffer from underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to infectious disease such as the coronavirus. ""As far as setting up ICUs to take care of the roughly 6 to 7 percent of patients who will need intensive care and ventilators long term, we don't prepare for that,"" Nathan said. But he stressed that there are other strategies to ""expand the surge of our hospitals."" Instead of treating infected patients, the military could take care of limited numbers of others ""who just need regular hospital care because they are not severe"" in order to free up beds and staff. The Navy’s two medical ships, the USNS Mercy and the USNS Comfort, can handle large-scale medical emergencies. Both contain 12 fully-equipped operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, digital radiological services, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, a CAT-scan and other capabilities, according to the Navy. But that only helps in areas near the water. ""If for example a community has a large outbreak and there's a need for emergency room support or trauma support, a hospital ship is perfectly designed to do that,” Friedrichs said. ""It’s hard to get the hospital ship to St. Louis, but along the coasts it is an option to use."" Another problem is that these vessels are not conducive to containing infectious disease outbreaks. “You have litters that are stacked toward the ceiling with individuals, you have open bay rooms — they are intended for trauma not for infectious disease environment,” Hoffman said, adding that “there are some beds for that, but at much smaller numbers.” Teams of Army researchers are helping to develop a vaccine and other countermeasures for the virus at installations around the country, including Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, both in Maryland. The teams have identified a potential vaccine that targets what doctors called the “spoke” or “spike protein” that helps the virus attach and enter human cells, Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, director of emerging infectious diseases at Walter Reed, told reporters at the Pentagon last week. The Army is testing the vaccine candidate on mice and will next move to testing on larger animals and humans to determine whether it is safe. But the earliest the vaccine would be available to the general population is 12 to 18 months, Modjarrad said. More long term, Nathan also says the military has a number of research centers around the world that specialize in disease surveillance ""before they can get a toehold on our troops,” including in Egypt, Peru and Singapore. Perhaps the most famous military doctor, Walter Reed, made scientific breakthroughs in treating communicable diseases in the tropics. ""Why was Major Walter Reed down there? Soldiers were dying of yellow fever."" The National Guard is playing the largest role when it comes to the military's response. As of Monday, some 650 troops have been called up in 15 states to help operate drive-through virus testing facilities, staff emergency operations centers, clean public spaces and transport health care personnel. The biggest contingent to be activated so far is in New York, where as of Monday 516 part-time soldiers and airmen have been called up. In Colorado, 145 National Guardsmen were assisting with drive-up Covid-19 testing centers and helping to plan future screening missions, according to the National Guard Bureau in Washington. Smaller continents, such as eight troops in West Virginia specializing in biological defense, have been activated to train civilian first responders on how to mitigate the exposure to the virus of paramedics and fire and rescue personnel. ""Bottom line, our force must remain flexible, innovative and ready to help America mitigate the impacts of this virus,"" Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement Monday. But so far, Guardsmen have not yet been “federalized,” or called up on a national scale. That could mean siphoning them away from their civilian jobs where they may already be helping their communities to counter the virus, said Friedrichs. Nor have separate military reservists been called up. “If we mobilize the Guard and Reserve medical personnel from their civilian jobs, they are no longer in their civilian jobs and that directly impacts the community where they work — that’s the tradeoff,” he said. The military does have some options to more efficiently deploy Guard and Reserve personnel, said Hoffman, pointing out the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, one of the global epicenters of the virus, has enlisted Guard and Reserve doctors. Yet there are only so many trained medical professionals in the military to go around. The hospital ships, for example, are currently manned by merchant mariners. The medical personnel to staff them would have to come from elsewhere, Hoffman said. The White House has denied rumors that President Donald Trump is considering a national curfew to limit social interaction until the outbreak is under control. If such a decision were made, however, any military role would likely be limited. And it would fall to the National Guard. The active-duty military is barred from conducting domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. The only circumstance in which the active-duty could be called upon to provide security would be under the Insurrection Act to suppress a revolt (a Marine and Army division responded to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, for example). As of Monday, the active-duty military has been asked only to make available a trio of military bases to quarantine cruise ship passengers exposed to the coronavirus. And a spokesperson said no military personnel are involved. “We have a lot of different capacities and we don’t speculate on how or if we'd use it,"" said Stacey Knott, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command in Colorado, which is tasked with homeland defense and to support civil authorities in responding to natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. The National Guard Bureau says it is not planning to play any law enforcement role at this time. ""We have the capability to do something like that but we are not burning calories on something that may or may not be happening,"" said Army Master Sgt. Michael Houk, a Guard spokesperson. ""At this point it looks like it is not happening. We are addressing existing needs."" But if a national curfew is necessary to enforce, the best way to do it is to empower individual states to carry it out. That would fall to traditional law enforcement agencies, not troops, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Steven Blum, former chief of the National Guard Bureau and deputy commander of U.S. Northern Command. ""It depends on how the president sets up the curfew,"" Blum said in an interview. ""Does he set it up where the governors are responsible so they can use the state police to enforce? If all the state governors agree to it and support it then it would be pretty easy. ""If I were advising the president,"" he added, ""I would advise them not to federalize the response but to coordinate the response and allow the states to tailor the response within their guidelines.""",Why you can't just 'call out the military' to fix the coronavirus crisis,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/military-coronavirus-defense-132801,politico
"Seven days before Donald Trump took office, his aides faced a major test: the rapid, global spread of a dangerous virus in cities like London and Seoul, one serious enough that some countries were imposing travel bans.  In a sober briefing, Trump’s incoming team learned that the disease was an emerging pandemic — a strain of novel influenza known as H9N2 — and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. “Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,” Trump’s aides were told. Soon, they heard cases were popping up in California and Texas. The briefing was intended to hammer home a new, terrifying reality facing the Trump administration, and the incoming president’s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe, this 2017 crisis didn’t really happen — it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump’s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama.  And in the words of several attendees, the atmosphere was “weird” at best, chilly at worst. POLITICO obtained documents from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed-door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics, and top officials from both sides — whether they wanted to be there or not — were forced to confront a whole-of-government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges, such as shortages of ventilators, anti-viral drugs and other medical essentials, and that having a coordinated, unified national response was “paramount” — warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the administration. That extraordinary turnover in the months and years that followed is likely one reason his administration has struggled to handle the very real pandemic it faces now, former Obama administration officials said. “The advantage we had under Obama was that during the first four years we had the same White House staff, the same Cabinet,” said former deputy labor secretary Chris Lu, who attended the gathering. “Just having the continuity makes all the difference in the world.” Sean Spicer, Trump’s first White House press secretary, was among those who participated in the meeting. He said he understood the reasons such exercises could be useful, but described the encounter as a massive transfer of information that ultimately felt very theoretical. In real life, things are never as simple as what’s presented in a table-top exercise, he said. “There’s no briefing that can prepare you for a worldwide pandemic,” added Spicer, who left the administration in mid-2017. The outgoing Obama aides and incoming Trump aides gathered for roughly three hours on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. At least 30 representatives of Trump’s team — many of them soon-to-be Cabinet members — were present, each sitting next to their closest Obama administration counterpart. Incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to keep dozing off. Incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry was getting along famously with Ernest Moniz, the man he was replacing, several fellow participants said.  But it was clear some on the Trump team had barely, if ever, spoken with the people they were replacing. News had broken that same day about national security adviser Michael Flynn’s unusual contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, so his presence in the meeting added to the surrealness. Some members of both groups kept going in and out of the room, but most paid quiet attention to the presentations, which were led by top Obama aides. Obama aides, in op-eds and essays ripping the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, have pointed to the Jan. 13, 2017, session as a key example of their effort to press the importance of pandemic preparedness to their successors. In a Friday op-ed, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, blasted Trump for comments such as “you can never really think” that a pandemic like the coronavirus “is going to happen.” She mentioned the 2017 session as one of many instances of the Obama administration’s efforts to help its successor be ready for such a challenge. She also slammed the Trump team for dismantling the National Security Council section that would play a lead role in organizing the U.S. response to a global pandemic. “Rather than heed the warnings, embrace the planning and preserve the structures and budgets that had been bequeathed to him, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic,” Rice wrote. (Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who oversaw the dissolution of the NSC’s global health security and biodefense section, has defended it as necessary streamlining, countering that global health “remained a top NSC priority.” Trump, when recently asked about the reshuffling, called the question “nasty” and said, “I don’t know anything about it.”) Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, explained the thinking behind the January 2017 session in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs. “Although the exercise was required, the specific scenarios we chose were not,” she wrote. “We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.” None of the sources argued that one meeting three years ago could have dramatically altered events today. But Obama aides say the Trump administration’s fumbling of the coronavirus outbreak is partly rooted in how unprepared — and in some cases unwilling — it was to engage in transition exercises at all in late 2016 and early 2017. David Shulkin, who was an Obama appointee at the time but had been nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary in the Trump administration, said in an interview that with the exception of this exercise, which he didn’t recall well, he noticed that in his agency, there had been “little coordination” and “very little interest in working with the Obama appointees.”  “They had said we don’t really have a lot of need to talk to the Obama appointees,” he said. That botched handoff sparked weeks of confusion, all the way up to Inauguration Day. “There was a frenzy before the transition where I was asked to consider staying because the [preparedness] mission was so important,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as Obama’s Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, where she worked on crises like the Ebola virus outbreak and attended the pandemic exercise. “Then through the HHS secretary’s office, the next day, I heard they changed their mind.” The Trump campaign, like the rest of America, was shocked to win the November 2016 election. Soon afterward, Trump cast aside his team’s transition prep work that had happened already and started over; some of his aides described tossing carefully collected binders full of possible personnel picks into trash bins. It was days, sometimes weeks, before his nominees and their aides showed up to meet the people they were replacing — if they did so at all — or to engage in transition meetings. Obama aides said they left detailed memos for their successors, but that quite often it appeared those memos were never read. Many on the Obama side were genuinely surprised that so many actually showed up for the Jan. 13, 2017, exercise, and there were expectations that some would skip it. On the Obama side, several agencies were represented by their second-in-command at the meeting for reasons including a belief that Trump’s principals wouldn’t show. The gathering was held to satisfy a requirement in a 2016 law that updated the procedures around presidential transitions to require, among other things, that the outgoing administration “prepare and host interagency emergency preparedness and response exercises.” Obama also mentioned it in a 2016 executive order laying out his transition goals. The 2016 law came about at the urging of the Partnership for Public Service, a good-government organization that helps administrations and candidates with the transition process. The emergency preparedness provisions were inspired by how George W. Bush handled his transition to Obama; that process, regarded as the gold standard for transition planning, included joint exercises on how to react to improvised explosive devices in cities. Bush had insisted on a detailed and highly coordinated transition planning in part because he felt scarred by the rushed transition he’d experienced from the Bill Clinton administration, not to mention having to deal with the Sept. 11 attacks during his first year. “The idea was hatched after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina precisely to prepare for situations like today,” said David Marchick, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition.  The Obama and Trump teams met in the afternoon, sitting around tables arranged in a rectangle. Participants were given a binder of unclassified materials titled “Presidential Transition Exercise Series,” the contents of which were obtained by POLITICO. The purpose of the exercise, the documents state, was to “familiarize” the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices and continuity of government programs” in case it faced a major crisis. One key goal was to explain to participants the various legal authorities they had to pursue a response, and which agencies had which capabilities and responsibilities. The references provided included detailed explanations of numerous laws and regulations that might affect their work, such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Aside from the H9N2 pandemic exercise, the participants discussed the case study of how the Obama administration handled Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One section covered a potential cyber incident. Another went through how to respond to a domestic terrorism incident, in this case one carried out by a group of U.S. citizens who placed bombs in nearby spots during a major sporting event in a U.S. city. The terror squad not only detonates the bombs, it also engages in a mass shooting and takes a dozen hostages. Using the materials, Monaco led the discussion. Her incoming counterpart, Tom Bossert, acted as a “semi co-chair,” attendees said. Ross, the then 79-year-old incoming Commerce secretary, was spotted with his eyes closed on more than one occasion. Elaine Chao, tapped to run the Department of Transportation, paid close attention. Several attendees noted the tense body language between Rice and Flynn, who lasted only a few weeks as Trump’s national security adviser and was ousted amid questions over his dealings with Russian officials. And then there was the Energy Department duo: Perry, the incoming secretary who previously served as the governor of Texas, and Moniz, the outgoing secretary and famed physicist. The pair seemed to get along fabulously, which stood out to other attendees given the overall distrust between the two teams and the fact that Perry had once proposed getting rid of the Energy Department altogether. It was a “semi-bizarro lovefest” between the two, a fellow participant said. “They were ready to go make a buddy movie.”  Perry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, Moniz, who now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, said, “It is correct that [Perry] and I offered relevant perspectives from a governor’s and Cabinet secretary’s seat, respectively. As governor of Texas for a long time, Perry had been through many episodes needing crisis management.” For the most part, however, the Trump team was in receive mode.  Partly, that was not a surprise: Many of Trump’s personnel choices had little or no government experience, and the Obama aides were presenting massive troves of information to them about how a raft of agencies had to work together to respond to various crises. Multiple current and former Trump officials reached by POLITICO said they did not recall much about the briefing. But some Obama aides who attended said they were left with the impression that many of the Trump aides showed up to simply check off a box more than to learn. The impression was boosted in part because the transition overall was going so poorly. Several Trump nominees had barely even spoken to their Obama counterparts.  The State Department representative at the meeting, for instance, was Tom Shannon, a veteran career foreign service officer serving as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Shannon attended instead of Secretary of State John Kerry in part because he would be staying on under Trump and was essentially the “transition designee.” But that Jan. 13, 2017, session was the first time he’d seen the incoming secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in person since Trump picked him for the job a month earlier. (Before the inauguration, Kerry and Tillerson spoke once, by phone, for a few minutes, people familiar with the situation said.) “The problem is that they came in very arrogant and convinced that they knew more than the outgoing administration — full swagger,” one former Obama administration official who attended said.  “There were people who were there who said, ‘This is really stupid and why do we need to be here,’” added another senior Obama administration official who attended, alleging that Ross and incoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were especially dismissive in conversations on the sidelines of the session. “But some Trump people, like Tom Bossert, were trying to take it seriously.” Asked for comment, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for DeVos, told POLITICO: “This is nothing more than a hit piece with no basis in reality. This department, under the secretary’s leadership, has taken swift action to support students, parents, and education leaders during this pandemic and will continue to do so. This former Obama official’s wild claims don’t comport with reality.” A Commerce Department spokesperson denied that Ross had dozed off. ""Secretary Ross found the meeting quite interesting and informative, taking many notes during the exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He continues to rely upon that knowledge and experience as he assists the president in confronting the crisis at hand."" Another participant noted that such exercises are primarily aimed at helping an incoming administration make it through the first several months of its tenure — “the idea being, of course, that during the transition period we’re uniquely vulnerable.”  Presumably, by the third or fourth year in power, the administration would have its own processes and muscle memory, the participant said. Asked whether information about the pandemic exercise reached the president-elect, a former senior Trump administration official who attended the meeting couldn’t say for sure but noted that it wasn’t “the kind of thing that really interested the president very much.”  “He was never interested in things that might happen. He’s totally focused on the stock market, the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit,” the person said. “The possibility things were things he didn’t spend much time on or show much interest in. “Even though we would put time on the schedule for things like that, if they happened at all, they would be very, very brief,” the former official continued. “To get the president to be focused on something like this would be quite hard.”  Anything associated with Obama or his administration was also a no-go zone for Trump aides. If you brought them up, “that would be an immediate rejection, like, ‘Why are they even here? Why the fuck did you ask them?’” Ben Lefebvre contributed to this report.","Before Trump’s inauguration, a warning: ‘The worst influenza pandemic since 1918'",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797,politico
"At Sunday night’s debate, Bernie Sanders scoffed at Joe Biden’s nearly $2 trillion — with a “t” — plan to combat climate change. “What Joe is saying is nowhere near enough,” Sanders said, dismissing Biden as an incrementalist. Republicans could barely contain their glee. To them, Biden’s pronouncements on a range of issues — from energy to immigration to health care — provided a trove of on-camera material to paint him as a radical in moderate’s clothing in the general election. Though Biden drew praise for a strong debate performance, his commitments underscored the line he’s trying to straddle between pragmatism and progressivism as he works to unite the party as the likely Democratic nominee. Republicans think his positioning will be particularly harmful in the Rust Belt states that decided the 2016 election, and where Biden is seen as a particular threat to Trump. “He effectively called for open borders — no deportations — and has already raised his hand for taxpayer-funded health care for illegals,” Scott Jennings, a former political aide in the George W. Bush White House, said of Biden’s leftward drift. “So, at the same time he’s called for a ban on fracking, he’s opening up America to a flood of illegal immigration. I’m sure this will fly in Pennsylvania and the rest of the upper Midwest. This issue — not to mention the tax increases to pay for abortions — will hurt badly in rural areas and in the big Senate races.” A Trump campaign aide told POLITICO on Monday that Biden had “openly declared war” on traditional energy sources, effectively pledging “a death sentence for the oil and natural gas industries.” Biden called for an end to new fracking (his staff later clarified he only meant on federal land). He said he’d endeavor to take millions of cars off the road, convert gas-powered fleets to clean-burning and end drilling on federal lands. He’d haul the world’s 100 biggest polluters before the U.S. in his first 100 days and make them pay an economic price. He’d convene the hemisphere to provide tens of billions for Brazil to stop burning the Amazon.  And that was on the environment alone. From immigration to social issues to health care, Republicans insist Biden is harming himself in battleground states where his appeal to centrist Democrats has long been viewed as an unmitigated asset. In a statement following the debate, Trump’s campaign even tried to yoke Biden to Sanders on health care, arguing that both offer “a complete government takeover” of the system. The warning shots at Biden come as Trump is message-testing ways to drive up excitement among his restive base while struggling with the enormous responsibilities of managing the coronavirus pandemic. Biden aides and allies view charges that he’s making himself vulnerable to Trump as fanciful. A Biden campaign official rejected the thinking outright, saying Trump will have to defend his record of supporting efforts in the courts to strip essential health coverage from millions. The Biden aide pointed to Trump’s caging of immigrant children and demonization of immigrants as antithetical to America’s values and his ignorance of the climate emergency as costing the U.S. when it should be pursuing green jobs. “These guys are going to have a tough time turning Joe Biden into an extremist liberal in this environment. In that context, Sanders served as a great foil for Biden,” said Tim Miller, a former adviser to Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, who voted for Biden in California’s March 3 primary. “Biden spent 30 minutes waving off Sanders’ claims that a trillion-dollar climate change plan is not enough — this is how you make a bold agenda look pretty centrist.” Trump’s campaign has signaled in recent days that it will try numerous approaches to confronting Biden — from questioning his mental acuity to focusing on what they view as his out-of-step liberalism. Dan Pfeiffer, the former Barack Obama adviser, dismissed the Republican strategy as reeking of desperation for a Trump campaign that had been planning to run against Sanders. The Vermont senator had appeared ascendant leading into Super Tuesday. “Trump already has the voters driven primarily by immigration,” Pfeiffer said, “so it’s about base maintenance as opposed to growing his vote share to a number sufficient to win.” “Several strategies,” he added, “is the same as no strategy.” For months, Biden has unveiled far-reaching plans that would make him a more progressive nominee than Hillary Clinton or his 2008 running mate, former President Barack Obama. Yet Biden has continued with his move left on past statements and policies relating to immigration, abortion, criminal justice and entitlement programs like Social Security. Now, poised to wrap up the nomination, he has grasped for even more olive branches as part of a broader effort to unify Democrats. Biden, who leads Trump in several battleground polls, has endorsed former rival Elizabeth Warren’s sweeping bankruptcy plan to strike through portions of a law that they once fought over. Ahead of Sunday’s debate, he gave his blessing to a Sanders-inspired plan to make college tuition free for students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. The debate offered him yet another chance to appeal to progressives. Biden pledged that under his administration only felons would be deported in his first 100 days, saying he’d focus on uniting families. “It’s about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent, he said. Biden also said undocumented immigrants arrested by local police should not be turned over to federal immigration authorities, after opposing sanctuary cities as a presidential candidate in 2007. He again distanced himself from voting for the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funding for the majority of abortions. Biden also restated his policy on public lands and waters, including prohibiting permitting of oil and gas drilling. Trump’s campaign has focused intently on Biden’s environmental and immigration remarks. “Fossil fuel industries employ 10 million Americans and he would yank the jobs out from under all of them. His plan would also drive heating and cooling bills through the roof,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s reelection campaign. Murtaugh said Biden’s plan to halt deportations would leave enormous numbers of other criminals in the U.S. who continue to pose a threat to public safety. And Biden’s position on locals not cooperating with federal immigration officials would “effectively turn the entire United States into a sanctuary country and tell the world that our borders are open,” he said. In a Monday email, America Rising, the Republican opposition outfit, cited a Wall Street Journal infographic that tallied up Biden’s agenda as costing more than twice as much as Clinton’s, with his proposed taxes totaling three times as much as the Democratic nominee four years ago. The message: Biden and Sanders “will be virtually indistinguishable.” “As we have said over and over, the eventual Democrat candidate will have to adopt the agenda of the extreme left in order to become the nominee in the first place, and Joe Biden proved that last night,” Murtaugh added.","Trump licks his chops as Biden veers left on sanctuary cities, fracking",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/biden-conservatives-trump-132214,politico
"A potential shortage of cotton swabs and other basic supplies needed for coronavirus testing is emerging as a new threat to the Trump administration’s plans to roll out high-volume testing to 2,000 sites across the country by the end of the week. President Donald Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said that millions of Americans could be tested in the coming weeks. But behind the scenes, some officials are warning the nation’s commercial labs that kinks in the supply chain for basic lab materials are the latest obstacle to broader testing. During a Sunday night conference call, HHS Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir warned more than 300 representatives of commercial laboratories, hospitals and state health departments that the Trump administration anticipates supply “speed bumps” as testing expands, a person on the call told POLITICO. The materials in question include swabs that medical workers use to collect samples of patients’ phlegm and saliva for testing, and disposable plastic tips for the pipettes that lab technicians use to transfer liquids. Testing labs say they’re also concerned about the availability of personal protective equipment for their staff. Fears about securing these basic supplies are the latest concern for public health officials as they scramble to institute the widespread testing that is desperately needed to track the spread of the coronavirus and limit the growing U.S. outbreak. The pace of U.S. testing has been slowed by shortages of critical materials used to prep patient samples for analysis and problems with an early test developed by the CDC. Now, the contrast between the administration’s public and private messaging on its plan to expand testing is rankling U.S. labs. The Trump administration announced Friday that it is creating a national network of 2,000 high-volume testing sites, with each processing 2,000 to 4,000 samples a day by the end of this week. To help reach that expanded testing goal, the Food and Drug Administration said Sunday that public health labs no longer have to send coronavirus samples to the CDC to be confirmed. That should reduce the wait for test results and the number of tests conducted for each patient, said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Twitter. The FDA also recently approved the use of more types of cotton swabs and of high-volume testing systems manufactured by Roche and Thermo Fisher. About 122 of of the Roche testing machines are installed at U.S. labs, the investment bank SVB Leerink said Monday, while Thermo Fisher said it is shipping its equipment to about 200 labs. And companies such as Qiagen, Quidel, Hologic and Cepheid are developing their own high-volume testing systems. But the commercial labs that are now performing the bulk of the country’s coronavirus tests say they need help from the government to secure sufficient numbers of swabs and other low-tech equipment. “We need the continued commitment from HHS and the administration to work with us to maintain the necessary volume of supplies,” Tom Sparkman, senior vice president of government affairs and policy at the American Clinical Laboratory Association, told POLITICO. State officials have echoed those concerns. “I’m worried now about access to an adequate number of swabs, not just the RNA extraction kits” used to prepare samples for analysis, said California Gov. Gavin Newsom at a press conference on Sunday. Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association, expressed anxiety over the United States’ testing failures and the looming shortages of equipment to test patients and protect lab technicians and other health care workers. “In order to take the specimen, it requires full personal protective equipment,” she said. “We are already short.” Victoria Colliver and Angela Hart contributed to this report.",Latest coronavirus testing glitch: Not enough cotton swabs,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-testing-glitch-cotton-swabs-132692,politico
"The Senate on Monday unanimously adopted a short-term extension of key federal surveillance programs that expired on Sunday night — a move that allows the chamber to more rapidly consider legislation addressing the economic impacts of the global coronavirus pandemic.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped an initial procedural vote Monday night on a House-passed bill that would reauthorize now-expired provisions of the 2015 USA Freedom Act and alter the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Instead, McConnell and his leadership team worked out a deal with civil libertarian hard-liners who oppose that House bill, including Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), on a 77-day extension of the surveillance powers. As part of the agreement, Lee and Paul also secured a package of amendment votes on the House bill, which has the backing of Attorney General William Barr and leaders from both parties in the House.  “We shouldn’t have to wait until the moment when we’re on the eve of the expiration of some important legislation and where we have to wait for the president of the United States to weigh in and lean in,” Lee said. “From time to time, laws require revision and review and reform. That always necessarily requires amendments.”  Senators were under intense pressure to clear the legislative docket to allow for the chamber to quickly take up a bill intended to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The House is expected to send a final version to the Senate as early as Monday night.  Lee and Paul, for their part, vehemently oppose the House’s FISA bill, contending that it does not go far enough to reform law enforcement’s surveillance authority. But they said they would be willing to back a temporary extension of the provisions if Senate GOP leaders allow amendment votes on the House bill, which passed in the lower chamber last week with a bipartisan majority.  “They can do it the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that they allow debate,” Paul told reporters.  Other senators indicated earlier Monday that they would support a temporary extension of the FISA powers out of concern that a prolonged lapse would hinder the U.S. intelligence community’s work.  “If the alternative is staying dark, I’ll take an extension,” Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) told reporters. McConnell did not address the negotiations on Monday afternoon, only saying the House bill was the best path forward.  “It reauthorizes the tools, which our national security requires, while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” McConnell said.  “The Senate should not wait to act,” McConnell added. “I sincerely hope that even our colleagues who may wish to vote against the House bill will not make us prolong this brief lapse in authorities and that we will be able to get these tools back online this week.”  Last week, Lee attempted numerous times to secure unanimous consent for a short-term extension, with an agreement to vote on four amendments to the House-passed bill at a later date. But Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) objected to Lee’s requests, saying it was unnecessary to drag out a debate over the FISA provisions.  Lee also spoke with President Donald Trump earlier that day and said the president told him he did not support the House bill. However, House Republicans indicated late last week that Trump does, in fact, support the legislation.  Three key FISA provisions lapsed on Sunday night after the Senate failed to reauthorize them before the deadline. The House bill addressed bipartisan concerns about possible overreach by the surveillance courts and ended an already deactivated National Security Agency program that allowed the organization to obtain, with judicial approval, Americans’ phone records in terror investigations.  The legislation strengthened privacy statutes and placed new restrictions on the FISA courts — inspired in part by Trump’s frequent complaints about his former campaign adviser, Carter Page, who was wiretapped as part of the U.S. government’s initial investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

"The House is unlikely to return from recess next week as scheduled, with Democratic leaders expected to keep the chamber dark until the next coronavirus stimulus package is ready for a vote, according to multiple Democrats.  Speaking on a conference call with the caucus Monday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats not to plan to return March 23 as scheduled and to stay tuned for more updates on Thursday. The announcement comes as congressional leaders face dueling missions: how to stave off economic disaster, while simultaneously protecting the hundreds of lawmakers — many of whom are older — from catching and spreading the coronavirus.   Several aides cautioned the chamber could resume legislative action as soon as the next day — March 24 — if the House was ready to vote on a third tranche of recovery money. Congressional leaders are in early negotiations over a massive legislative package they hope will heed off a potential economic collapse as industries, including airlines, hotels and restaurants, shutter to help prevent the spread of the virus.  U.S. airlines are seeking nearly $60 billion in grants and loans, according to a memo distributed on Monday, warning that Congress must act urgently to help several carriers avoid a “potential valley of death” going into the summer months. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, told Democrats he expects the impact on the industry to be “way worse than 9/11,” adding that some airlines are in “free fall,” according to sources on the call Monday.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) instructed Democrats to send ideas about what they’d like to see in the legislation to her office as House and Senate negotiators begin working in earnest on the next bill.  The House left town early Saturday morning after clearing a multibillion dollar stimulus package — its second bill aimed at stemming the outbreak — though it’s currently stalled in the Senate as negotiators hammer out a slew of technical tweaks.  Even so, Democrats and Republicans have been quick to focus their attention on the third legislative response to the outbreak — a measure that is expected to be the biggest so far, with members already comparing its size and scope with the bailouts approved amid the 2008 financial collapse.  Congressional leaders, as well as rank-and-file members of both parties, have already begun floating dramatic plans, such as cash handouts similar to the idea of universal basic income, popularized in the 2020 race by presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Several Democrats asked questions on the call about the possibility of a universal basic income policy — which Pelosi herself had initially been skeptical of, when it was floated at a recent Democratic meeting, though support has been gradually ticking up on both sides.  Pelosi told members on Monday that the priority was to keep people healthy and put money in people’s pockets, specifically mentioning refundable tax credits or some other mechanism, according to people familiar with the call. Top Democrats also discussed the possibility of expanding Medicaid, creating additional price-gouging protections and shoring up local transit and Amtrak.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday pitched a massive $750 billion proposal that includes direct cash payments as well as substantial support for small businesses and hospitals.   House leaders are also working to balance efforts to prop up the economy with anxiety among their own members, who waited around the Capitol for days while Pelosi negotiated a package of coronavirus response measures with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Members privately worried that they were being forced into packed meetings and hallways crowded with reporters and staff, despite increasingly pitched warnings from experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid those precise situations.  The CDC has now recommended that all gatherings of more than 50 people be canceled for the next eight weeks, complicating plans for the 435-member House and its thousands of staffers. Many Capitol Hill offices have already implemented teleworking strategies for aides, and some lawmakers have either self-quarantined or gotten tested for coronavirus after brushes with people who later tested positive. So far, no member of Congress has reported testing positive for the illness.  House leaders revealed Monday that they would be taking steps to prevent too many members from being on the floor even during votes, the rare occasion when most lawmakers congregate at the same time. Leadership offices in both parties have discussed ideas such as keeping votes open longer, to limit physical contact among members ""[P]lans are being developed to coordinate votes in order to limit the number of Members voting on the Floor at any one time,"" Hoyer's office wrote in a schedule update. Pelosi told lawmakers they may vote according to state or some other procedure when they do come back to limit the number of lawmakers being on the floor at the same time.  On Sunday, Pelosi wrote a letter to House members responding to their growing concerns and encouraging new steps to promote “social distancing” — measures to prevent close contact between people in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. “This may entail more than half of your Washington staff teleworking from home,” Pelosi wrote. “As this public health emergency develops, the House will continue to take strong, strategic and science-based action to keep the American people safe and ensure the continuity of Congressional operations.”",House eyes extended recess as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/house-coronavirus-recess-132370,politico
"The White House aims to deploy at least $800 billion in aid in the coming weeks to prop up the U.S. economy, as retailers, restaurants, sporting events and other businesses shut down and Americans slow their spending while staying home to guard against the coronavirus pandemic. Among the administration’s targets this week: providing relief in the form of tax deferments, loans or even direct payments to airlines, the hospitality industry and small-to-medium businesses crippled by plunging demand. Officials know they need to release the contours of their plan quickly — potentially as soon as Tuesday — as turmoil accelerates in financial markets, said a person familiar with the White House’s plans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow have specifically cited aid for U.S. airlines, as travelers cancel trips or avoid new bookings and public health experts advise older Americans to avoid flying entirely. “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch, we’re going to try to help them,” Kudlow told reporters Monday at the White House. He said the airlines had been in touch seeking aid, “lots of them,” and that “we’re in touch about their balance sheets and their cash flow.” Hotel CEOs are planning to visit the White House on Tuesday to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, as the hospitality industry also struggles from a serious downturn. The Treasury Department and National Economic Council met several times over the weekend to develop a list of options for the administration’s next phase of fiscal stimulus and held several conversations with President Donald Trump, said one senior administration official. So far, officials have discussed allowing industries such as airlines to defer tax payments or temporarily keep some of the taxes they collect from consumers. Airlines are seeking even greater assistance — nearly $60 billion worth — as they cancel flights and park plans due to collapsing demand for travel. The hotel industry has suggested options to help with their cash crunch including loans from the Small Business Administration, deferring tax liabilities, a temporary payroll tax cut or a tax credit to retain employees. Other suggestions have included offering loan guarantees, loan forbearance or the cancellation of debts through executive action or regulatory changes, said a Republican in close contact with the administration. Within the past week, as business plunged across the nation, the internal discussion among top economic officials has moved toward providing industries with cash and not just tax relief — even if no one in the White House wants to call it a bailout.  Kudlow said he preferred to call it more of a “short-term liquidity issue.” The goal is to help industries deal with the cash-flow crises they’ll likely face in the coming weeks, even if the administration sees no evidence of systemic risk. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point,” said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean, and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Industries across the board are starting to latch onto the idea of suspending the payroll tax for employers for the rest of the year. The largest business lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, included the idea in a letter it sent to Congress on Monday, and Trump has said he’d like the payroll tax either cut or suspended through the end of the year. Leaders from sectors including airlines, hotels and casinos have been warning officials behind closed doors about concerns they’ll have to start laying off thousands of employees if the shutdown throughout America continues — including in politically sensitive states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Half of the $800 billion in aid, under the latest White House estimates, would come from aid to workers and small businesses, tax deferrals and other moves already underway including deferring student-loan interest, buying oil and additional provisions of a relief bill already moving through Congress. The other half would come from a payroll-tax holiday through the end of the year — a move that would likely cost much more than $400 billion. The administration is also exploring with the Federal Reserve how it can deploy the central bank’s emergency powers to lend to nonfinancial firms, though the central bank’s authorities were curtailed in the political backlash to the 2008 bailout of insurer American International Group. The White House and economic officials are desperate to stave off a potential recession, since the economy has been one of the hallmark achievements of Trump’s first term and a key message for his reelection. The former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview that the March jobs report out early next month might show losses of more than 1 million. “It really could be the worst jobs report we’ve ever seen in our history.” He said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by a severe 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter.  “There is a dispute between the House and the Senate and the president about what to do,” Hassett said. “But imagine if it’s Friday when the jobs report comes out and it’s worse than we’ve ever seen. Then you’d see Congress act with urgency. The question is if they act with urgency ahead of the terrible numbers.” Hassett, who remains in contact with the White House, says he is not in favor of direct industry bailouts but is arguing for the payroll tax suspension at least for a quarter of the year. “You can do it quickly on the employer side and we need employers not to fire people,” he said. “And on the employee side, it could have a macro-economic effect. You could even offset the 5 percent economic decline with the payroll tax cut. And we don’t have to have a recession if the virus fades and the third quarter booms.”  In addition to hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders directly, the White House is hearing from informal economic advisers such as Moore with their proposals.  Moore said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal that’s expected to emerge from the White House and Treasury Department in the coming days. Moore authored a proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. The group suggested financing the payroll tax cut by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decisions about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Fed to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “We aren’t sure which of these Larry and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin like, but Trump listens to us,” Moore said. “He seeks out our advice. We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” A former senior Treasury official still in contact with senior members of the department said Mnuchin is aware that many Republicans will have problems with direct bailout payments to individual industries, but that he may propose them anyway for airlines, cruise lines and the entertainment industry more broadly. “The problem is the Wall Street [Troubled Asset Relief Program] vote still haunts those halls,” this former official said of the 2008 vote to bail out big banks. “It’s going to be like pulling teeth to get Republicans to vote for that. I think the White House is also open to refundable tax credits. And then you have the challenge of, ‘How do you help people exempt from the payroll tax?’’’ The person added that a plan could not wait until the end of the week. “It has to happen right away. Like, right now. Otherwise businesses are just going to start closing and laying people off right away.” Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",Trump team prepares rescue package of at least $800 billion,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-relief-package-132369,politico
"President Donald Trump on Monday acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic, releasing strict new guidelines to limit people’s interactions in an increasingly urgent bid to slow the virus in the next two weeks before U.S. hospitals are overwhelmed. “We have an invisible enemy,” the president said at a news conference, where he released guidelines that called for people to avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, steer clear of eating and drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts, and work or attend school from home whenever possible. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” The guidelines — including a strict recommendation that anyone with even minor symptoms stay home — are not mandatory. But they were issued with a sense of alarm and a frankness that Trump has not previously displayed. The president acknowledged that the crisis — which has already killed thousands around the world and set off a plunge of world markets — could last until July or August and even plunge the nation into a recession. No country, including the United States, has it under control, he said, though he also suggested America could limit its death toll “if we do a really good job” responding now. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus,” Trump said. “If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation, and we will defeat the virus, and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly.” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that while some people may perceive the guidelines as inconvenient or going too far, they reflect a deteriorating assessment of the containment efforts and should be taken seriously. “When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are. That’s not word speak. It means if you think you’re here,” Fauci said, gesturing to illustrate his point, “you’re really here because you’re only getting the results. Therefore, it will always seem that the best way to address it would be to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction. It isn’t an overreaction.” The White House gave the country a 15-day window to flatten the soaring curve of infection, but some disease modelers see a trajectory that could create a crisis, similar to Italy, that would start to overwhelm the U.S. health care system in about 10 days. Fauci called the 15 days “a trial” period for the guidelines to be reconsidered. “It isn’t that these guidelines are now gonna be in effect until July,” he clarified. “What the president was saying is the trajectory of the outbreak may go until then.” The new guidelines come on the heels of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance Sunday night that recommended the cancellation and postponement of gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. It also comes after the Office of Personnel Management declared federal offices in the Washington, D.C., area open but with maximum flexibility for telework. The president’s remarks reflect the increased urgency of the moment. As recently as Sunday, Trump was telling Americans to “relax” and that the pandemic would pass. And on Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow predicted that the outbreak would only impact the economy in the short term — “weeks and months,” he said, not years.  But hours later, Trump said the situation was “bad,” and administration officials pointed to new predictive modeling showing a need for more stringent social distancing measures. The case for aggressive social distancing is clear: A coronavirus vaccine is at least a year away, and the acceleration of the outbreak within the U.S. has put the it on track with some of the world’s hardest-hit nations.  “If everybody does what we’ve asked for in the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference,” said Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator. More than a month-and-a-half into the response effort and after failed bids to prevent and then contain the disease’s spread, the Trump administration is now scrambling to put its full weight behind a messaging campaign aimed at convincing people to do something simple yet unnatural: stay home. Still, public health experts said the administration has much work to do to sell Americans on such an abrupt change in habits and rebuild its credibility after weeks of mixed messages.  Trump was joined at the briefing by his key health advisers, including Fauci, Birx and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration’s response.  A growing number of governors earlier Monday followed the lead of fellow executives, announcing closures of bars, restaurants and other venues in states across the country. The new guidance similarly calls for any bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other venues to be closed in areas where there’s evidence of community transmission. Trump held separate video teleconferences with G-7 leaders and governors on Monday morning to discuss the response to the coronavirus. “Went very well,” he tweeted after speaking to governors. During the call, however, Trump urged governors to try to get respirators, ventilators and other equipment themselves. Hospital systems have raised alarms over a lack of beds and medical supplies to handle the crush of anticipated patients, and already some hospitals are beginning to postpone certain procedures in an effort to free up space and medical personnel. “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves,” the president told them, according to a source in the room. “Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” The New York Times first reported the president’s remarks to governors. Trump told reporters that governors would be able to get what they need sooner if they don’t rely on the federal government. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said while “the words did not quite come out right,” the president encouraged states to use whatever supply chains they have access to while the federal government attempts to maintain more respirators and ventilators. Administration officials also stressed the important role millennials can play in combating the spread of the virus. Birx called that generation “the core group that will stop the virus.” She said millennials are the most likely group to be the least symptomatic but also the group most likely to be out and about and in social gatherings. That means they could unknowingly spread the virus to older people or those with underlying issues, who are more vulnerable, if they ignore guidance and recommendations, but they’re also adept at communicating via text and across social media platforms. “Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25- to 35-year-old may find interesting and something that they’ll take to heart,” Birx said. “But millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.” Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CNN on Monday morning that the U.S. was “at a critical inflection point,” noting that America now has the same number of cases that Italy had two weeks ago. Italy is now on lockdown as it deals with more than 27,000 cases of the coronavirus, trailing only China, where the outbreak began. And public health experts have warned that without further dramatic steps, the U.S. could look like Italy by month’s end, with hospitals swamped by sick patients and hundreds of thousands of infected people freely circulating. “We have a choice to make: Do we want to really lean into social distancing and mitigation strategies and flatten the curve or do we just want to keep going on with business as usual and end up being Italy?” Adams said. As of Monday afternoon, more than 4,100 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing becomes available. More than 70 people have died.

"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a state judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an unprecedented order closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. Now, officials and voting rights experts say it's not clear whether and how voters will be able to participate in the still-scheduled primary with polling places shuttered, though DeWine, a Republican, has pledged to ""to extend voting options."" ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" he said Monday. But the state has not yet laid out the path to letting people vote.  ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" Ohio is one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward on Tuesday. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ...

"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is stepping up its response to the coronavirus by shutting its border to nearly all non-residents, except for U.S. citizens. Speaking to reporters Monday outside his residence, Trudeau said people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents will be denied entry into Canada. He noted there are exceptions for airline crews, diplomats, immediate family members of Canadians and, for now, U.S. citizens. ""As the virus continues its spread we've decided to take increasingly aggressive steps to keep you and your family safe,"" said Trudeau, who has been in self-isolation and working from home since last Thursday when his wife tested positive for the coronavirus. ""These measures will help save lives."" Trudeau said U.S. citizens are exempt from the ban because Canada's southern neighbor is in a category of its own. Canada will also strengthen travel restrictions in other areas. Trudeau said that, starting Thursday, international flights will only be permitted to land in four cities' airports: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. He said flights to Canada from the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean and Saint Pierre and Miquelon will be exempt from this rule. Airlines, he added, will be mandated to test all travelers and to prevent anyone showing symptoms of the virus from boarding a plane. The prime minister said Canadians returning home from abroad will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Earlier Monday, the Canada Border Services Agency added new questions for travelers arriving in Canada from all international destinations. The change, aimed at dealing with coronavirus fears, came amid confusion and criticism of the government’s airport screening process. Ontario Premier Doug Ford called on the federal government earlier Monday to tighten things up at the border. Ford also said he would support a federal government decision to shutter Canada's borders to visitors, including those from the United States, in response to the coronavirus. But Ford added that he would not want to see any closure to cross-border trade and commerce.","Trudeau: Canada to deny entry to all nonresidents except U.S. citizens, for now",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/canada-shuts-border-coronavirus-132332,politico

"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.  The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return. But since Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.  This will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump’s favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of “Fox & Friends” scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,” co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump’s administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus’ rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature “curvy couch” of the “Fox & Friends” set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored “the big plastic desk” one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio’s “fish bowl area.” “We’re doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don’t want to get infected and you don’t want to spread infection,” Doocy said. “We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Earhardt added. “And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.” The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. On-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was “actually the safest time to fly” despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of “overreacting” to the coronavirus. “It makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that,” Falwell said. “You know, impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico
"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and fewer than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  Among those surveyed, the president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than do not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, 49 percent to 44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy.”  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people; working or attending school from home whenever possible; and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. Its margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico
"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Pastelito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico
"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine's administration, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt backed by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an order from the state's top health official, Amy Acton, closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose insisted voters will still be able to vote. ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" DeWine said Monday. But DeWine's unprecedented order — closing physical polling places because an attempt to postpone the election failed — perplexed experts in election law. ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine said late Monday. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" A directive from LaRose to county elections officials late Monday night, following the polls closure, said the primary was postponed until June 2 and said counties are ""prohibited from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. ""There hasn't been an order to the Ohio secretary of state's office or to the governor's office that's been violated,"" LaRose told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday, arguing that state health officials acted within their jurisdiction. ""I serve as the chief elections officer for Ohio, and what I wanted to do was create certainty for Ohioans."" Ohio was one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced on Monday that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his Monday press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ... Election administrators have to be ready for anything. Except Godzilla.”  Natasha Korecki and Maggie Severns contributed to this report.","Ohio governor shutters polling places for Tuesday's primary, citing public health",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/ohio-governor-recommends-postponing-tuesdays-primary-132340,politico

"The government’s economic stimulus is set to quickly balloon into trillion-dollar territory in the coming days, the largest rescue in modern American history, as major industries flood the Trump administration and Capitol Hill for aid while huge swaths of the economy stall from the coronavirus crisis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans behind closed doors on Tuesday to present lawmakers with options for aid for airlines, hotels, casinos and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The White House was pushing for a package of more than $800 billion, POLITICO reported Monday, and on Tuesday the Treasury Department was preparing to unveil a package of $850 billion including more than $50 billion for the airline industry, $250 billion for small-business support and $500 billion for a payroll tax holiday. A senior administration official acknowledged the proposal could climb above that Tuesday by the time it’s unveiled.  Democrats are pushing their own package of provisions that don’t overlap entirely with the GOP pitch. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats are pitching a package of “at least” $750 billion that is expected to include more emergency aid for hospitals, expanded unemployment insurance, more funds for small business, help with child care, and food assistance for seniors. The size and scope of the package are morphing rapidly as the economic and market damage mounts. Senate Republicans and the White House are exploring how to fast-track existing legislation with the upcoming stimulus packages. The Trump administration’s goal is to provide sectors and companies with enough cash through emergency loans, tax deferrals or temporary tax cuts to help them survive the sudden downturn. The presentation is also expected to include an idea President Donald Trump has latched onto — a temporary cut or suspension of the payroll tax cut through the end of the year which would benefit both companies and workers. One version of the payroll tax holiday would cost $950 billion alone through the end of the year. CEOs, union leaders and lobbyists have been warning the administration of mass layoffs if the government does not help soon. Senators seem poised to act this week, while the House is still in recess. Cobbling together a stimulus package worth more than $1 trillion would mark a major ideological shift for Republicans, who spent years decrying debt and government bailouts following the 2008 global financial crisis. But with uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and the volatility in the stock market, the White House does not seem concerned about the price tag — only stopping the financial freefall. Other ideas that have circulated throughout the administration in recent days include inserting into the economic stimulus package a large-scale public works project; tweaks to the EB-5 visa program to boost foreign investment; tariff relief; and even a one-time cash payment to Americans between $500 to $750, according to people close to the administration.  The Federal Reserve and Treasury are already launching programs to provide support through emergency powers. The central bank on Tuesday announced a new lending program, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, under its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Treasury Department will provide taxpayer backing for the effort with $10 billion in capital from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.  “The economic disruption and uncertainty created by COVID-19 has created challenges for the commercial paper market, constraining access to short-term credit for American businesses,” Mnuchin said. “By providing short-term credit, the CPFF will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period.”  Some senior White House officials are also pushing Treasury to issue long-term bonds that would mature in 50 or 100 years to help cover the cost of the stimulus package. Mnuchin has said repeatedly in the past that he is considering issuing such bonds to take advantage of interest rates that the Fed has now pushed to near zero. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has long advocated for the issuance of such bonds, an idea also supported by outside economic advisers to the White House.  Republican Sen. Mitt Romney in recent days has called for giving every American over the age of 18 a check for $1,000 as a form of economic stimulus.  The coronavirus relief packages under consideration now by Congress are set to eclipse prior efforts.  The economic stimulus program cleared through Congress in early 2009 under the Obama administration was nearly $800 billion, including a tax cut, infrastructure and numerous other provisions. The bank bailout plan passed by Congress in 2008 under the Bush administration — formally the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP — authorized $700 billion originally intended to buy toxic assets from banks, mainly mortgage-backed securities that plunged in value during the housing crisis. The money was later diverted to multiple different programs to inject capital into banks. The TARP program ultimately disbursed around $426 billion and eventually recovered $441 billion, earning the Treasury Department a nominal profit of around $15 billion. That figure remains controversial. Taking into account inflation from the time of the bailouts, the government actually lost around $25 billion on the program.  It also generated widespread anger that banks and bankers got bailed out while ordinary citizens received far less. The Trump administration is well aware of this history and taking pains to avoid the same optics; top economic officials like Mnuchin and other senior aides around Trump keep emphasizing the need to help small and medium-sized businesses as well. “Everyone will need assistance and that is the bottom line. This is the demand issue because consumers have stopped spending,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a conservative-leaning group founded by entrepreneurs like The Home Depot founder, Bernie Marcus. “Every industry will need some level of assistance. In the past, Main Street America has not been as represented in some economic stimulus packages.”  Ortiz said he has been in touch directly with Mnuchin, who seems very amenable to including relief for small-to-medium-sized businesses in any package. The TARP program also drew widespread criticism for creating a moral hazard – banks could feel emboldened to take risks knowing the government would rescue them -- while creating fewer and even larger banks that now enjoyed a bigger federal backstop. Part of the reluctance among members of Congress and the administration to direct cash payments to individual industries like airlines and hotels stems from the TARP experience and deep voter resentment to corporations and their highly paid executives getting aid over regular citizens. Senior White House officials know that direct aid to airlines in particular may be necessary to avoid crippling bankruptcies, but they are leery of being seen as handing out bailouts and want to be sure that any such aid is dwarfed by proposals that would direct cash to consumers.  As top economic officials and Senate leadership negotiate this stimulus package, Trump is spending the day on the phone with executives from the restaurant and tourism industries, supply retailers and wholesalers. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with CEOs of major hotels including Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt and MGM Resorts International.

"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion. Nothing is set in stone, but the Washington Post reported that it will include around $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"President Donald Trump punched back on Tuesday against criticism from Democratic governors critical of his administration's coronavirus response, wading into his familiar political spats as the White House looks to combat a pandemic. Trump referred to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as the ""failing Michigan governor"" on Monday and lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after his calls for stepped up federal assistance. Minutes later, he heaped praise on his own administration for ""working very well with the Governors and State officials."" While Cuomo, Whitmer and other governors have been among the most vocal critics of the federal coronavirus response, they have been far from alone. The Trump administration has come under a steady drumbeat of scrutiny over its inability to quickly ramp up coronavirus testing capabilities as well as its weekslong rhetorical campaign to downplay the virus' threat to Americans. Only recently has the president reversed course in his own public utterances to warn the public about the severity of the pandemic's threat. The president's criticism of Whitmer on Tuesday appeared to be triggered by her appearance on MSNBC, where she said her state is working to flatten the curve by closing restaurants and bars after a federal government response that did not take the outbreak “seriously early enough.” She also outlined her plan to expand unemployment benefits as workers lose jobs and are forced to stay home amid the pandemic.  “The federal government did not take this seriously early enough, and now it is on us to make sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science available and that we are always putting the health of our people front and center,” Whitmer said on MSNBC. Trump soon after tweeted that the Michigan governor ""must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!” During a White House news briefing on Monday, the president also reportedly suggested that state leaders work to obtain medical equipment like respirators and ventilators on their own because of the slow federal process — a suggestion Whitmer called ""mind-boggling.""  “We need federal support. Like I said, we’re pulling out all the stops and reaching out to our partners in the private sector,” Whitmer said. “We’re going to do everything we can to supplement. But it’s not to the exclusion of federal support. We need the federal government to ramp up and to get this done.”  The president's feud with Cuomo, which bubbled up again Tuesday, has simmered for days amid back-and-forth criticism between the two men over the Trump administration's coronavirus response. The New York governor has repeatedly called for more federal help, to which Trump has replied that it is Cuomo who needs to do more. On Tuesday, the president accused Cuomo of playing politics with his criticism of the administration and suggested that a blanket federal policy of the type that some have called for would not be appropriate. ""Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,"" Trump tweeted, referring to the novel coronavirus by a controversial name that some in his administration have adopted. ""New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it.”  Trump ended his tirade against the governors with the tweet praising the federal government’s work with state and local officials, promising that “Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS.”",Trump lashes out at Dem governors amid coronavirus coordination,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-whitmer-cuomo-coronavirus-response-133716,politico
"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said Tuesday at a press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the Democratic process in our state.” But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus. “It is imperative that the people of the 7th Congressional District have a voice in the House of Representatives,” Hogan said.  “The State board of elections contacted us last Wednesday and said they were concerned about being able to conduct the election,'' Hogan said at his press conference. “They could not possibly do the mail-in for the whole state. They said they were incapable of getting it done in time ... but on a small basis in one congressional district for that one vacancy, we are going to ask the board of elections to conduct that election on time.  “We are going to encourage people to vote absentee as much as possible, and those who aren't doing the normal absentee ballot will be able to do whatever additional steps they decide to take for mail-in ballots,” Hogan continued. Hogan’s decision comes amid a national push from lawmakers, state officials and election law experts to allow anyone in the U.S. to cast their vote by mail in light of the public health crisis. Currently, 34 states and D.C. allow voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, and millions of voters still have to queue up in person on Election Day — an activity that blatantly violates new federal guidance against gathering in groups of 10 or more people, as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pointed out Monday when calling for the postponement of his state's primary. While advocates have unsuccessfully called for the adoption of universal vote-by-mail for decades, they’re hoping the coronavirus pandemic serves as a wakeup call.  “In the 15 years I’ve been pushing this, we’ve never had a public health and safety argument for this. Now, we do,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the lead author of a federal vote-by-mail bill, told POLITICO. “Now, for states to say they don’t have a fallback plan and they’re just going to cancel or delay elections – that's not acceptable when we’re in the middle of the pandemic.” Last week, Wyden introduced a retooled version of his decades-old bill targeted for situations like the coronavirus pandemic. He’s currently in the process of convincing fellow senators to support it, and pushing for it to be included in one of the upcoming relief packages Congress is currently putting together.  Under the legislation, if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency, all states have to offer universal vote-by-mail for one election cycle, and the federal government will provide $500 million to make sure pre-paid, self-sealing envelopes are distributed so that voters aren’t spreading germs or having to pay out of pocket.  Even without a federal mandate, Wyden says, the move towards vote by mail is already accelerating in red and blue states alike.  “States are already moving in this direction because people are saying, ‘What other options is there?’” he said. Maryland will likely not be the last state to postpone its primaries. Hogan said “other governors are expected to do” the same “later today, or the days ahead.” A spokesperson for Hogan tweeted that “we expect other Acela states to take similar steps.” The April 28 primary was informally referred to as the Acela Primary, because the states voting that day are connected by the popular Amtrak line. Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are all scheduled to vote on April 28; none of them have modified their primaries as of yet.","Maryland postpones primary, shifts special election to mail voting over coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776,politico
"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.   The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return.   But since some Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.   Another concern for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans is a practical one — if they let the Senate adjourn following passage of the ""Phase 2"" House bill, it may be logistically difficult to get senators back to Washington once they go home because of travel hurdles. Airline service has been severely disrupted so far, and situation may worsen. In addition, if one or more senators contract the virus, returning to Washington may prove impossible.  But the idea of combing two stimulus packages will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.   The White House Tuesday morning began signaling it was aiming for $850 billion in stimulus spending, split between a payroll tax cut, support for the airline industry and $250 billion in loans for small business.   ""I don’t know how it happens exactly yet. I know that 'Phase Two' will kind of be the baseline approach and then we’ll try and go from there,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) on Tuesday.   ""There’s a third iteration that we’re working on and how it gets across the floor and back to the House remains to be seen. I mean they could move separately, but maybe there’s a way we combine it,” he said.   The House passed the $100 billion-plus ""Phase 2"" stimulus bill on late Friday night, but then had to amend the package Monday with significant ""technical corrections"" following discussions between Mnuchin, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).   The revised legislation — which provides paid sick days and emergency leave to workers who are ill or have family members with coronavirus — is set to be taken up the Senate this week.   Several senior Democratic aides said combining the two packages into one would be a nonstarter in the House without significant concessions.  House Democratic leaders are already dealing with rank-and-file anger over a “technical corrections” bill the House passed late Monday that actually included a significant rewrite to the paid leave language in a major concession to the White House.  The change — which would allow more businesses to seek exemptions from offering their employees paid leave — was pushed by administration officials as necessary to get the bill through the Senate, according to multiple sources. But now, if the House-passed bill is combined with a huge economic package, they didn’t even need to make that major change, House Democratic aides argued.  In addition, several Democrats said the payroll tax cut was still a nonstarter, citing tepid support for the idea even among Republicans. And they threw cold water on the idea of just cutting checks to people, saying the bureaucracy needed to implement such a massive program could delay payments for weeks if not longer.  “All this stuff can come together fairly quickly,” said one Democrat involved in the negotiations. “The question is what are ideas that can come together fairly quickly? Something new like direct payments to people isn’t feasible.”  Democratic aides said they were instead looking at other ways to pad people’s wallets by expanding credits already written into the tax code.",White House eyes combining House bill with new coronavirus stimulus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/white-house-senate-republicans-coronavirus-aid-133732,politico
"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump’s favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of “Fox & Friends” scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,” co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays 6-9 a.m. Eastern and has achieved outsize influence under Trump’s administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend Americans maintain a distance of 6 feet to help thwart the coronavirus’ rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the show's signature “curvy couch.""  Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored “the big plastic desk” one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed behind a lectern in the studio’s “fish bowl area.” “We’re doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don’t want to get infected and you don’t want to spread infection,” Doocy said. “We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Earhardt added. “And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.” The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the coronavirus threat after being dismissive of its risk to Americans. On-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. ast On Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was “actually the safest time to fly” despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of “overreacting” to the novel coronavirus. “It makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that,” Falwell said. “You know, impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico
"There’s an easy way to tell that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a bad deal on the bipartisan coronavirus response bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. It’s not the liberal complaints that she let the White House limit paid sick leave to about one-fifth of U.S. workers. It’s not the Republican complaints that the bill doesn’t provide tax relief and cash for businesses and individuals hurt by the pandemic. It’s not even the general consensus that this initial legislation will need to be followed up by a much more aggressive economic stimulus bill. No, the easy way to tell Pelosi negotiated a bad deal for Democrats is that she negotiated a deal at all—rather than dictating the terms and telling President Donald Trump to take them or leave them. The lesson of the last congressional response to an economic emergency, President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill, is that when a president desperately needs legislation to address a crisis, anyone with the power to stop him can decide what’s in it. When Obama took office, in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Democrats controlled the House and Senate as well. But they needed 60 votes to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and there were only 57 Democratic senators, which meant Obama had to recruit three Republicans to vote for a stimulus bill. In just his second week in office, his blunt-spoken chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had to pose a blunt-spoken question to Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania: Whaddya want? Specter’s ask was simple, and by Washington horse-trading standards, noble. He wanted $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Then he would vote for the Obama stimulus. “Are you f---ing kidding me?” Emanuel exploded. Emanuel assumed $10 billion-with-a-b was just Specter’s initial bid, a shock-tactic negotiating ploy. But Specter gruffly said no, that was his final offer, take it or leave it. “What the f--- does a vote cost around here?” Emanuel screamed. In Specter’s case, it cost precisely $10 billion. He understood that Obama needed his vote to fix the economy, so he held all the leverage. But today’s congressional Democrats don’t seem to understand that at all. Right now, after initially downplaying the threat of coronavirus, then bungling the response to the pandemic, then watching the swift demise of the bull market he had hailed as proof of his leadership, Trump absolutely needs congressional action to limit the public health disaster and mitigate the economic damage on his watch. House Democrats can pass whatever bill they want, and if Republicans aren’t willing to go along with it, another lesson of American crisis politics is that it’s Trump who will suffer the consequences. Some Democrats have fretted that they might suffer politically if they don’t help Trump clean up the mess, but the opposite happened in 2009. The Republican minority in the House unanimously refused to support Obama’s stimulus, even though the crisis had exploded on his Republican predecessor’s watch, and the very next year those same Republicans took back the majority in the House. In fact, the only Republican in Congress who paid a political price was Specter, who had to switch to the Democratic Party after a GOP backlash over his vote for Obama’s stimulus, and ended up losing his seat anyway. In 2020, Democrats are not acting like a party with that kind of leverage. Instead, Pelosi frantically hashed out a compromise on Friday over 13 phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accepted Democratic proposals to expand free COVID-19 testing and unemployment benefits, along with a modest boost in food aid for the poor, but made it clear that permanent legislation mandating universal sick leave was a “non-starter” for Republicans. Trump ratcheted up the pressure by complaining publicly that Democrats weren’t “giving enough” in the negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the House proposals as “an ideological wish list.” Ultimately, Democrats accepted a temporary mandate that applies only to companies smaller than 500 employees, and allows companies smaller than 50 employees to seek exemptions.  “Democrats preferred to have something rather than nothing,” a Democratic source explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That was the choice we faced.” That was not the choice Democrats faced. Unlike the Republicans in 2009, who only had a filibuster-proof minority in the Senate, they also have a majority in the House, where they could have attached anything they wanted to the must-pass coronavirus testing and dared Republicans to say no.  If the president was unwilling to approve measures to help contain a pandemic and limit the economic fallout because he didn’t want sick workers to be guaranteed paid leave, he could have explained that to the public. He’s the president, the head of state, the “I alone can fix it” guy. He’s the one who will be judged by the outcome of the crisis that he initially insisted was not a crisis, then declared was under control thanks to his leadership. After all, Obama was held responsible for an economic crisis that erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, and the party that fought his efforts to fix the crisis ended up taking back the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. The public doesn’t follow the details of legislation on Capitol Hill, but it blames presidents for bad outcomes. The public also tends to blame presidents for partisan paralysis, while giving them credit for bipartisan cooperation; that’s why McConnell understood he could make Obama look partisan by fighting him, even though Obama’s stimulus was stuffed with tax cuts and other Republican priorities. It is true that Democrats would be accused of trying to exploit the crisis if they tried to load up a coronavirus bill with unrelated priorities such as, say, a “Green New Deal” to fight the climate crisis—although it’s worth noting that Trump and McConnell have already accused them of trying to exploit the crisis just for trying to mandate sick leave during a pandemic. But they still have the leverage to shape legislation just about any way they want if they’re willing to take the heat. In 2009, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine used her leverage to demand that the Obama stimulus include a technical fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax that added $70 billion to the price tag while providing virtually no economic stimulus. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine insisted on stripping a school construction initiative out of Obama’s stimulus—along with, ironically, an $870 million line item for pandemic preparedness. The 57 Democrats in the Senate also had the power to extract concessions for their votes; Obama had wanted a stimulus without congressional earmarks, but Dick Durbin of Illinois managed to include one for a $1 billion carbon-capture plant that never ended up getting built. Setting aside the question of whether Democrats should try to exploit the leverage to advance long-term policy priorities, they can absolutely exploit their leverage to address the short-term crisis. If they think universal sick leave will help, they should demand universal sick leave. Meanwhile, with Louisiana and Georgia already postponing primaries over the virus, why shouldn’t Democrats attach provisions guaranteeing that Americans will be able to vote by mail in November? Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, doesn’t understand why the Democrats didn’t insist on provisions restoring congressional oversight powers to help them ride herd on the administration’s response to the virus, ensuring that Trump and his aides can no longer defy subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Again, if Trump thinks it’s so important to prevent Americans from voting by mail and preventing Congress from overseeing his administration that he would block measures to accelerate the pandemic testing that his own team has botched, he can try to convince the public. “House Democrats don’t have some leverage,” Hauser says. “They have complete leverage.” By giving Trump the emergency measures that he needs most without insisting on the worker protections that Democrats wanted most, Pelosi has sacrificed some of that leverage. She has also helped the president look like a bipartisan consensus-builder, while essentially confirming the GOP talking point that Democrats have a responsibility to meet Trump’s demands in order to avoid a partisan stalemate. In 2009, Republicans simply ignored all the pundits warning that they would pay a huge political price for refusing to help the first black president fix an economic mess he had inherited—and the pundits turned out to be wrong. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders argue that it’s their duty to help Trump save lives and jobs in 2020, even though Republicans didn’t help Obama in 2009, even though Trump routinely calls them traitors, even though an economic downturn could doom his reelection. They’re pro-government people; they’re not inclined to stand in the way of government action during a crisis. When the Great Recession was just getting started in January 2008, Pelosi negotiated a quick bipartisan stimulus bill with Bush’s Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, and within months Americans were receiving $1,000 checks from the federal government. It’s an honorable approach, even though it also probably reduces Pelosi’s leverage. It’s hard to win a game of chicken when the other driver knows you’re committed to avoiding a crash. Once Trump signs this emergency response bill, he’ll start clamoring for a much larger economic stimulus bill loaded with tax cuts for airlines, cruise lines, his own hospitality industry and other Republican-friendly businesses, along with payroll tax cuts that can help get him reelected. And Democrats will find that many of the same Republicans who mocked the idea of using taxpayer dollars to stimulate the private economy as Big Government when Obama was in the White House—even though they had supported that bipartisan stimulus bill under Bush—will rediscover the attraction of Keynesian economics when it suits their party’s interests. Democrats will have to decide whether to meet Trump in the middle, or whether to risk the obstructionist label by holding out for what they want in a time of economic pain. They will also have to decide exactly what it is they want. Some of Obama’s top economists have publicly called for Congress to send checks to American citizens, which would help the economy and also Trump’s reelection prospects. Again, that’s honorable and responsible, especially since Trump is sure to denounce the Democrats as obstructionists no matter what happens, but it’s not clear it squares with Democratic rhetoric about the danger of Trump’s reelection, especially if they don’t get anything in exchange for helping to rescue the sinking Trump economy. In any case, Trump won’t be able to pass a stimulus bill without them. At a minimum, one thing they can demand for their cooperation is legislative assurance that economic stimulus can no longer be something that happens routinely only under Republican presidents. They should insist on more robust “automatic stabilizers” so that any time the economy craters, no matter who’s in the White House, Washington will automatically spend far more on food stamps, unemployment insurance and other aid to vulnerable families, and perhaps automatically roll back payroll taxes and other economic burdens. That way, members of Congress will no longer have the power to take the economy hostage during crises. For now, though, Democrats absolutely have that power. They need to choose their ransom wisely.",Pelosi Has Trump Over a Barrel,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-stimulus-132388,politico
"Much of American public life is at a standstill. But not the Democratic presidential race — not yet at least. While some future voting has been postponed because of the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus across the U.S., primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois are still on for Tuesday. Polling places in Ohio, which was set to vote Tuesday, have been closed down by public health officials after the governor pushed to delay the primary amid the public health crisis. Despite that, think of the vote as Super Tuesday, Jr.: The 441 delegates up for grabs in the three states still voting today makes it the third-largest delegate haul on the calendar, behind only March 3 and the slate of primaries planned for April 28. But between the coronavirus beginning to ravage the nation, the unprecedented, widespread closures that have shuttered public spaces across the country and Joe Biden’s now-commanding lead over Bernie Sanders — in polls released on the eve of the March 17 contests, Biden holds double-digit leads across all four states — the primaries are flying below the radar for many Americans. Last week, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio rejected calls to postpone Tuesday’s primaries, saying that they would make accommodations, including extending early voting hours, to prevent large crowds from gathering. But on Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a court in Columbus for a last-minute postponement of the primary. When the court refused, saying it was too late to postpone, the state’s health department ordered the polling places shuttered — despite a lack of clarity about how, or even if, voters might be able to cast ballots in the primary. The Ohio Supreme Court later effectively upheld the decision to close the polls. Here’s a state-by-state look at the map for Tuesday: Democrats are hoping that Tuesday’s presidential primary is the springboard to flipping Arizona in November. President Donald Trump won the state by just 4 points in 2016, and polls conducted there show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both competitive against Trump in the general election. Arizona will likely be the closest of the four states voting on Tuesday, according to pre-election polls. But Biden still holds a double-digit lead over Sanders in poll after poll — despite Sanders’ enduring, though not overwhelming, advantage among Latino voters. Hillary Clinton defeated Sanders in Arizona four years ago, 56 percent to 41 percent, and carried all nine of the state’s congressional districts. Polls suggest Biden is on pace for a similar victory, barring a surprise. The state is going ahead with its primary despite the coronavirus outbreak. Many voters cast their ballots by mail, but there is still significant disruption. In Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix and is home to roughly 60 percent of registered voters — most polling places are closed for safety reasons. Instead, the county is operating about 150 vote centers on Tuesday, where voters can cast their ballots regardless of where they live within the county. Bernie Sanders was blown out by Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 — and his prospects are no more promising in 2020. Polls show Joe Biden with a 2- or 3-to-1 advantage over Sanders, whose lack of support from older Democrats makes him particularly ill-suited for a state that is a magnet for retirees from the eastern third of the nation. Moreover, Sanders’ advantage with Latino voters in other states doesn’t translate to Florida, where many Hispanics are either immigrants or descend from immigrants from Caribbean and Latin American countries whose leftist leaders they despise. Polls show Sanders, who has praised some of the actions of those authoritarian governments, trailing Biden among Hispanic voters in Florida. The state has shuttered and consolidated a number of polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak. The state Democratic Party on Monday identified 91 precincts that were closed after GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered elections officials not to house polling places in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. But DeSantis resisted calls to reschedule the presidential primaries. “We’re definitely voting,” he told reporters in Tallahassee last Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Polls close in virtually all of Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern — but remain open an hour later in portions of the Panhandle in the Central Time Zone. Bernie Sanders had the Democratic establishment on edge four years ago when he stormed out of Michigan victorious and nearly beat Hillary Clinton in her home state of Illinois a week later. But in 2020, neighboring Michigan delivered a 16-point rout for Biden and has deflated the Vermont senator’s campaign here. Mike Bloomberg had started to make inroads here but when he, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar folded their campaigns, most of their moderate supporters — and their donors — joined the Biden camp. Gov. J.B. Pritzker also delivered his endorsement to Biden on primary eve. A WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last week showed Biden leading Sanders by 20 percentage points among likely voters in Illinois. Sanders recently rallied in Chicago with Rep. Chuy Garcia and other local Latino officials to help shore up his support. But the cloud hanging over the Tuesday primary is the coronavirus outbreak. Schools have been ordered closed and polling stations are being moved out of senior centers as the number of cases tick up, so it’s unclear what voter turnout will look like. The saga of Ohio’s primary adds significant uncertainty to a race that otherwise seems one-sided. Joe Biden led Bernie Sanders in the latest poll by 23 points — in a state Hillary Clinton carried by 13 points four years ago, winning all but 15 of the state’s 88 counties. Gov. Mike DeWine’s Monday night order closing the polling places came only about eight hours before they were set to open. DeWine said Secretary of State Frank LaRose would petition the courts “to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.” But it’s unclear how that opportunity would be extended, or when. The ambiguity extends beyond the presidential race. Ohio was set to hold all its primaries for the 2020 elections on Tuesday, including for Congress and state Legislature.",How to watch Tuesday’s primaries like a pro,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-to-watch-tuesdays-primaries-133318,politico
"For the second time in two years, Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the last members of a dwindling breed of conservative House Democrats who oppose abortion rights — is at risk of losing his seat in a primary. The Illinois lawmaker faces a rematch Tuesday against Marie Newman, a progressive upstart who nearly unseated him in 2018. But what should have been the left’s clearest shot yet at the incumbent is mired in uncertainty, with high-profile progressives distracted by Sen. Bernie Sanders's floundering presidential campaign and the election itself enveloped by the coronavirus crisis. Both camps are at a loss for how to handicap the race. “I personally don’t know,” said Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster working with Lipinski. “You love to say you’re a guru about these things, but there’s too many things we don’t know the answer to.” Lipinski is liberals' highest-profile 2020 primary target. Lining up behind Newman are Sanders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats.  Ousting him would be a much-needed victory for these progressives who have struggled to recapture the magic of 2018, including Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of a leading House Democrat, amid a series of roadblocks throughout the primary season. Their latest loss came on Super Tuesday, when Jessica Cisneros, a liberal challenger boosted by the Justice Democrats, failed to oust a moderate Democrat in South Texas. Other progressive Senate candidates also fell short in primaries in Texas and North Carolina. Lipinski's primary may have been their best chance for victory— before the coronavirus outbreak. Newman began March with clear momentum: She was outspending the incumbent on TV 2-1, and Lipinski supporters were nervous enough that they had begun urging Republican-leaning voters to pull a Democratic ballot and cast it for the incumbent. The biggest question mark now is turnout. Both campaigns are operating under the assumption that it could be at a historic low, with leaders, including Illinois' governor, urging citizens to be cautious about venturing into public spaces. Lipinski admitted in an interview last week he is combating a lot of unknowns. “We’ll see where the presidential primary is,” he told reporters in the Capitol. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, don’t know what the coronavirus — what impact that could have. So, just wait and see.” The Newman campaign has urged supporters to vote early, is prioritizing phone banking and has canceled its election night party. Both teams could make a plausible case that low turnout is to their benefit, depending on the age and ideology of who shows up. Lipinski’s team thinks he could have an edge with older voters, who tend to be more reliable and may be more likely to go to the polls. Yet the coronavirus disproportionately affects those 60 and older and public health officials urged elderly people to remain in their homes as much as possible. Other liberal challengers, such Ocasio-Cortez, have won low-turnout races in which the electorate is smaller and more ideological. The 2018 midterms brought roughly presidential-level primary turnout, and Newman came within 2,200 votes of ousting Lipinski. Though a new policy by the House Democratic campaign arm that blacklists consultants who work with primary challengers cost her some top campaign talent, Newman said she feels better prepared this cycle. “As you can imagine, your first time, out you learn a lot. And I did. And there’s things that I didn’t do well,"" she told reporters in a phone call last week.  Now ""we have an amazing voter outreach program,"" she said. ""I started fundraising a lot earlier this time.” Her campaign, she said, has knocked on more than 110,000 doors and made 90,000 phone calls. She had outraised Lipinski by more than $400,000 as of late February, and that contrast is shown particularly stark on television. Newman has spent about $900,000 on television advertising, while Lipinski has dropped less than $450,000, according to an analysis obtained by POLITICO. Plus, a coalition of abortion rights groups, including EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Planned Parenthood, has dropped about $1 million in TV ads knocking Lipinski. And outside allies who spent for Lipinski in 2018, such as the bipartisan group No Labels, have largely stayed out this cycle, leaving a stark disparity. “She’s got significantly more independent-expenditure resources than she had last time, and we have significantly less,” said Dave Heller, a media consultant for Lipinski, “which is the only reason why we’re worried.” Lipinski is reviled by the liberal wing of the party for a slew of positions and votes that range from his support for defunding Planned Parenthood to his 2010 opposition to the Affordable Care Act. He is now notably running an ad touting his efforts to protect that law and attacking Newman for supporting a single-payer health care plan. Still, Newman has centered her campaign on other issues like reducing gun violence and making health care affordable. She supports ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal."" Lipinski has pitched himself as more in line with the district and suggests Newman is too extreme: ""We should remain focused on what’s important. What really holds us all together as Democrats: the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress."" Yet there’s evidence to suggest his allies are leaning on independent and Republican voters to boost him in the Democratic primary. An internal campaign strategy document accidentally leaked in November suggested “GOP surrogates” could help Lipinski court Republican voters. Then this weekend, a Newman volunteer received what appeared to be an automated text message mobilizing GOP-leaning voters to ""stop"" Newman and Cook County (Ill.) prosecutor Kim Foxx."" Asked last week about the possibility of courting Republican voters — Illinois doesn't have party registration, so voters can pull whichever party's primary ballot they request — Lipinski said it was not the focus of his outreach but suggested he would take their support. “I think it’s good to have more people vote in the Democratic primary, bring them into the Democratic Party,” he said. Lipinski was first elected in 2004, after his father, then-Rep. Bill Lipinski, announced his surprise retirement and persuaded the state Democratic Party to nominate his son to replace him on that fall's ballot. The younger Lipinski could benefit from Chicago machine politics that boosted him and his father in the past. He will need to run up the margins in the Chicago part of the district, as he did two years ago, while Newman is banking on support in the southwest suburbs. A win by Newman on Tuesday would bring a surge of energy to progressives disheartened by a stinging loss earlier this month against Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, who also opposes abortion.  Cuellar and his fellow moderates have hailed his victory over Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, as an indicator that their caucus is still a big-tent party. “It bodes well for moderates and centrists,” said Cuellar, who said he had discussed his race with Lipinski. “A lot of members were very happy I won because they felt that, if I would have lost, then that would have created a momentum.” Sanders’ dismal performance in recent primaries has relieved some Lipinski supporters, who worried Sanders could drive out young and more left-leaning voters out to the polls, and that they would be more likely to support Newman. Interviewed last week at the Capitol as the House scrambled to cobble together a program to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, some top progressives suggested they had not been closely monitoring Lipinksi’s race or were otherwise preoccupied. ""Obviously, I’ve been very busy with the Sanders campaign,” said California Rep. Ro Khanna a top Sanders surrogate. “But I’m supportive of her; we did some fundraising for her.” “I don’t know any of the day-to-day detail stuff,” said Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Newman, when asked if he were following the race. The scaling back of large gatherings precluded any kind of final-weekend rally with big-name headliners like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez — though it’s unclear whether any would have materialized without the outbreak. Neither campaigned for Cisneros in South Texas. “I was always a little bit worried about this dynamic,” said Sean McElwee, the founder of liberal think tank Data for Progress. “The extent to which the top of the ticket was going to swamp out interest in the down-ticket stuff was always a danger for these primary challengers this cycle.”","This anti-abortion rights, Obamacare-opposing House Democrat is in trouble",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/dan-lipinski-primary-133226,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the Washington state primary, keeping a lead over progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to The Associated Press.

Washington votes entirely by mail-in ballots.  Biden secured victories in all states except North Dakota, which went to Sanders. His Washington win continues a surge for the former vice president that initially started with a rocky trail behind Sanders.  Biden won by more than 21,000 of the over 2 million votes cast, according to the AP. Though 13 candidates were on the ballot, Biden and Sanders were the main candidates after a litany of prominent Democrats — including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — dropped out of the race.

"Seven days before Donald Trump took office, his aides faced a major test: the rapid, global spread of a dangerous virus in cities like London and Seoul, one serious enough that some countries were imposing travel bans.  In a sober briefing, Trump’s incoming team learned that the disease was an emerging pandemic — a strain of novel influenza known as H9N2 — and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. “Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,” Trump’s aides were told. Soon, they heard cases were popping up in California and Texas. The briefing was intended to hammer home a new, terrifying reality facing the Trump administration, and the incoming president’s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe, this 2017 crisis didn’t really happen — it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump’s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama.  And in the words of several attendees, the atmosphere was “weird” at best, chilly at worst. POLITICO obtained documents from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed-door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics, and top officials from both sides — whether they wanted to be there or not — were forced to confront a whole-of-government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges, such as shortages of ventilators, anti-viral drugs and other medical essentials, and that having a coordinated, unified national response was “paramount” — warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the administration. That extraordinary turnover in the months and years that followed is likely one reason his administration has struggled to handle the very real pandemic it faces now, former Obama administration officials said. “The advantage we had under Obama was that during the first four years we had the same White House staff, the same Cabinet,” said former deputy labor secretary Chris Lu, who attended the gathering. “Just having the continuity makes all the difference in the world.” Sean Spicer, Trump’s first White House press secretary, was among those who participated in the meeting. He said he understood the reasons such exercises could be useful, but described the encounter as a massive transfer of information that ultimately felt very theoretical. In real life, things are never as simple as what’s presented in a table-top exercise, he said. “There’s no briefing that can prepare you for a worldwide pandemic,” added Spicer, who left the administration in mid-2017. The outgoing Obama aides and incoming Trump aides gathered for roughly three hours on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. At least 30 representatives of Trump’s team — many of them soon-to-be Cabinet members — were present, each sitting next to their closest Obama administration counterpart. Incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to keep dozing off. Incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry was getting along famously with Ernest Moniz, the man he was replacing, several fellow participants said.  But it was clear some on the Trump team had barely, if ever, spoken with the people they were replacing. News had broken that same day about national security adviser Michael Flynn’s unusual contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, so his presence in the meeting added to the surrealness. Some members of both groups kept going in and out of the room, but most paid quiet attention to the presentations, which were led by top Obama aides. Obama aides, in op-eds and essays ripping the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, have pointed to the Jan. 13, 2017, session as a key example of their effort to press the importance of pandemic preparedness to their successors. In a Friday op-ed, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, blasted Trump for comments such as “you can never really think” that a pandemic like the coronavirus “is going to happen.” She mentioned the 2017 session as one of many instances of the Obama administration’s efforts to help its successor be ready for such a challenge. She also slammed the Trump team for dismantling the National Security Council section that would play a lead role in organizing the U.S. response to a global pandemic. “Rather than heed the warnings, embrace the planning and preserve the structures and budgets that had been bequeathed to him, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic,” Rice wrote. (Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who oversaw the dissolution of the NSC’s global health security and biodefense section, has defended it as necessary streamlining, countering that global health “remained a top NSC priority.” Trump, when recently asked about the reshuffling, called the question “nasty” and said, “I don’t know anything about it.”) Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, explained the thinking behind the January 2017 session in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs. “Although the exercise was required, the specific scenarios we chose were not,” she wrote. “We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.” None of the sources argued that one meeting three years ago could have dramatically altered events today. But Obama aides say the Trump administration’s fumbling of the coronavirus outbreak is partly rooted in how unprepared — and in some cases unwilling — it was to engage in transition exercises at all in late 2016 and early 2017. David Shulkin, who was an Obama appointee at the time but had been nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary in the Trump administration, said in an interview that with the exception of this exercise, which he didn’t recall well, he noticed that in his agency, there had been “little coordination” and “very little interest in working with the Obama appointees.”  “They had said we don’t really have a lot of need to talk to the Obama appointees,” he said. That botched handoff sparked weeks of confusion, all the way up to Inauguration Day. “There was a frenzy before the transition where I was asked to consider staying because the [preparedness] mission was so important,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as Obama’s Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, where she worked on crises like the Ebola virus outbreak and attended the pandemic exercise. “Then through the HHS secretary’s office, the next day, I heard they changed their mind.” The Trump campaign, like the rest of America, was shocked to win the November 2016 election. Soon afterward, Trump cast aside his team’s transition prep work that had happened already and started over; some of his aides described tossing carefully collected binders full of possible personnel picks into trash bins. It was days, sometimes weeks, before his nominees and their aides showed up to meet the people they were replacing — if they did so at all — or to engage in transition meetings. Obama aides said they left detailed memos for their successors, but that quite often it appeared those memos were never read. Many on the Obama side were genuinely surprised that so many actually showed up for the Jan. 13, 2017, exercise, and there were expectations that some would skip it. On the Obama side, several agencies were represented by their second-in-command at the meeting for reasons including a belief that Trump’s principals wouldn’t show. The gathering was held to satisfy a requirement in a 2016 law that updated the procedures around presidential transitions to require, among other things, that the outgoing administration “prepare and host interagency emergency preparedness and response exercises.” Obama also mentioned it in a 2016 executive order laying out his transition goals. The 2016 law came about at the urging of the Partnership for Public Service, a good-government organization that helps administrations and candidates with the transition process. The emergency preparedness provisions were inspired by how George W. Bush handled his transition to Obama; that process, regarded as the gold standard for transition planning, included joint exercises on how to react to improvised explosive devices in cities. Bush had insisted on a detailed and highly coordinated transition planning in part because he felt scarred by the rushed transition he’d experienced from the Bill Clinton administration, not to mention having to deal with the Sept. 11 attacks during his first year. “The idea was hatched after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina precisely to prepare for situations like today,” said David Marchick, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition.  The Obama and Trump teams met in the afternoon, sitting around tables arranged in a rectangle. Participants were given a binder of unclassified materials titled “Presidential Transition Exercise Series,” the contents of which were obtained by POLITICO. The purpose of the exercise, the documents state, was to “familiarize” the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices and continuity of government programs” in case it faced a major crisis. One key goal was to explain to participants the various legal authorities they had to pursue a response, and which agencies had which capabilities and responsibilities. The references provided included detailed explanations of numerous laws and regulations that might affect their work, such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Aside from the H9N2 pandemic exercise, the participants discussed the case study of how the Obama administration handled Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One section covered a potential cyber incident. Another went through how to respond to a domestic terrorism incident, in this case one carried out by a group of U.S. citizens who placed bombs in nearby spots during a major sporting event in a U.S. city. The terror squad not only detonates the bombs, it also engages in a mass shooting and takes a dozen hostages. Using the materials, Monaco led the discussion. Her incoming counterpart, Tom Bossert, acted as a “semi co-chair,” attendees said. Ross, the then 79-year-old incoming Commerce secretary, was spotted with his eyes closed on more than one occasion. Elaine Chao, tapped to run the Department of Transportation, paid close attention. Several attendees noted the tense body language between Rice and Flynn, who lasted only a few weeks as Trump’s national security adviser and was ousted amid questions over his dealings with Russian officials. And then there was the Energy Department duo: Perry, the incoming secretary who previously served as the governor of Texas, and Moniz, the outgoing secretary and famed physicist. The pair seemed to get along fabulously, which stood out to other attendees given the overall distrust between the two teams and the fact that Perry had once proposed getting rid of the Energy Department altogether. It was a “semi-bizarro lovefest” between the two, a fellow participant said. “They were ready to go make a buddy movie.”  Perry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, Moniz, who now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, said, “It is correct that [Perry] and I offered relevant perspectives from a governor’s and Cabinet secretary’s seat, respectively. As governor of Texas for a long time, Perry had been through many episodes needing crisis management.” For the most part, however, the Trump team was in receive mode.  Partly, that was not a surprise: Many of Trump’s personnel choices had little or no government experience, and the Obama aides were presenting massive troves of information to them about how a raft of agencies had to work together to respond to various crises. Multiple current and former Trump officials reached by POLITICO said they did not recall much about the briefing. But some Obama aides who attended said they were left with the impression that many of the Trump aides showed up to simply check off a box more than to learn. The impression was boosted in part because the transition overall was going so poorly. Several Trump nominees had barely even spoken to their Obama counterparts.  The State Department representative at the meeting, for instance, was Tom Shannon, a veteran career foreign service officer serving as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Shannon attended instead of Secretary of State John Kerry in part because he would be staying on under Trump and was essentially the “transition designee.” But that Jan. 13, 2017, session was the first time he’d seen the incoming secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in person since Trump picked him for the job a month earlier. (Before the inauguration, Kerry and Tillerson spoke once, by phone, for a few minutes, people familiar with the situation said.) “The problem is that they came in very arrogant and convinced that they knew more than the outgoing administration — full swagger,” one former Obama administration official who attended said.  “There were people who were there who said, ‘This is really stupid and why do we need to be here,’” added another senior Obama administration official who attended, alleging that Ross and incoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were especially dismissive in conversations on the sidelines of the session. “But some Trump people, like Tom Bossert, were trying to take it seriously.” Asked for comment, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for DeVos, told POLITICO: “This is nothing more than a hit piece with no basis in reality. This department, under the secretary’s leadership, has taken swift action to support students, parents, and education leaders during this pandemic and will continue to do so. This former Obama official’s wild claims don’t comport with reality.” A Commerce Department spokesperson denied that Ross had dozed off. ""Secretary Ross found the meeting quite interesting and informative, taking many notes during the exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He continues to rely upon that knowledge and experience as he assists the president in confronting the crisis at hand."" Another participant noted that such exercises are primarily aimed at helping an incoming administration make it through the first several months of its tenure — “the idea being, of course, that during the transition period we’re uniquely vulnerable.”  Presumably, by the third or fourth year in power, the administration would have its own processes and muscle memory, the participant said. Asked whether information about the pandemic exercise reached the president-elect, a former senior Trump administration official who attended the meeting couldn’t say for sure but noted that it wasn’t “the kind of thing that really interested the president very much.”  “He was never interested in things that might happen. He’s totally focused on the stock market, the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit,” the person said. “The possibility things were things he didn’t spend much time on or show much interest in. “Even though we would put time on the schedule for things like that, if they happened at all, they would be very, very brief,” the former official continued. “To get the president to be focused on something like this would be quite hard.”  Anything associated with Obama or his administration was also a no-go zone for Trump aides. If you brought them up, “that would be an immediate rejection, like, ‘Why are they even here? Why the fuck did you ask them?’” Ben Lefebvre contributed to this report.","Before Trump’s inauguration, a warning: ‘The worst influenza pandemic since 1918’",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797,politico
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is facing pressure from inside and outside the State Department to be more forthcoming about the coronavirus’s effect on its 75,000 employees around the world.  Pompeo is expected to address the pandemic during a press conference Tuesday afternoon. The illness is forcing U.S. diplomats to scramble to help Americans affected overseas while also concerning them for their own safety.  The department has said it is aware of reports that least one U.S. embassy employee, in Jamaica, has contracted the COVID-19 virus, but has divulged little else. A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, told POLITICO there are several other confirmed cases at posts overseas, but none yet in Washington. State Department spokespeople have not offered comment. Frustration with State’s handling of the issue is growing both internally and externally. Lawmakers and staffers are raising questions about why Pompeo has not been more up front about his workforce’s cases of the virus, while also expressing concerns about a lack of uniform guidance from Pompeo on how employees should adjust their work habits.  The department “has not put forth a coordinated, robust response, which I fear puts the health of its own employees at further risk, and further jeopardizes the health and well-being of the American people,” Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Pompeo dated Monday.  Eric Rubin, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the diplomats’ union, also called for transparency. “We would urge that the administration share all information that is available so that our people have a clear sense of what the dangers are and what they need to do to be safe,” he said.  Some State Department staffers privately complain that they’ve not heard more from Pompeo directly on the issue. The internal messaging has been delegated largely to other top State Department officials, who have essentially told various bureau leaders and ambassadors to issue their own guidance to their staffers on whether to work remotely or take other measures to reduce the virus’ potential spread.  “The result is inconsistency,” one State Department employee said.  Pompeo has addressed the virus in at least one way: his occasional newsletter to employees. In a recent “Message from Mike,” he offered vague praise at the top for how the “team” has come together to face the crisis. But the message contained no specifics about the virus’s impact on the department itself.",Pompeo faces internal questions about his handling of the coronavirus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/mike-pompeo-coronavirus-134006,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering offsetting the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic by ""immediately"" cutting checks to Americans. Mnuchin, speaking at a White House press conference, did not say how much money Americans could potentially expect to receive, and indicated that the administration could seek to exclude those who are well-off from receiving payments. “We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin told reporters. “Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now — and I mean now in the next two weeks.” Mnuchin indicated that the president’s preference for a payroll tax holiday — a six- to eight-month process — would take too long to put money into Americans’ pockets. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now. So this is now,” Mnuchin said. “This is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy, and we are going to use all the tools we have.” Governors across the country have closed restaurants, bars and other venues across their states as public health officials continue to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The White House released new guidelines Monday encouraging people not gather in groups larger than 10, work and take classes from home as much possible and avoid dining in bars, restaurants and food courts. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 5,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing is made available. More than 90 people have died. Mnuchin, who left the White House briefing early for meetings on Capitol Hill, said he would preview the plan at a lunch with Senate Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed sending every American $1,000 and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has signaled support for a similar proposal to provide immediate economic relief to American families. “I think it’s clear we don’t need to send people who make $1 million a year checks,” Mnuchin said. “That’s one of the ideas that we like. We’re going to preview that today, and then we’ll be talking about details afterwards.”  President Donald Trump added that checks for everyone “may not be an accurate way of doing it because obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks for $1,000.” “We’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day what we’re gonna be doing,” he said. Mnuchin also announced that Treasury would defer an additional $100 billion in Internal Revenue Service payments, bringing the total to $300 billion. Individuals can defer up to $1 million, Mnuchin said, while corporations can defer up to $10 million. The deferments are interest- and penalty-free for 90 days. Still, Mnuchin encouraged as many Americans as possible to file their taxes by the April 15 deadline to ensure those who are eligible receive their refunds in a timely manner. “We don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. “We want you to make sure you get them. Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.”",Mnuchin: 'We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately',2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-government-payments-checks-133994,politico
"The government’s economic stimulus is set to quickly balloon into trillion-dollar territory in the coming days, the largest rescue in modern American history, as major industries flood the Trump administration and Capitol Hill for aid while huge swaths of the economy stall from the coronavirus crisis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans behind closed doors on Tuesday to present lawmakers with options for aid to airlines, hotels, casinos and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The White House was pushing for a package of more than $800 billion, POLITICO reported Monday, and on Tuesday the Treasury Department was preparing to unveil a package of $850 billion including more than $50 billion for the airline industry, $250 billion for small-business support and $500 billion for a payroll tax holiday. A senior administration official acknowledged the proposal could climb above that Tuesday by the time it’s unveiled.  The Trump administration is pushing to send direct payments to Americans in the next two weeks as huge parts of the economy shut down. “Americans need cash now,” Mnuchin said. “And the president wants to get cash now. And I mean now in the next two weeks.“ He planned to discuss the move with lawmakers and announce details later Tuesday.  Democrats are pushing their own package of provisions that don’t overlap entirely with the GOP pitch. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats are pitching a package of “at least” $750 billion that is expected to include more emergency aid for hospitals, expanded unemployment insurance, more funds for small business, help with child care, and food assistance for seniors. The size and scope of the package are morphing rapidly as the economic and market damage mounts. Senate Republicans and the White House are exploring how to fast-track existing legislation with the upcoming stimulus packages. The Trump administration’s goal is to provide individuals and companies with enough cash through emergency payments, loans, tax deferrals or temporary tax cuts to help them survive the sudden downturn.  The presentation is also expected to include an idea President Donald Trump has latched onto — a temporary cut or suspension of the payroll tax cut through the end of the year which would benefit both companies and workers. One version of the payroll tax holiday would cost $950 billion alone through the end of the year. CEOs, union leaders and lobbyists have been warning the administration of mass layoffs if the government does not help soon. Senators seem poised to act this week, while the House is still in recess. Cobbling together a stimulus package worth more than $1 trillion would mark a major ideological shift for Republicans, who spent years decrying debt and government bailouts following the 2008 global financial crisis. But with uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and the volatility in the stock market, the White House does not seem concerned about the price tag — only stopping the financial freefall. Other ideas that have circulated throughout the administration in recent days include inserting into the economic stimulus package a large-scale public works project; tweaks to the EB-5 visa program to boost foreign investment; tariff relief; and even a one-time cash payment to Americans between $500 to $750, according to people close to the administration.  The Federal Reserve and Treasury are already launching programs to provide support through emergency powers. The central bank on Tuesday announced a new lending program, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, under its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Treasury Department will provide taxpayer backing for the effort with $10 billion in capital from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.  “The economic disruption and uncertainty created by COVID-19 has created challenges for the commercial paper market, constraining access to short-term credit for American businesses,” Mnuchin said. “By providing short-term credit, the CPFF will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period.”  Some senior White House officials are also pushing Treasury to issue long-term bonds that would mature in 50 or 100 years to help cover the cost of the stimulus package. Mnuchin has said repeatedly in the past that he is considering issuing such bonds to take advantage of interest rates that the Fed has now pushed to near zero. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has long advocated for the issuance of such bonds, an idea also supported by outside economic advisers to the White House.  Republican Sen. Mitt Romney in recent days has called for giving every American over the age of 18 a check for $1,000 as a form of economic stimulus — a move the administration was moving toward by Tuesday.  The coronavirus relief packages under consideration now by Congress are set to eclipse prior efforts.  The economic stimulus program cleared through Congress in early 2009 under the Obama administration was nearly $800 billion, including a tax cut, infrastructure and numerous other provisions. The bank bailout plan passed by Congress in 2008 under the Bush administration — formally the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP — authorized $700 billion originally intended to buy toxic assets from banks, mainly mortgage-backed securities that plunged in value during the housing crisis. The money was later diverted to multiple different programs to inject capital into banks. The TARP program ultimately disbursed around $426 billion and eventually recovered $441 billion, earning the Treasury Department a nominal profit of around $15 billion. That figure remains controversial. Taking into account inflation from the time of the bailouts, the government actually lost around $25 billion on the program.  It also generated widespread anger that banks and bankers got bailed out while ordinary citizens received far less. The Trump administration is well aware of this history and taking pains to avoid the same optics; top economic officials like Mnuchin and other senior aides around Trump keep emphasizing the need to help small and medium-sized businesses as well. “Everyone will need assistance and that is the bottom line. This is the demand issue because consumers have stopped spending,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a conservative-leaning group founded by entrepreneurs like The Home Depot founder, Bernie Marcus. “Every industry will need some level of assistance. In the past, Main Street America has not been as represented in some economic stimulus packages.”  Ortiz said he has been in touch directly with Mnuchin, who seems very amenable to including relief for small-to-medium-sized businesses in any package. The TARP program also drew widespread criticism for creating a moral hazard – banks could feel emboldened to take risks knowing the government would rescue them -- while creating fewer and even larger banks that now enjoyed a bigger federal backstop. Part of the reluctance among members of Congress and the administration to direct cash payments to individual industries like airlines and hotels stems from the TARP experience and deep voter resentment to corporations and their highly paid executives getting aid over regular citizens. Senior White House officials know that direct aid to airlines in particular may be necessary to avoid crippling bankruptcies, but they are leery of being seen as handing out bailouts and want to be sure that any such aid is dwarfed by proposals that would direct cash to consumers.  As top economic officials and Senate leadership negotiate this stimulus package, Trump is spending the day on the phone with executives from the restaurant and tourism industries, supply retailers and wholesalers. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with CEOs of major hotels including Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt and MGM Resorts International.

"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion and likely to exceed $1 trillion. Nothing is set in stone, but it’s expected to include at least $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said Tuesday at a press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the Democratic process in our state.” But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus. “It is imperative that the people of the 7th Congressional District have a voice in the House of Representatives,” Hogan said.  “The State board of elections contacted us last Wednesday and said they were concerned about being able to conduct the election,'' Hogan said at his press conference. “They could not possibly do the mail-in for the whole state. They said they were incapable of getting it done in time ... but on a small basis in one congressional district for that one vacancy, we are going to ask the board of elections to conduct that election on time.  “We are going to encourage people to vote absentee as much as possible, and those who aren't doing the normal absentee ballot will be able to do whatever additional steps they decide to take for mail-in ballots,” Hogan continued. Hogan’s decision comes amid a national push from lawmakers, state officials and election law experts to allow anyone in the U.S. to cast their vote by mail in light of the public health crisis. Currently, 34 states and D.C. allow voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, and millions of voters still have to queue up in person on Election Day — an activity that blatantly violates new federal guidance against gathering in groups of 10 or more people, as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pointed out Monday when calling for the postponement of his state's primary. While advocates have unsuccessfully called for the adoption of universal vote-by-mail for decades, they’re hoping the coronavirus pandemic serves as a wakeup call.  “In the 15 years I’ve been pushing this, we’ve never had a public health and safety argument for this. Now, we do,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the lead author of a federal vote-by-mail bill, told POLITICO. “Now, for states to say they don’t have a fallback plan and they’re just going to cancel or delay elections – that's not acceptable when we’re in the middle of the pandemic.” Last week, Wyden introduced a retooled version of his decades-old bill targeted for situations like the coronavirus pandemic. He’s currently in the process of convincing fellow senators to support it, and pushing for it to be included in one of the upcoming relief packages Congress is currently putting together.  Under the legislation, if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency, all states have to offer universal vote-by-mail for one election cycle, and the federal government will provide $500 million to make sure pre-paid, self-sealing envelopes are distributed so that voters aren’t spreading germs or having to pay out of pocket.  Even without a federal mandate, Wyden says, the move towards vote by mail is already accelerating in red and blue states alike.  “States are already moving in this direction because people are saying, ‘What other option is there?’” he said. But even some proponents of mail balloting worry about a potential rapid switch to a predominantly mail-in system across the country. “I do think there might be particular challenges to go from in-person voting to almost exclusively vote-by-mail systems,” Dale Ho, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU, said.  “Look, if a state can do it … it is probably due diligence at this point to explore the possibility. But that is a major, major change in the midst of an election year,” he added, voicing concern that such major change could potentially disenfranchise some, like low-income or Native American voters, who may not have a fixed address on file with the state. Ho said that states should, at a minimum, adopt no-excuse absentee voting and make changes in the law to better accommodate voting by mail. Those changes include pushing back the deadline for when mail ballots must be received, allowing election officials to start processing ballots before Election Day, and providing federal funding to support state and local election administrators. Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer who also supports expanding mail balloting, said there also need to be changes to laws in some states that allow individual poll workers to toss out a mail-in ballot if they think the signature on the envelope doesn’t match the signature on file. Voters’ signatures can change over time, they argue, due to age or a disability.  “It's junk science,” said Elias, who is currently suing Michigan over its signature verification law. “At a minimum, voters need to be notified that someone doesn’t think their signature doesn’t match and given an opportunity to fix it.”  Maryland will likely not be the last state to postpone its primaries. Hogan said “other governors are expected to do” the same “later today, or the days ahead.” A spokesperson for Hogan tweeted that “we expect other Acela states to take similar steps.” The April 28 primary was informally referred to as the Acela Primary, because the states voting that day are connected by the popular Amtrak line. Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are all scheduled to vote on April 28; none of them have modified their primaries as of yet.","Maryland postpones primary, shifts special election to mail voting over coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776,politico
"Amazon is taking steps to speed the delivery of household staples and medical products amid a surge of demand because of the coronavirus pandemic — a move that threatens to devastate businesses that use its platform to sell less-essential goods. The country's largest online retailer notified vendors and third-party sellers today that it would temporarily halt the arrival of nonessential goods at its fulfillment centers until April 5. Products that are already en route to or stored inside its warehouses as of today will still be sold, Amazon said. ""We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. The company said it would place the highest priority on products in six broad categories: baby products; health and household goods; beauty and personal care; groceries; industrial and scientific products; and pet supplies. Amazon announced Monday it would hire an additional 100,000 workers in its U.S. warehouses to help handle increased demand. The news comes as several U.S. states and European countries have closed bars, restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and other businesses where people come into close contact in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. With the business closures and ""social distancing"" recommendations, more people are turning to online retailers like Amazon for basic goods like toilet paper and hand sanitizer.","Amazon expedites grocery, health shipments at expense of other products",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/amazon-expedites-shipments-coronavirus-134271,politico
"Joe Biden’s unequivocal declaration that his running mate will be a woman began the 2020 veepstakes with a brutal cut. There will be no consolation prize for Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg or Julian Castro. There will be no unity ticket pairing Biden with Bernie Sanders. Mansplainers and manspreaders, you can go home. Joe has binders full of women. Perhaps there has never been a more serious veepstakes than this one. Biden won’t say on the record that he would serve only one term as president, but he has given enough hints that many have assumed it. That makes his vice-presidential choice the automatic frontrunner for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, and potentially the first female president of the United States. This is no time for your last-call, falling-off-your-barstool, so-crazy-it-just-might-work vice-presidential musings. Already, some names Biden has casually thrown out are non-starters. Jeanne Shaheen is highly accomplished as a former governor of New Hampshire, but Biden should not team up with a fellow septuagenarian. Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates is a fun name to bat around, but getting fired by Donald Trump is not a qualification to be a COVID-19 diagnosis away from being commander-in-chief. Beyond a plausible president, the 77-year-old Biden needs a running mate who can help him either win the critical Midwestern states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, or energize the more racially diverse generations of young voters, who could help not only in Midwest cities, but also in Southern swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida. Who can fit the bill? My rankings, on a scale from Sarah Palin to LBJ-carrying-Texas-for-JFK: She’s a rising Democratic star who may have gotten a raw deal in the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia. But the plain fact remains that the pinnacle of her government service is as a state House minority leader. That does not cross the “Ready on Day One” threshold.  Donald Trump’s election showed that experience doesn’t matter to many voters. But Biden is running as the candidate of reassurance. The prospect of a manifestly under-qualified vice president serving under a president who is pushing 80 is the opposite of reassuring.  Warren did Biden two big favors in the primary. She incinerated Michael Bloomberg, and she has declined to endorse Bernie Sanders. Perhaps Biden would have won South Carolina and Super Tuesday anyway, but Warren’s assistance certainly didn’t hurt. Should Biden return the favor, and help unite the party’s populist and pragmatist wings with a Warren pick? Probably not. Warren has a lot of strong attributes, but being a deferential team player is not one of them. Besides, if Warren wants a job with real power that could clamp down on bad behavior from Wall Street, she should lobby for Treasury secretary or attorney general. Susan Rice may be the African-American Democrat with the most national security experience in the country, having served for the entirety of Barack Obama’s administration, first as ambassador to the United Nations then as national security adviser. No one could seriously question her qualifications to assume the responsibilities of the presidency if necessary. Yet Rice comes with the baggage of the Benghazi affair. Shortly after the 2012 attack on the U.S Consulate in Libya, which killed two American officials, Rice went on several TV shows and said the incident began as a “spontaneous reaction” to an anti-Islamic video, which was then joined by “extremist” elements. Rice was citing what was in the initial intelligence assessment, but Republicans accused her of covering up the role of terrorist organizations. (Later reporting concluded the attack was premeditated by members of a terrorist group, and there was no spontaneous protest, though some of the attackers were motivated by the video cited by Rice.)  Even if Rice can handle the rehashing of Benghazi, the last thing a presidential candidate wants from his vice presidential choice is an immediate distraction.  After just one year in office, the Democratic governor of Kansas has managed to strike an agreement with the Republican leader of the state Senate for a bill that takes advantage of the federal aid offered in Obamacare, expands Medicaid and covers an estimated 130,000 uninsured Kansans. There’s just one problem: the bill is stalled, short one vote in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle and get a floor vote. Regardless of the final legislative outcome, Kelly would be a long-shot pick. She would almost certainly be unable to turn Kansas blue in a presidential election for the first time since 1964. She is not well known enough in the Rust Belt to help flip northern swing states. And as a technocratic moderate, she would not fire up younger progressives.  People who want to put Michigan back to in the Democratic column have an eye on the state’s new governor. On Monday, Whitmer told MSNBC, “It’s not going to be me.”  Even if it is her, Whitmer may not be in a position to help lock Michigan down. When Biden campaigned with her ahead of the Michigan primary, he brought back her 2018 campaign slogan, “Fix the Damn Roads.” However, her attempt to fund the fixing of those roads, a 45-cent gas tax hike, was rejected by the Republican-led state legislature. She’s now issuing bonds to cover the cost of a less ambitious road repair program. A spotlight on Michigan’s partisan gridlock could complicate Biden’s efforts in the state. And a January poll pegged her job approval at a very soft 43 percent (although she was above water, with only 36 percent disapproving.) The New York Times reported this month that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer privately floated the name of the African-American congresswoman from Orlando. In her favor: national prominence after serving as a House impeachment manager, a law-and-order background from her 3 1/2 years as Orlando police chief, an up-from-bootstraps biography as the daughter of a janitor and a maid, and potential vote-getting ability in the swingiest part of the swing state of Florida. But Demings still looks like a stretch. Her political resume is thin, as she is only in her third year in the House. At 63, she may not be the best choice to rally young voters who are skeptical of Biden. And her tenure as police chief is not unblemished. When she first ran for Congress, National Journal reported that the Orlando police department “has a long record of excessive-force allegations,” and in 2009, she was censured “after her gun was stolen from her unlocked truck.” The New Mexican is the only Latina governor in the country. And Biden should like Lujan Grisham’s forceful enactment of a new “red flag law” for gun control. When she signed the bill, she took aim at sheriffs who indicated they may not enforce the provisions. “If they really intend to do that,” she said, “they should resign as a law enforcement officer and leader in that community.”  The Trump campaign has been targeting New Mexico’s five electoral votes. Hillary Clinton won only 48 percent of the vote in New Mexico in 2016. If Trump is truly threatening to poach the state, would Lujan Grisham help protect it? Like Whitmer, her level of support at home is short of intimidating. A January Morning Consult poll found her job approval at just 44 percent. While Lujan Grisham is the only Latina governor, Nevada’s Cortez Masto is the only Latina senator. She’s currently in the middle of her first term. Those who argue Biden is underperforming with Latino voters point to Cortez Masto as a fresh face who can help. Though whether Biden needs that much extra help with Latinos is up for debate. Sanders ran away with the Latino vote in the Nevada caucuses and the California primary. But Biden won with Latinos in swingier Virginia and North Carolina. Plus, Biden stayed closer to Sanders among Latinos in Texas than in California and Nevada. Furthermore, the low-key Cortez Masto has yet to make much of a national impression. That may not be a deal-breaker, but if Biden is looking for a candidate that brings excitement, he should look elsewhere. Today’s Arizona primary should factor into Biden’s decision-making. The increasingly purple state is where the Latino vote might make the most difference for Democrats in November. If Biden’s performance with Latinos is limp on Tuesday, then he should give Cortez Masto and Lujan Grisham, both Arizona neighbors, close looks. The Thai-American senator from Illinois has a gripping biography. While serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Iraq War, she was in a helicopter that was hit by a grenade. She was grievously wounded and had both of her legs amputated. Two years ago, at 50, she became the first senator to give birth while in office. She could easily become an inspirational figure as a vice presidential nominee. However, her backstory isn’t perfect. During her bid for Senate in 2016, Duckworth settled an embarrassing lawsuit accusing her of workplace retaliation when she led Illinois’ Department of Veterans Affairs, a position she was appointed to by newly pardoned ex-con, ex-Governor Rod Blagojevich. Her legal team maintained it was a “nuisance” lawsuit that was settled for only $26,000. But Biden’s vetters should give the case a thorough scrubbing. The moderate Duckworth could also attract barbs from the left. In the summer of 2018, she put some distance between herself and progressive sensation Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Asked on CNN if Ocasio-Cortez represented the future of the Democratic Party, Duckworth snarked, “I think it's the future of the party in the Bronx.” She further argued, “I think that you can’t win the White House without the Midwest and I don’t think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest.” Duckworth brings with her the hope that she can appeal both to older, moderates in Midwest swing states, as well as to younger votes who are eager for a woman of color in the White House. But if the ideological left can’t forgive her dismissal of Ocasio-Cortez, she’s not the right choice to help unify the party. Baldwin is a two-term senator from Wisconsin who could help win back a state that’s been on a political knife’s edge. She is the first openly gay U.S. senator in history, which could excite culturally liberal younger voters. And she’s an economic populist, which may even impress devout supporters of Warren and Sanders.  Being white, Baldwin wouldn’t give the ticket a multi-cultural image, and that could deflate some younger voters. But perhaps the biggest downside is that her ascendance to the vice presidency would create a Senate vacancy that gets filled by a special election, not by an appointment by the state’s Democratic governor. And in politically polarized Wisconsin, there’s no guarantee a Democrat would win that election. With the next Senate almost certain to be narrowly divided, the loss of even one seat could spell the end of Biden’s presidential agenda. If Biden really feels he needs help with flipping Midwest states, Amy Klobuchar is the safest pick. She successfully raised her national profile by running for president. She held her own on the debate stage. She showed that she had pull in Trump-curious Minnesota, helping throw to the state to Biden. And Minnesota’s Democratic governor can appoint her Senate replacement.  Yet Klobuchar is not without risk. Allegations of staff mistreatment tainted the start of her campaign, though no one ever went on the record. Biden’s vetters should certainly find out if there are more shoes that could drop. And Klobuchar’s role, while district attorney, in imprisoning a black teenager on reportedly flimsy evidence could be used by Trump to try to weaken Biden’s support among black voters. Progressive voices in the Democratic Party are already signaling they will react poorly to a Klobuchar pick. Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos tweeted Monday that Klobuchar “would be Tim Kaine 2.0—doing nothing to unify the party, bringing no new demographics to the ticket. It would be (once again) a disaster.” But complaints on the left are an inevitable, and manageable, annoyance. Winning the Midwest takes precedence. But there’s a twist. Biden should conclude, “I don’t need my vice-presidential nominee to win the Midwest. I can win the Midwest all by myself!” Polls and primary results show that he already has strong appeal to white, right-leaning, working-class and suburban swing voters.  Instead, Biden’s vice-presidential nominee would be most useful politically by shoring up his support among culturally liberal young voters eager to elect a woman of color in 2024. That’s why, of all the qualified women of color on the short list, the obvious choice was, and remains, Kamala Harris.  She doesn’t bring a state, but she wouldn’t cost the Democrats a Senate seat either. Besides, who was the last VP to flip a state? Maybe Walter Mondale in 1976. John Edwards couldn’t deliver North Carolina to John Kerry. Paul Ryan couldn’t deliver Wisconsin to Mitt Romney. Flipping home states may be thing that doesn’t happen anymore.  She doesn’t bring the far left, who deride the former prosecutor as a “cop,” but those folks won’t be satisfied with anyone Biden chooses. And if they don’t live in swing states, Biden can let them go. Harris, who is part of both the black community and the Indian-American community (which Trump has been courting heavily), would excite plenty of younger voters who can’t seem to get excited about electing another old white male. She’s a first-term senator who has not produced much successful legislation, but she is a road-tested orator who, over the course of the primary, was vetted by the media without surfacing any uncomfortable surprises. And she proved during the Democratic debates that she is effective at making direct attacks at her political opponents.  Some argue that Harris did too poor a job in the primary to live up to her reputation as a dazzling campaigner. But she didn’t fail because of her stump skills. Where she struggled—as did all the candidates who weren’t septuagenarian men with pre-existing bases of support—was with carving out a distinct ideological profile. She wrongly calculated, in the initial stages of the campaign, that she needed to lean further left than she was comfortable doing. Towards the end of her bid, she let her inner pragmatist shine. She will have no problem echoing Biden’s themes.  A Biden-Harris ticket could aggressively pursue the Upper Midwest, the Southeast and the Southwest, from to Maine or Montana, from Arizona to South Carolina. A thorough vetting process may discover problems that aren’t publicly known. And Biden will, at the end of the day, need to pick someone he feels will be a governing partner, not just a political asset. But the smart money is on Kamala, and no drama.","Biden’s Top 12 Running Mates, Ranked",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256,politico
"The Federal Reserve is aggressively moving to keep money flowing through financial markets battered by the coronavirus pandemic, making hundreds of billions of dollars available to ensure that cash is available to investors, companies and consumers. Days after the central bank slashed interest rates to zero, the Fed on Tuesday launched an emergency effort to make certain that big creditworthy businesses will continue to be able to access funding, amid concern that the cash would dry up. The Fed said it was reopening a crisis-era investment vehicle that will allow it to purchase IOUs from those companies. ""That is a $1 trillion market, and it is critical to American workers, it’s critical to American business and it’s critical to American savers who have a lot of that money in money market funds,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who had to sign off on the move, said at a White House press briefing. ""We heard loud and clear there were liquidity issues."" That comes on top of efforts to ensure smooth trading in key markets for U.S. government bonds and mortgages, such as by offering massive temporary cash injections and pledging to buy billions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. More actions are likely to follow, but without more drastic steps by Congress and the administration, its efforts might not be enough to avoid a broader breakdown in markets. Mnuchin and President Donald Trump outlined several ideas under discussion at the White House briefing. “The Fed’s liquidity injections appear not to be working,” Zoltan Pozsar, a managing director at Credit Suisse, said in a note Tuesday morning. “All segments of funding markets ... continue to show growing signs of stress. The Fed may have to do more still.” The stock market has whipsawed wildly over the past several weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday reporting its worst point loss in history and its biggest percentage-point drop since 1987. The Dow steadied on Tuesday and went up a bit following the Fed’s latest action and a White House progress report on a rescue package. Still, Bank of America Global Research said investors continue to be stingy about extending credit and there are concerns about the stability of various parts of the financial system. “Markets remain in a fragile state and will likely continue to do so until there is greater certainty around the path of COVID-19 outbreak and the fiscal policy response from governments around the world,” the bank said in a report. The Fed acted Tuesday to unclog the market for short-term business debt, with financial experts worrying that mounting problems there could spread and cripple other types of lending. “By ensuring the smooth functioning of this market, particularly in times of strain, the Federal Reserve is providing credit that will support families, businesses, and jobs across the economy,” the central bank said in a statement Treasury will provide $10 billion of credit protection for the purchases from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. Businesses that want to use the facility must pay a fee to register. Companies rely on the market for so-called commercial paper for quick funding, but mutual funds, a traditional buyer of the debt instruments, have been selling to make sure they have enough cash in case many of their customers are looking to withdraw money. “By providing short-term credit, the [Fed facility] will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period,” Mnuchin said in a statement. But Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said the Fed is ultimately constrained in how much it can do, in part because its emergency lending powers for firms other than banks were reined in after the 2008 financial crisis. Congress and the administration will ultimately have to take expansive action to help calm stressed markets, he added. “The Fed’s efforts, while laudable, are a necessary but not sufficient condition to address the nature of the crisis,” he said. “The bottom line is the reason why the market continues to experience historic levels of volatility is that it requires a fiscal response not exclusively a monetary response.”",Fed wages furious battle to unclog financial markets,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fed-battle-unclog-financial-markets-134282,politico
"In March 1918, with the United States fully mobilized for World War I, soldiers at Camp Funston in Fort Riley, Kansas, began reporting acute flu-like symptoms, including aches, respiratory distress, chills, coughing and high fever. Just a month later, over 1,100 men had come down with the disease; 46 of them (roughly four percent) had died. It was the start of the infamous “Spanish Flu”—a misnomer for the scourge that likely began in the U.S. but, as troops fanned out across Europe, claimed 21 million lives globally, including over 600,000 Americans.  What began in Army camps, where 25 percent of soldiers developed the flu, spread by fall to the civilian population. In Boston, 202 people died on just one day—October 1. Philadelphia later topped that record, with 700 deaths in one 24-hour period. The disease wasn’t discriminatory. It devastated urban populations like Pittsburgh and New York City but also hit vulnerable rural areas like Arkansas, where the public health infrastructure was essentially nonexistent.  Lasting just over a year, the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic stands as a lasting reminder of what happens when governments and their citizens fail to meet a crisis head on. From our perch today, as we brace for the coronavirus’ inevitable spread, the missteps of 1918 seem eerily prescient: A lack of leadership from Washington, with the gaps filled unevenly at the state and local levels. Public officials who either lied, dissembled or made up facts. Hucksters who used popular media to misinform the public and make a quick buck in the process. Public health infrastructure that was inadequate to the challenge. And ordinary citizens who often refused to heed the warning of experts. To be sure, science a century ago was light years from present day. The influenza outbreak was far more lethal in our great grandparents’ time than in our own because treatments were nowhere near as advanced. But even back in 1918, developments in medicine and public health had rendered diseases like cholera, typhoid and diphtheria—in recent memory, sure killers—manageable or even preventable. America’s cities and its military had extensive experience with quarantines and other social measures to stop vectors of transmission. And still, government bungling and a general lack of preparedness helped the pandemic spread like wildfire. Professional historians usually recoil from the old adage that “history is bound to repeat itself” (it really isn’t). And yet, sometimes it does. The lesson is pretty simple. Look at what went wrong in 1918. Then do the opposite. Lots went wrong in 1918. Start with the worst example, Philadelphia, where the local government failed abjectly to meet the public health crisis. The problem silently took root on September 7 when 300 sailors, some of whom were already infected, docked in the Navy Yard. Boston had already been hard hit by the epidemic, so city officials were well aware of its deadly potential. The city, whose infrastructure had buckled even before the war, was now teeming with new workers and migrants who stretched the housing stock, streets and transportation to capacity. It took but 10 days before over 600 servicemen and civilians were sick enough to require hospitalization, including several doctors and nurses who had been treating sick patients. Philadelphia’s director of Public Health and Charities, a political appointment that was, like most other positions, a sinecure of the city’s political machine, was Dr. Wilmer Krusen, a gynecologist who lacked training in epidemiology. From the start, he downplayed the severity of the threat, assuring the public that his office could “confine this disease to its present limits, and in this we are sure to be successful. No fatalities have been recorded. No concern whatever is felt.” When fatalities began to mount, he insisted there was nothing to worry about—it wasn’t the “Spanish flu,” but rather, just a few cases of the “old-fashioned influenza or grippe. … From now the disease will decrease.” True to his word, Krusden took no steps to assemble supplies or to identify doctors and nurses who could be made available in the event of mass hospitalizations. He resisted calls by other medical professionals that the city quarantine the Navy Yard.  And then, on September 18, the city held a monster parade to support the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive.  These were the high water mark days of America’s involvement in World War I. The federal government compelled, shamed and goaded citizens into conforming: From the Sedition Act, which forbade interference in the sale of war bonds, to the legions of Four Minute Men who delivered patriotic speeches in movie theaters as the reels were being changed—to say nothing of horrific acts of popular violence against German Americans—public spirit demanded that the parade go on. Tens of thousands of Philadelphians lined the streets to cheer the procession, providing the disease a tragic opportunity to spread. Within 10 days, over 1,000 Philadelphians lay dead, with another 200,000 estimated ill, and the state government in Harrisburg ordered the city’s public amusements and gathering places closed down, a ban that shuttered saloons, theaters, ice cream parlors and movie theaters. It was too little, too late: As the body count continued to climb, the Catholic archbishop assigned three thousand nuns and seminarians to staff makeshift hospitals and dig mass graves. By March 1919, when the threat of influenza lifted, Philadelphia had lost over 15,000 of its citizens. In Pittsburgh, local officials ignored the price of inaction to the east. They failed to line up hospital space and medical professionals, despite “harrowing stories that had come from other sections of the country of multitudes of dead,” the local Red Cross chapter later observed. When the governor ordered all cities to close most places of public accommodation, the mayor objected that “the whole thing seemed wrong,” echoing the city’s public health chief, who waved off calls to prepare for an onslaught of patients with the bloodless observation that “the disease was not affecting Pittsburgh to any great extent.” Of course, it soon did. Mortality rates (though not hard numbers) ultimately exceeded those of Philadelphia, though the city’s delayed and begrudging compliance with the state ban, as well as aggressive action by the Red Cross and other voluntary organizations, may have slowed the pace of infection in a way that spared funeral homes the same appalling over-capacity that hit other places. The failure of Philadelphia’s government to respond quickly and forcefully should have alerted other elected officials to the crisis. In some cases, it did, as in San Diego, where city officials took heed of the carnage that had overrun eastern cities like Philadelphia, Boston and New York and acted quickly to close churches, dance halls, gymnasiums, libraries, swimming pools and all public meetings—except, of course, outside war bond drives. Police enforced these measures aggressively. When the number of infected citizens did not immediately drop, municipal officials worked with the Red Cross to produce and distribute thousands of gauze masks, which many citizens balked at wearing, despite the entreaties of public health officials. The San Diego Union dismissed the very idea out of hand, observing that “modern civilization has abolished the mask as part of the human wearing apparel … only highwaymen, burglars, and hold-up men wear masks professionally.” Still, the city’s early and active efforts contributed to smaller mortality numbers than other municipalities. But the broader pattern that emerged was dismissal, dissemblance and outright deception on the part of public officials who either did not perceive the severity of the threat or who would not acknowledge it, for fear of political consequence. What mayor or governor, after all, wanted to go to war with local businesses, which in every city vocally opposed forced shutdowns? What health official wanted to run afoul of the coercive spirit encouraging war bond drives and other acts of solidarity with the men in uniform? In Denver and Cheyenne, officials caved to business pressure and lifted restrictions, only to reimpose them after the rates of infection and fatality climbed again. Even as his city reeled with the onset of disease, New York City’s public health director waved away calls for greater vigilance, finding that “other bronchial diseases and not the so-called Spanish influenza ... [caused] the illness of the majority of persons who were reported ill with influenza.” Though the federal Public Health Service encouraged cities and states to adopt best practices, in the earliest days when quarantines and shutdowns might have flatten the curve (to borrow from contemporary parlance), the U.S. Surgeon General, Rupert Blue, assured Americans that “there is no cause for alarm if precautions are observed”—a nonchalant remark that newspapers widely reported, and which imparted a false sense of calm. Even when the body count manifestly demonstrated otherwise, Colonel Philipp Doane, who led health and safety at the military shipyards where the disease first spread, dismissed the “so-called Spanish influenza” as “nothing more or less than the old-fashioned grippe.”  Woodrow Wilson, who mobilized a formidable public relations effort to generate populate support for the war, said nothing. This was a time before presidents routinely stepped in to counsel, console or calm the nation through a pandemic. It wasn’t only that many elected and appointed officials failed to meet the moment. In many ways, Americans were ill-prepared to confront a pandemic. The state of the country’s health care system was primitive by modern standards. In Pittsburgh, a city teeming with factories and industrial workers, the poor quality of air contributed to widespread, devastating respiratory problems. Even before the influenza set in, rates of pneumonia reached heights of 253 deaths per 100,000—appalling figures that outstripped every city except New York. In 1923 the Mellon Foundation found that unregulated soot and ash from factories was destroying the health of workers and their families, a condition that many other communities also faced. As well, Pittsburgh had no health infrastructure of which to speak: just 20 community hospitals, some staffed by only one nurse, with an acute shortage of beds. The housing stock was also poor, with most working-class residents crammed into tenements that, under the right circumstances, were petri dishes for disease. They were better off than the 50,000 residents who lived in rooming houses, where they not only shared rooms with perfect strangers but also beds, which they occupied in shifts. Rural America was hardly better equipped to weather the storm than big cities. In the 1920s and early 1930s, researchers would discover the scourge of Southern poverty that left large swaths of the population poorly nourished and afflicted with common parasites and disease. No less than their urban counterparts, the residents of small towns and country communities were physically compromised even before the influenza took hold. In the absence of calm and steady leadership from the top, there was no shortage of hucksters standing by, ready to profit from fear. One Dr. Franklin Duane gave interviews and ran advertisements for a fake home remedy (“Dr. Pierce’s Pleasant Pellets”), arguing that “the more you fear the disease, the surer you are to get it.” Dr. Bell’s Pine Tar Honey, Schenck’s Mandrake Pills, Beecham’s Pills and Miller’s Antiseptic Snake Oil also promised protection or relief from the flu. “When [Vick’s] VapoRub is applied over the throat and chest,” one wide-circulation ad informed readers, “the medicated vapors loosen the phlegm, open the air passages and stimulate the mucus membrane to throw off the germs.” Ordinary people could be forgiven a certain level of gullibility, notwithstanding very real advances in medicine and science that rendered such snake oil ads suspect. But in many localities, they resisted closures and quarantines with as much gusto as the owners of stores, saloons, theaters and restaurants. Neither did they segregate themselves at first indication of infection. In Seattle, according to a local newspaper, “every worker who sniffles is shot with [a] serum … they blow their noses and return to work,” despite entreaties from city health officials that they stay home. After the mayor unwisely suggested that if people observed the quarantine and closure rules, “the epidemic would be ended in five days,” residents began flouting the restrictions entirely. After all, if the mayor wasn’t concerned, why should they be? On one afternoon, when a “trophy train” packed with memorabilia parked itself downtown, thousands of Seattle citizens congregated for nine hours to inspect its wares. We don’t yet know how severe a toll COVID-19 will take on the United States. But we do know a lot. As in 1918, the White House and federal administration have been hopelessly ineffectual —even worse, irrelevant to the national response. Donald Trump’s stature as president appears to shrink with every passing hour. He wasn’t even able to deliver a factually correct speech to the nation while reading off a teleprompter.  As in 1918, state and local officials have responded in widely varying ways. Some, like Republican Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio and Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, have stepped up forcefully to compensate for the glaring incompetency of the Trump administration. Others, like Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who dithered in closing bars, restaurants and schools and even yesterday visited his own gym in defiance of every sound expert reccomendation—or Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and California Congressman Devin Nunes, Republicans who encouraged people to ignore the closures and self-quarantines—have likely endangered thousands of fellow Americans. As in 1918, cities have been slow to impose the types of sacrifices and hardships on local businesses and ordinary people that might have slowed the spread of the disease and thereby flattened the curve. And too many ordinary people have flouted the advice of medical experts until faced with blunt police force. As in 1918, the gaps in America’s health care infrastructure are potentially deadly. Every red state governor or legislator who refused the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid reimbursement has burdened its citizens with rural and small-town hospital closures. Their communities are unprepared for this disease. Many of their citizens suffer respiratory or immunodeficiency diseases that went untreated and have rendered them more susceptible to COVID-19. The absence of universal health coverage has contributed to poorer health, generally, and will likely encourage people everywhere, in red and blue states alike, to ration health care in precisely the moment when they should not.  There was a lot we could have learned from the example of 1918, but didn’t. There’s still more we can learn. It’s a critical week in America, and now more than ever, a little history might be just what the doctor ordered.","Rampant Lies, Fake Cures and Not Enough Beds: What the Spanish Flu Debacle Can Teach Us About Coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/spanish-flu-lessons-coronavirus-133888,politico
"The Chinese government announced Tuesday it would yank the press credentials for reporters of major U.S. news outlets, further escalating tensions between the two countries in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic which originated there.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that journalists from The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal whose reporting credentials expire this year will have four days to notify Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 10 days to turn in their press passes.  “They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions,” the announcement says.  The move comes weeks after the White House moved to limit the number of Chinese citizens who could work in the U.S. for several Chinese state-controlled outlets and ordered them to register as foreign missions. The foreign ministry admitted in Tuesday's statement that the moves are retaliatory, calling the Trump administration's restrictions “expulsion in all but name.” In addition to the three U.S. outlets facing expulsion, Chinese authorities announced that two more U.S. news organizations — Voice of America and Time Magazine — will be designated as “foreign missions” and required to turn over information regarding their “staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.”  Tensions between the global superpowers, already at a peak due to ongoing trade disputes, have spiked in recent months in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The disease, which originated in Wuhan, China at the end of last year, has now spread across the globe and in the past several weeks has forced U.S. leaders to take drastic measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.",China to expel journalists from 3 U.S. outlets ,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/china-to-expel-journalists-from-3-us-outlets-134170,politico
"President Donald Trump denied Tuesday that he has adopted a more dire tone in confronting the coronavirus crisis, insisting that he always took the public health emergency seriously despite several past dismissive remarks regarding the threat it posed to Americans. Speaking at the White House coronavirus task force’s daily press briefing, the president was questioned by reporters about his mood at Monday’s news conference, when he struck a graver note relative to his previous appearances discussing the burgeoning outbreak. “I didn’t think — I mean, I have seen that, where people actually liked it,” Trump said Tuesday of the response to his more sober-seeming public-facing demeanor.  “But I didn’t feel different,” he continued. “I’ve always known this is a real — this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” The president has been criticized over the course of several weeks for repeatedly minimizing the coronavirus threat, while public health officials within his administration have issued urgent warnings as to the risk the disease posed to the nation. In his first statements on the coronavirus in late January, Trump said the United States had it “totally under control” and tweeted days later that it “will all work out well.”  The president’s efforts to downplay the pandemic continued steadily until as recently as earlier this month. He accused the World Health Organization of producing an inaccurate mortality rate, falsely claimed that “anybody that wants a test can get a test,” and predicted that “it will go away. Just stay calm.” But the White House’s optimism seemed to dim significantly Monday, as the coronavirus continued to ravage communities and the federal government rolled out a new slate of stern guidelines intended to counter its rapid spread. Announcing the new measures, a subdued Trump lamented the “invisible enemy” facing Americans and acknowledged that “this is a very bad one.” The apparent shift in messaging coincided with the release of a report by British researchers estimating that as many as 2.2 million people in the U.S. could perish as a result of the coronavirus if drastic steps were not taken to fight its transmission. Addressing reporters Tuesday, however, the president argued that “there was no difference yesterday from days before” in his assessment of the coronavirus, and asserted that he had “always viewed it as very serious.” “I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t,” he concluded.","Trump, who downplayed pandemic threat, says he ‘always viewed it as very serious’",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-shifting-coronavirus-tone-134100,politico
"Last-minute negotiations between Democratic leaders and the White House have downsized the scope of a paid leave program for workers affected by the coronavirus outbreak, angering some Democrats who see it as a major concession to the White House.  The House on Monday night approved a slate of last-minute “technical” corrections to a sweeping aid package, paving the way for swift adoption by the Senate. But several Democrats and progressive advocates say changes pushed by the White House are actually significant revisions to the bill’s paid leave program, undermining one of their top priorities in the package.  “I think the changes the Republicans insisted on made this far worse,” Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who has pushed for far more expansive paid sick and medical leave provisions in the package, said in an interview Tuesday.  “The intent of the package was to provide workers the support they needed to stay home and prevent the spread of this disease,” Murphy said, adding that Democrats would push to restore the provisions in future bills. “We have a chance to take another swing at it. My hope is that we can get Republicans to understand the public health rationale.”  The latest version of the bill, which the Senate is expected to pass this week, includes a major change to federal paid sick leave and family medical leave policy for affected workers, a program long championed by Democrats.  The legislation initially allowed workers up to 10 weeks of paid leave — as part of the federal family and medical leave program — for three different scenarios: if they become sick or are forced to be quarantined, if they are caring for a sick person, or if they are caring for a child whose school or daycare has been closed. Under the latest changes, however, there is only one category that qualifies for the extended family and medical leave: Individuals who are taking care of children.  Pelosi appeared to address the criticism from some in her caucus in a statement on Tuesday, in which she vowed to push for expanded paid leave in the next package. “As the House develops our third Families First package, we are working to advance additional steps to expand the emergency leave mandate,” Pelosi wrote, laying out several provisions, including allowing workers who are sick to access longer term leave.  Democratic negotiators have also stressed that the core tenet of the program — paid sick leave for 14 days — remains intact, potentially helping as many as 87 million people during the public health crisis.   Pelosi was also able to secure other victories in the bill, such as ensuring that individuals who take paid medical leave remain entitled to health care coverage from their employer, which the White House had proposed rolling back. Democrats also upped the size of a tax credit for businesses who continue to offer health coverage to their employees, helping to defray the costs.  Still, several Democrats have been privately livid at the changes to the paid leave program, which was approved when members were back in their districts. And Democratic lawmakers and aides say the concession may be all for naught now that Senate negotiators are talking about combining the House-passed bill with a third major stimulus package and passing it all as one measure this week.   Democrats have complained that they already made major concessions in talks with Mnuchin as they tried to clear the package with House Republicans. The paid sick leave plan envisioned by Democrats had initially been far more dramatic — an entirely new program run by the Social Security Administration. But Republicans had revolted, and eventually both sides agreed to instead bolster tax credits to help businesses expand existing programs.  Now, Democrats say, Mnuchin has again moved the goal posts in an attempt to sell the package to Senate Republicans, some of whom remain skeptical about the costs on small businesses.  “It drives me crazy that it's been sold as a technical change. It's not. It's a major change,” one Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations said. “We had already moved a couple miles from what we introduced. Now we're talking about different worlds. This is extremely narrow now. “  The most recent version of the bill has also sparked confusion over a provision allowing small businesses to obtain exemptions from providing paid leave. The Labor Department can issue regulations exempting certain companies with fewer than 50 employees from requirements that they offer paid family leave and paid sick leave — an apparent difference from the original legislation allowing exemptions from paid family leave only, advocates said.   ""We think that paid sick time and family leave are pretty essential ingredients in how we’re going to be able to manage this,"" said Amanda Ballantyne, the national director of small business advocacy group Main Street Alliance. ""Exempting employers of 50 and fewer exempts a massive part of our workforce.""  In another significant change, the corrected version of the bill eliminates a provision that would have prevented states from receiving greater federal Medicaid funding if those states checked beneficiaries' eligibility more than once a year.  Several states conduct such checks multiple times per year, meaning the initial version could have deprived them of crucial funding ahead of an expected surge of coronavirus patients.   Senate Democrats led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand are expected on Tuesday afternoon to unveil new legislation designed to expand paid leave to all American workers.",Democrats say Mnuchin squeezed paid sick leave program,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/sick-leave-coronavirus-package-congress-134101,politico
"The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration could scare their communities from seeking out care for coronavirus, potentially hastening the spread of a deadly outbreak that’s growing rapidly in the United States, advocates and public health groups are warning. Those serving immigrant populations have reported significant drop-offs in immigrants seeking health care during Donald Trump’s presidency over fears of his administration’s tough enforcement measures. Immigration advocates and health care providers in some parts of the country say there are signs the novel coronavirus is already spreading in immigrant communities, intensifying efforts to fortify the populations against the highly contagious disease. Marco Trujillo, who handles immigrant outreach for a health care coalition in Cincinnati, says he’s fielded questions on coronavirus from dozens of people in the past few days. At least two of those people told him they had symptoms consistent with the virus but refused his pleas to contact a doctor. “They didn’t want to go to the hospital because they are afraid, because of their immigration status,"" said Trujillo, a member of Cincinnati’s Central Community Health Board. “They don't even want to give their information to a doctor.” Democrats have steadily warned that Trump’s immigration policies could undermine efforts to detect and stamp out the virus that’s effectively shuttered large sections of American life. Joe Biden in Sunday night’s Democratic debate, decrying Trump’s policies, said even “xenophobic folks” should want undocumented immigrants to seek out care for coronavirus without fear of deportation. “It’s even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly,” Biden said. Mary’s Center, a Washington-area health care nonprofit predominately serving Latino immigrants, said it’s starting to see potential cases of coronavirus among its patients, though it’s still awaiting results on the limited number of tests they’ve run. Executive Director Maria Gomez said she’s less concerned the center’s patients will be afraid to access care — the center is known and trusted in the immigrant community — and worried more about economic upheaval that’s already affecting their hourly wage jobs. She worries pressures to stay employed and avoid scrutiny of immigration officials will push immigrants to keep working even if they’re infected, increasing the chance of spreading coronavirus to others. “How will they pay the rent?” Gomez said. “They’re afraid to go get any help now because they were just working very hard to make ends meet.” Some lawmakers have called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to suspend immigration raids and arrests around hospitals and medical clinics amid the outbreak. The immigration enforcement agency, responding to concerns around coronavirus, said it ""does not conduct operations at medical facilities, except under extraordinary circumstances."" Public health experts say fears of seeking out care are very real among immigrants — and the clinicians who serve them. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist who studied a 2018 outbreak of mumps in an immigrant community in Pennsylvania, found the outbreak was exacerbated by dozens of people who were undocumented immigrants and legal immigrants without insurance avoiding medical care. Doctors in the area also hesitated to order lab tests or report potential cases out of concern their patients could be reported to immigration authorities. “The doctors had no intention of collecting immigration status, but they were nonetheless conflated with other government officials who did,” said Nuzzo, an associate professor at John Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. “That made it difficult for public health workers to learn how many cases there were and who had the disease.” Democratic officials meanwhile have also pushed the Trump administration to halt a new measure that could make it harder for legal immigrants to get a green card if they’ve used — or are deemed likely to use — safety net programs like Medicaid or food stamps. The revised so-called public charge rule, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect last month, had a chilling effect on legal immigrants seeking out care before it even took effect, advocates say. CDC Director Robert Redfield in Capitol Hill testimony last week acknowledged concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers that the public charge rule could discourage immigrants to get care. But other Trump administration officials have tried to tamp down those concerns. The Department of Homeland Security's immigration agency over the weekend updated its public charge webpage with an alert that ""encourages"" all immigrants with Covid-19 symptoms to seek medical care and said it won't count against their legal status. Still, the guidance — which was promised to lawmakers by Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner who heads the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services — notes that immigration officials must continue to look act use of certain public benefits, including ""those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19"" when they're making a decision about a person's legal status. An agency spokesperson also said the policy isn't meant to discourage immigrants from seeking necessary care — although immigration advocates and health clinics have long said that’s a clear effect of the rule. The Trump administration had estimated 77,000 people were likely to forego Medicaid because of the public charge rule, but health experts predicted millions of people may drop public benefits out of fear they fall under stricter guidelines. Nearly half of the nation’s community health centers reported immigrants were refusing to enroll in Medicaid and some even dropped coverage amid confusion about the public charge rule, according to a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation last fall. Some immigration advocates say there’s been little outreach from official channels on coronavirus geared toward immigrant communities. Those advocates, along with some states and local public health departments, have been trying to fill the gap. In the Texas county that includes the progressive-minded Austin, county officials have set up a coronavirus hotline at clinics that provide care to the uninsured and undocumented. “We are making sure everyone has access to quality care regardless of their citizenship status,” said Ted Burton, vice president of communications at Central Health. “As a community everybody has been really focused on response, prevention and education.”",Trump's immigration crackdown could hurt coronavirus containment efforts,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-immigration-coronavirus-134112,politico

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday acknowledged that there are at least “a couple” of State Department employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus, an admission that comes as he faces pressure from inside and outside his workforce to be more forthcoming about the illness’ impact on his 75,000 staffers worldwide. Pompeo addressed the pandemic during a brief but wide-ranging press conference Tuesday afternoon, but offered few specifics and only after repeated questions. The coronavirus crisis is forcing U.S. diplomats to scramble to help Americans affected overseas while also concerning them for their own safety. “We've had a couple of employees, count them on one hand, who have positive tests,“ Pompeo told reporters at the State Department headquarters in Washington. He did not say where the employees were working, but insisted that the department is handling the cases according to health guidelines.  The department has said it is aware of reports that least one U.S. embassy employee, in Jamaica, has contracted the COVID-19 virus, but otherwise it has divulged little else. A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, told POLITICO there are several other confirmed cases at posts overseas, but none yet in Washington. State Department spokespeople have not offered comment. Frustration with State’s handling of the issue is growing both internally and externally.  Lawmakers and staffers are raising questions about why Pompeo has not been more up front about his workforce’s cases of the virus, while also expressing concerns about a lack of uniform guidance from Pompeo on how employees should adjust their work habits.  The department “has not put forth a coordinated, robust response, which I fear puts the health of its own employees at further risk, and further jeopardizes the health and well-being of the American people,” Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Pompeo dated Monday.  Eric Rubin, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the diplomats’ union, also called for transparency. “We would urge that the administration share all information that is available so that our people have a clear sense of what the dangers are and what they need to do to be safe,” he said.  Pompeo said during his Tuesday news conference that the department has taken “many measures” to protect its workforce, referring to “some 15 guidelines“ along with placing limits on travel. But he declined to go into the “intricacies“ of the department’s actions. Some State Department staffers have privately complained that they’ve not heard more from Pompeo directly on the issue. The internal communication and messaging have been delegated largely to other top State Department officials, who have essentially told various bureau leaders and ambassadors to issue their own guidance to their staffers on whether to work remotely or take other measures to reduce the virus’ potential spread.  “The result is inconsistency,” one State Department employee said.  Prior to Tuesday, Pompeo had addressed the virus in at least one way for his employees: his occasional newsletter. In a recent “Message from Mike,” he offered vague praise at the top for how the “team” has come together to face the crisis. But the message contained no specifics about the virus’s impact on the department itself. Pompeo spent much of the press conference Tuesday addressing other aspects of the coronavirus, including bashing how Iran has handled the crisis in its borders. Pompeo has been a champion of President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure policy toward Iran, which involves heavily sanctioning the Islamist regime there. Those economic sanctions, some critics argue, have hampered Iran’s ability to react to the virus ravaging its population. Pompeo, however, disagreed, arguing that the U.S. anti-Iran campaign allows for humanitarian aid and saying it was the regime’s incompetence and corruption that was fueling the coronavirus crisis. “The Iranian regime is an accomplice,” he said. Pompeo also used the term “Wuhan virus” during the news conference, in a jab at China, where officials have been suggesting, with zero evidence, that the coronavirus may have originated from the United States. Wuhan is the city that has been the epicenter of the virus in China.",Pompeo faces internal questions about his handling of the coronavirus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/mike-pompeo-coronavirus-134006,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering offsetting the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic by “immediately” cutting checks to Americans. Mnuchin, speaking at a White House press conference, did not say how much money Americans could potentially expect to receive, and indicated that the administration could seek to exclude those who are well-off from receiving payments. “We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin told reporters. “Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now — and I mean now in the next two weeks.” Mnuchin indicated that the president’s preference for a payroll tax holiday — a six- to eight-month process — would take too long to put money into Americans’ pockets. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now. So this is now,” Mnuchin said. “This is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy, and we are going to use all the tools we have.” Governors across the country have closed restaurants, bars and other venues across their states as public health officials continue to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The White House released new guidelines Monday encouraging people not gather in groups larger than 10, work and take classes from home as much possible and avoid dining in bars, restaurants and food courts. President Donald Trump discussed on a call with restaurant executives Tuesday morning the important role drive-thru and delivery options can play as Americans adjust to their new normal while the nation grapples with the global pandemic. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 5,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing is made available. More than 90 people have died. Mnuchin, who left the White House briefing early for meetings on Capitol Hill, said he would preview the plan at a lunch with Senate Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed sending every American $1,000 and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has signaled support for a similar proposal to provide immediate economic relief to American families. “I think it’s clear we don’t need to send people who make $1 million a year checks,” Mnuchin said. “That’s one of the ideas that we like. We’re going to preview that today, and then we’ll be talking about details afterwards.”  Mnuchin also announced that Treasury would defer an additional $100 billion in Internal Revenue Service payments, bringing the total to $300 billion. Individuals can defer up to $1 million, Mnuchin said, while corporations can defer up to $10 million. The deferments are interest- and penalty-free for 90 days. Still, Mnuchin encouraged as many Americans as possible to file their taxes by the April 15 deadline to ensure those who are eligible receive their refunds in a timely manner. “We don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. “We want you to make sure you get them. Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.” It’s also possible that trading hours could be reduced at the nation’s stock markets given the economic damage of the coronavirus, Mnuchin said, cautioning that the goal was to keep exchanges open to maintain confidence. While stocks edged upward early in the afternoon Tuesday, repeated selloffs in recent weeks have raised the question of whether exchanges will remain open as the damage continues. “Americans need to know they have access to their money,” Mnuchin said. But “we may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that’s something they need to do.” Trump, whose rhetoric and tone has notably shifted in recent days to reflect the the seriousness of the situation, claimed he always knew “this was real — this was a pandemic,” despite repeatedly downplaying the threat of the coronavirus. He also acknowledged that there could be a 100 percent chance the coronavirus plunges the nation into a recession. “It could be,” he said, insisting he doesn’t think in terms of recession or not. “When we are finished with the virus, we will win. When that victory takes place, our economy will go through the roof. It is so pent up, so built up, it is so ready to go in an upward duration. We have to knock out this enemy.” Toby Eckert and Kellie Mejdrich contributed to this report.",Mnuchin: 'We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately',2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-government-payments-checks-133994,politico
"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion. Nothing is set in stone, but it will include around $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.” U.S. airports largely back U.S. airlines' request for cash, and are asking separately for $10 billion in aid — a number based on an expected 40 percent drop in revenues. “We need to be a part of whatever it is Congress and the administration try to get done here in the near term,” Joel Bacon, a lobbyist for the American Association of Airport Executives, told reporters on a call Tuesday afternoon. “We are quickly reaching a crisis point at airports across the country.” AAAE wants the $10 billion to “be made available to airports as quickly as possible and with as few strings attached as possible.” Bacon noted that airports have $100 billion in collective debt, and that $7 billion in debt and interest payments are due by the end of 2020. “I’m not suggesting that airports are going to shut down,” Bacon added. “What we are worried about is the ability to meet ongoing operational concerns and to pay for ongoing projects and existing debt.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"President Donald Trump punched back on Tuesday against criticism from Democratic governors critical of his administration's coronavirus response, wading into his familiar political spats as the White House looks to combat a pandemic. Trump referred to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as the ""failing Michigan governor"" on Monday and lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after his calls for stepped up federal assistance. Minutes later, he heaped praise on his own administration for ""working very well with the Governors and State officials."" While Cuomo, Whitmer and other governors have been among the most vocal critics of the federal coronavirus response, they have been far from alone. The Trump administration has come under a steady drumbeat of scrutiny over its inability to quickly ramp up coronavirus testing capabilities as well as its weekslong rhetorical campaign to downplay the virus' threat to Americans. Only recently has the president reversed course in his own public utterances to warn the public about the severity of the pandemic's threat. Although Trump and Cuomo sparred Tuesday on social media, it appeared the two made amends after a morning phone call. Not long after Cuomo praised the Trump administration for being ""responsive"" at a press conference on Tuesday, Trump told reporters at the White House press briefing that they were both ""doing a really good job."" ""We had a very good talk,"" Trump said. ""I think we are right there on the same track. It's going to be very successful."" But Trump didn't let up on Whitmer during Tuesday's press briefing — defending his attacks on the Michigan governor.  ""I only do that when I have to respond,"" the president said in response to a question about his criticism of Whitmer and other high profile Democrats. ""She said that will something that was false, and therefore I did do that, and I will continue to do that. If they're not going to play fair because, you know, they have the media on their side. I don't. I just have me. And if they are not going to play fair, I'm going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there's going to be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of bipartisanship.""  The president's criticism of Whitmer on Tuesday was triggered by her appearance on MSNBC, where she said her state is working to flatten the curve by closing restaurants and bars after a federal government response that did not take the outbreak “seriously early enough.” She also outlined her plan to expand unemployment benefits as workers lose jobs and are forced to stay home amid the pandemic.  “The federal government did not take this seriously early enough, and now it is on us to make sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science available and that we are always putting the health of our people front and center,” Whitmer said on MSNBC. Trump soon after tweeted that the Michigan governor ""must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!” During a White House news briefing on Monday, the president also suggested that state leaders work to obtain medical equipment like respirators and ventilators on their own because of the slow federal process — a suggestion Whitmer called ""mind-boggling.""  “We need federal support. Like I said, we’re pulling out all the stops and reaching out to our partners in the private sector,” Whitmer said. “We’re going to do everything we can to supplement. But it’s not to the exclusion of federal support. We need the federal government to ramp up and to get this done.”  The president's feud with Cuomo, which bubbled up again Tuesday, has simmered for days amid back-and-forth criticism between the two men over the Trump administration's coronavirus response. The New York governor has repeatedly called for more federal help, to which Trump has replied that it is Cuomo who needs to do more. On Tuesday, the president accused Cuomo of playing politics with his criticism of the administration and suggested that a blanket federal policy of the type that some have called for would not be appropriate. ""Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,"" Trump tweeted, referring to the novel coronavirus by a controversial name that some in his administration have adopted. ""New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it.”  Trump ended his tirade against the governors with the tweet praising the federal government’s work with state and local officials, promising that “Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS.”",Trump lashes out at Dem governors amid coronavirus coordination,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-whitmer-cuomo-coronavirus-response-133716,politico
"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.   The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return.   But since some Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.   Another concern for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans is a practical one — if they let the Senate adjourn following passage of the ""Phase 2"" House bill, it may be logistically difficult to get senators back to Washington once they go home because of travel hurdles. Airline service has been severely disrupted so far, and situation may worsen. In addition, if one or more senators contract the virus, returning to Washington may prove impossible.  But the idea of combing two stimulus packages will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.   The White House Tuesday morning began signaling it was aiming for $850 billion in stimulus spending, split between a payroll tax cut, support for the airline industry and $250 billion in loans for small business.   ""I don’t know how it happens exactly yet. I know that 'Phase Two' will kind of be the baseline approach and then we’ll try and go from there,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) on Tuesday.   ""There’s a third iteration that we’re working on and how it gets across the floor and back to the House remains to be seen. I mean they could move separately, but maybe there’s a way we combine it,” he said.  The House passed the $100 billion-plus ""Phase 2"" stimulus bill on late Friday night, but then had to amend the package Monday with significant ""technical corrections"" following discussions between Mnuchin, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).   The revised legislation — which provides paid sick days and emergency leave to workers who are ill or have family members with coronavirus — is set to be taken up the Senate this week.   Several senior Democratic aides said combining the two packages into one would be a nonstarter in the House without significant concessions.  House Democratic leaders are already dealing with rank-and-file anger over a “technical corrections” bill the House passed late Monday that actually included a significant rewrite to the paid leave language in a major concession to the White House. The change — which would allow more businesses to seek exemptions from offering their employees paid leave — was pushed by administration officials as necessary to get the bill through the Senate, according to multiple sources. But now, if the House-passed bill is combined with a huge economic package, they didn’t even need to make that major change, House Democratic aides argued.  Pelosi appeared to address the criticism from some in her caucus in a statement on Tuesday, in which she vowed to push for expanded paid leave in the next package.  ""As the House develops our third Families First package, we are working to advance additional steps to expand the emergency leave mandate,"" Pelosi wrote, laying out several provisions, including allowing workers who are sick to access longer term leave.  In addition, several Democrats said the payroll tax cut was still a nonstarter, citing tepid support for the idea even among Republicans. And they threw cold water on the idea of just cutting checks to people, saying the bureaucracy needed to implement such a massive program could delay payments for weeks if not longer.  “All this stuff can come together fairly quickly,” said one Democrat involved in the negotiations. “The question is what are ideas that can come together fairly quickly? Something new like direct payments to people isn’t feasible.”  Democratic aides said they were instead looking at other ways to pad people’s wallets by expanding credits already written into the tax code.

"Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, has tested negative for coronavirus, a party spokesman announced on Wednesday, just days after she displayed flu-like symptoms following a trip to Mar-a-Lago. “On the advice of her doctor, @GOPChairwoman was administered a test for COVID-19. That test has fortunately come back negative,” Michael Ahrens, the RNC communications director, posted on Twitter. McDaniel had come down with symptoms on Friday after attending a fundraiser at President Donald Trump’s private club in Florida last week. A number of officials and foreign visitors had exhibited symptoms after visiting the club in the past month. Trump hosted a delegation from Brazil, including President Jair Bolsonaro, at the club last week, a number of whom tested positive for coronavirus and had direct contact with Trump. The White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley, announced last Friday that a person seated at Trump’s dining table had tested positive, but that the risk of infection was low for the president. Trump tested negative for the virus, the White House announced on Saturday morning. Bolsonaro posted on Facebook that he had also tested negative for the virus. Several of Trump’s closest associates and aides have gone into self-quarantine after coming in contact with the Brazilian delegation or otherwise engaging with people at Mar-a-Lago.

"Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, sought to pre-empt questions about Sanders’ future by sending a statement to reporters Wednesday morning implying he has no immediate plans to drop out.  It didn’t work as planned. Instead, after the Vermont senator lost Florida, Illinois and Arizona by double digits, he spent his Wednesday shooting down rumors about his campaign folding, canceling all of his digital ad spending, and lashing out at a reporter who asked about what he often refers to as “political gossip.” Sanders’ campaign had hoped he could pull off an upset in just one state that voted on Tuesday. Having fallen short of that mark, Shakir’s statement attempted to buy some time for the campaign as it assessed its future. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” he said. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.” In an email to supporters, Shakir was even more blunt. “No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,” he said. After likely voting on coronavirus legislation, he said, Sanders would fly from Washington to his home in Burlington, Vt., where he would ""begin holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign."" One ally whom Sanders’ campaign reached out to Tuesday was Scott Slawson, president of the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America Local 506, which has worked closely with the campaign. Slawson spoke at Sanders’ kickoff rally last March, and Sanders talked about his union members at a CNN town hall. He argued Sanders should stay in the race. “There’s still a lot of states that got to weigh in. I think you got to do your due diligence and stay in till the end at this point,” he said. “I know that he’s got a pretty big following in Pennsylvania. There’s a lot of delegates still hanging out there.” Even so, Sanders’ nosedive has led to intense questioning from the media about the future of his campaign, culminating in an inaccurate report on Axios that said he was suspending it. And the wall of pressure from centrist Democrats to abandon his bid for the White House has only intensified after his losses Tuesday. Both factors are likely to aggravate Sanders, who has long brawled with moderates and the news media. “This campaign’s over. He needs to acknowledge that and be gracious about it,” said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way. “Not only for party unity, which is up to him, but just for the sake of humanity, it would be better for him to wrap this up.” As he weighs his options, many of Sanders’ aides and allies are urging him to press forward, even if it is nearly impossible to win the nomination at this point. They see a benefit for him in trying to push Joe Biden to the left and continuing to grow the progressive movement. “The campaign is so useful for building lists, leadership and organizational infrastructure that I think it’d be a big blow for the left if he dropped out any time before the convention,” a Sanders aide said. David Segal, executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress, co-wrote a Wednesday op-ed that argued Sanders should not drop out. He said he was speaking for himself and not the organization. “The alternative is an intentional, monthslong process where Bernie and Biden actually come to a deeper consensus and unity around a set of issues and especially around personnel,” he told POLITICO. “It’s important that you actually have a coming-together that feels more real than the last one in 2016.” Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the progressive political action committee Democracy for America, said that while Sanders’ path to the nomination is “significantly steeper” after Tuesday, “the reality is this is a contest that has changed overnight repeatedly throughout the entire primary, and no one really knows what’s going to happen moving forward.” Sanders, he said, had time to figure out his next steps: “The next contest isn’t for weeks, so I think we’ve got a lot of time.” Sanders’ staffers did not provide a time frame on when he would make his decision. Mike Casca, Sanders’ communications director, said “his head really is in the coronavirus response.” Sanders’ concern with the pandemic sweeping the world was evident on Wednesday, when he snapped at a reporter who asked about timing on his decision. “I’m dealing with a f---ing global crisis,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. ""Right now, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that we don't have an economic meltdown and that people don't die. Is that enough for you to keep me busy for today?"" On Wednesday, Sanders’ campaign canceled all digital ads, including online fundraising spots he launched just on Tuesday. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser, insisted that they pulled the ads because it is unclear when the next primaries will be held as states postpone elections because of the coronavirus. “We make ad spending decisions based on many criteria,” he said. “One of the most important is when the election in a state is happening because advertising is most effective closer to Election Day. Primary dates are all moving back and our ad spending reflects that.” Other presidential candidates who have pulled their advertising and said they were reevaluating their campaigns have often withdrawn within hours. But at least one hasn’t followed that path: Sanders. In April 2016, his senior strategist, Tad Devine, said Sanders was reassessing his campaign after a string of losses to Hillary Clinton made it virtually impossible for him to win the nomination. A day later, his campaign announced that it was laying off hundreds of staff and zeroing in on winning delegate-rich California. This year, Sanders does not have California to look forward to after he won the Golden State on Super Tuesday. But his aides have thought he would have a good chance in New York, which casts ballots on April 28 and already has Sanders staff. As a son of Brooklyn, the state also holds an emotional significance for him. But 2020 and 2016 are different in important ways. Sanders personally likes Biden and badly wants to defeat Trump. Because of the coronavirus epidemic, Sanders also cannot hold the large rallies that project excitement and energy, and that he personally enjoys. While the result on Tuesday further deflated Sanders’ supporters, progressives surveying the map nevertheless found one major sign of progress in their movement. As Sanders was getting shellacked in Illinois, incumbent Rep. Dan Lipinski, a Democrat known for his opposition to abortion rights and Obamacare, was felled by Marie Newman, a progressive who supports Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Unlike Sanders, Newman was able to unite left-wing activists like the Justice Democrats and more traditional liberal groups such as EMILY’s List. She also carried Sanders’ endorsement. “This is now the third incumbent that has been beaten by a Justice Democrats progressive in the last cycle and a half,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant who advised Cynthia Nixon in her primary campaign against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2018. “It’s a big win, and it also shows what happens when the left comes together.”","Bernie’s rough day after

"House Democrats are drafting a new stimulus bill to address the coronavirus pandemic — legislation designed as their counter-offer to a trillion-dollar package currently being assembled in the Republican-controlled Senate.  On a private call Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed her leadership team and committee chairs to begin further efforts to address the looming economic disaster caused by the growing coronavirus crisis.  The House Democratic plan will incorporate proposals from several panels and is expected to include additional unemployment insurance payments, expanded Medicaid coverage, an airline rescue package, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, and additional food security measures, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides.  “Time is of the essence, and the House will move swiftly to protect public health and provide relief for the American people,” Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday.   Each House committee will submit their own plans to Pelosi, who will compile a large-scale relief package in the coming days. Pelosi and her top deputies plan to review the ideas with Democrats — who are working from their districts this week — on a conference call Thursday afternoon.  Democratic sources cautioned, however, that their proposal won’t be formally finished until next week. And it’s still unclear if Pelosi intends to bring the House back to vote or just use the Democratic initiative as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Senate and President Donald Trump.  At times, the call showed the stress facing even lawmakers, as they attempt to hammer out next steps: Pelosi and House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), for instance, had a tense exchange during the call over whether the 2008 Wall Street bailout focused too heavily on big banks and not enough on average Americans, a point both lawmakers made, according to multiple sources who were listening. A source close to Pelosi downplayed the exchange.  Pelosi’s move comes as House Democrats have essentially been locked out of high-stakes negotiations over the so-called “Phase 3” coronavirus relief package. The White House — through Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and top Senate Republicans are rushing to draft a trillion-dollar measure that will help keep airlines and small businesses afloat. Mnuchin and Senate Republicans are also considering a $500 billion plan to send direct cash payments to millions of Americans. The Kentucky Republican is hoping to unveil a GOP position on this new package as early as Thursday, and then enter into discussions with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Senate Democrats have floated their own $750 billion economic package that includes hundreds of billions in spending to help Americans in economic distress.  McConnell has made clear he wants to deal with Schumer alone, not both Democratic leaders.   ""I anticipate what I've said repeatedly, which is we're in a process of deciding exactly where we are and where the administration is — and then we obviously intend to sit down with Sen. Schumer,"" McConnell told CNN. ""And I'm sure he will keep the speaker in the loop and we'll move to getting a bipartisan agreement.""  Speaking to her leadership team, Pelosi argued that the “fastest way to get a third package finished by early next week” is for all four senior congressional leaders to sit down and negotiate together, according to an aide on the call. Schumer also made the same argument on the Senate floor Wednesday.  Pelosi is in a race against time as McConnell and GOP leaders have vowed to move the third tranche of recovery legislation through the Senate at “warp speed.” McConnell needs 60 votes to pass any legislation, and House Democrats are concerned he could pick off some Senate Democrats and move a bill through that chamber that they don’t support — leaving them in a difficult position both politically and policy wise.  Pelosi spoke to both Mnuchin and McConnell separately on Tuesday about the next package. But McConnell has rejected Pelosi’s idea of a “four corners” negotiation that includes the quartet of party leaders in both chambers. Schumer has also called for a “four corners” negotiation.  Democratic sources with knowledge of Pelosi’s move said it’s important that they lay down a marker of what proposals the House will and won’t accept, even if they’re not directly in the room with McConnell.   Even Senate Democrats have complained that they’ve been boxed out of the talks in the early stages of legislation that is likely to exceed a trillion dollars. “Republicans have not consulted any Democrats as to what we want in there,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said during a press conference on Wednesday, when asked about the state of talks on the third package. “Right now, they are doing this from their side only.”  The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a multi-billion-dollar aid bill that moved through the House last week. The bill, known as “Phase 2,” expands safety net programs including paid sick leave, unemployment insurance and food assistance to help Americans impacted by the coronavirus. Congress previously passed legislation to bolster the public health system.  Pelosi has said the House and Senate should consider refundable tax credits, expanded unemployment insurance and direct payments. But the California Democrat has been firm that any of the proposals “MUST be targeted,” her spokesman Drew Hammill wrote on Twitter this week.  Pelosi led the negotiations on the second bill, consulting with Mnuchin dozens of times via phone last week as the two worked to quickly hammer out the legislation. McConnell deferred to Mnuchin on the talks but has taken control of the negotiations of the latest legislation.  Congressional leaders are hoping to act quickly to pass the “Phase 3” package both to try to steady the financial markets, which continue to be in a tailspin as the long-term impacts of the virus remain unknown, and to limit the potential exposure lawmakers have to the coronavirus. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) announced Wednesday he had become the first lawmaker to test positive with the virus.",Pelosi looks to lay down marker on next stimulus plan,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/nancy-pelosi-coronavirus-stimulus-plan-136142,politico
"Probably for most of us, the coronavirus crisis will soon enough—Six months? A year?—recede in our minds and come to seem like a hallucinatory moment. Maybe it will be like a hurricane that forced everyone to rush inland and then only glanced the coast.  Or maybe it will be like a hurricane that really does hit. Even then, human nature being what it is, most people will clean up and move on. Yet no matter how the coronavirus pandemic passes, or how quickly, there is likely in these strange housebound weeks a new political epoch being born. There are two large reasons to believe the political echo of this crisis will last much longer than the crisis itself. The first is that many of the people whose expectations and routines are most dramatically upended by the pandemic are students. The interruption, and in some cases irreplaceable loss, of important experiences in their education, as campuses empty and untold events are canceled, will likely shape their consciousness in more lasting ways than for the rest of us. Like most catastrophes, the pandemic’s malign consequences will fall most heavily on the underprivileged. Unlike most catastrophes, its costs are also being paid heavily by some segments of the most privileged. Those college seniors whose spring terms and graduation ceremonies are suddenly deleted include many people who are future leaders of the public and private sectors. No, it’s not the end of the world for them. But it’s a piercing loss even so—one being paid more for the benefit of older, less healthy people than for pure self-protection. More profoundly, the dynamics of the coronavirus moment likely will resemble the dynamics of other great public policy issues shadowing the next generation. In particular, the global pandemic and the harsh choices it imposes offer—in highly concentrated fashion in coming months—much the same choices that responses to global climate change will impose in coming decades. Like the coronavirus emergency, climate change is a problem whose dimensions are largely the province of scientific experts—employing complex data models aimed at illuminating future trends that the average citizen can understand in broad concept but not in detail. The essential question: Do you trust these experts, or not? Like the coronavirus, climate change is a problem for which remedies are not solely the province of experts but are primarily the realm of community values. These remedies involve tangible and immediate costs for benefits that are abstract and imponderable.  In the case of coronavirus, for instance, the shutdown of the economy required by enforcing social distancing imposes costs that are immediate and quite likely already in your midst—layoffs of someone you know, uncertainty about future income, concern for a favorite neighborhood business about to go under. As to the benefits, meanwhile, no one knows—certainly not now, maybe not ever. Perhaps the massive response won’t really be effective and a public health catastrophe unfolds anyway. Or maybe the response in retrospect will seem overblown. In the case of climate change, the tension between immediate certain consequences—whether paying a carbon tax or substantially altering consumption habits—for diffuse and distant benefits is more acute. The rewards for the deep and comprehensive changes needed to replace a carbon-fueled economy and halt the warming of the planet will be enjoyed—one hopes—primarily by people not yet born. Finally, of course, coronavirus is like climate change in the sense that it is impervious to national borders. One way to gauge the power of these currents—crisis fueled by frightening science—is by watching the change in President Donald Trump. There is no way to know for certain what the coronavirus means for his reelection. But already it is evident what it has meant for Trumpism. It has sent it hurtling into retreat. Trumpism as an idea is about promoting and protecting American sovereignty and singularity. In some contexts, even Trump foes might agree it’s an attractive concept: Well might we wish to seal our borders from the virus. But the only way this would be effective would be if the United States had years ago opted to adjourn from the modern interconnected global economy. Yes, the coronavirus first presented itself in China. How many people were surprised to learn only in the past few weeks that nearly all U.S. antibiotics also come from China. Trumpism as a style is defined not just by boasting and bluster; his triumphalism depends on projecting certitude. The president early on acted as if he could indeed create reality by proclamation, when he assured the public that U.S. infections would soon be down to zero. Only in recent days, as the possibility of widespread domestic disease mounts, has Trump acknowledged imprecision—the fragmentary nature of our understanding of how far the virus has spread, how effective efforts to blunt its impact will be, or when these efforts will be deemed sufficient.  One way to appreciate the murkiness of our circumstances—and the moral implications of this murkiness—is to view them through the eyes of young people. No need to overstate things. Missing spring semester is not the same as dodging sniper fire in Kabul, nor the same as being laid off from your job handling bags at O’Hare.  But nor should one understate things. Suppose baseball has been your consuming passion since age 6 and now at 22 you are expecting one last idyll as team captain. Now that season will never happen. Maybe you were planning to spend the semester in Peru and are now scrambling to see if you can find a flight home. Planes and restaurants will fill up again. In all likelihood that semester abroad is gone for good. Psych 101 perhaps can be taken remotely; the exhilarating 1 a.m. conversation in the dorm lounge will not be.  Out of curiosity, I read various college and university presidents’ letters announcing the closure of their campuses. Most were filled with the same kind of bromides as your workplace or mine offered about caring first and foremost for the health and etc., etc., of our community. One letter, by Williams College president Maud Mandel, stuck out for its candor: “A healthy person could reasonably choose to stay and accept the personal risk of catching COVID-19, but the decision would unacceptably increase the chance of contagion for others.” Indeed, that 21-year-old might plausibly calculate, even if he or she gets sick the chances are, not for everybody but for most, that it would be a miserable few days rather than life-threatening illness. Those institutions closed less to protect their campus communities than to protect the broader society. The coronavirus pandemic does not remotely have the cataclysmic shock and violence of 9/11. For many people, however, the virus’ actual day-in, day-out impact will be more pervasive. 9-11 was followed by a period, which turned out to be short-lived, of national connection and goodwill. Trump, who has made mockery and castigation of opponents his signature, surely did not conjure fuzzy feelings from many quarters with his appeal at the White House on Wednesday that, “We are all in this together.” Yet the pandemic has a logic that transcends politics and personal feeling. Never mind how one feels about Trump. Never mind how we feel about one another. The reality of a dangerous virus is that we are all in this together. ",The Pandemic is the End of Trumpism,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/the-coronavirus-generation-comes-to-life-136491,politico
"Hospitals are struggling to find enough doctors, nurses and other health care workers to care for mounting numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients. The staffing problems are on top of the equipment problems — the lack of ICU beds, ventilators, and masks and other protective equipment needed to prevent the healers from becoming patients. Hospitals are taking extraordinary measures to bulk up the workforce, from calling on retirees for help to assigning medical students to answer the phones. The Trump administration on Wednesday announced new rules that would let doctors practice across state lines, without going through layers of recertification and licensing. And CMS is releasing recommendations on limiting non-essential elective procedures, which will also free up personnel and resources — although hospitals, which rely on some revenue-producing elective procedures, raised alarms over the weekend over how to define “elective care.” “They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines,” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma at a White House press briefing Wednesday. The VA is also preparing to help bolster the civilian health care system. But the numbers of physicians is finite — and older ones, as well as those with their own health conditions, are at risk from Covid-19. The problem is compounded by the infectious nature of the disease, which is exposing dozens of frontline workers who need to self quarantine if they have the virus. Some have already fallen ill. “Dozens of frontline caregivers in the United States have been exposed,” wrote two Harvard University medical students Adam Beckman and Suhas Gondi and Yale University health policy expert Howard Forman on the Health Affairs blog Wednesday. “This trend will accelerate in the coming weeks and months, as health care workers increasingly come into contact with patients with Covid-19 and shortages of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) worsen.” Hospitals will have to figure out how to steer any surging workforce, who should concentrate on coronavirus patients and who should take care of people who still come in with other serious diseases and injuries. And some community physicians, who may not have been in an ICU since their training but want to lend a hand, say they haven’t gotten a lot of guidance. Hospitals are taking a sweeping look at how they can boost their staff — and already retired doctors have offered step up if they can easily renew their licenses and admitting privileges. “It’s all hands on deck — especially well-educated clinical hands,” said Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association’s vice president for quality and patient safety policy. She said some hospitals have reached out to medical and nursing schools asking who can “offer extra hands.” Widespread school closures have also created problems for medical workers — as well as other hospital personnel including food service and the crews who more than ever who have to clean and disinfect — with kids now at home with no one else to take care of them. Some facilities are creating on-site child care facilities and also subsidizing these services, as the AHA and America’s Essential Hospitals call on more dollars from Congress to help. “As they start closing schools down … it creates downward pressure on the availability of staff,” said Alan Levine, CEO of Ballad Health, which has more than 20 hospitals serving rural Tennessee and Virginia. “We lose some of our nurses and health care manpower.” The Association of American Medical Colleges called on med schools to bar students from their clinical work with patients for two weeks — and some students are instead performing telehealth screenings or babysitting the children of doctors and nurses, so they can go to work. Meanwhile, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is asking medical, nursing and public health schools for detailed information on how many students and staff could pitch in, and what their specialties are. At Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, staffing is the primary concern. They have two coronavirus teams of six staff each — and contingency plans for freeing up more staff, while also working with the other hospitals in the city on how to manage an influx of patients. Some doctors say they are ready to help — even if they aren’t pulmonologists or ICU doctors, they can still care for patients, freeing up colleagues to concentrate on the pandemic. But it’s not at all clear that hospitals have figured out how exactly to pull these levers. The American Nurses Association suggested that nurses with inactive licenses, school nurses and senior nursing students can take on roles like helping out at drive-thru testing sites or long-term care facilities. Rural areas haven’t been hit as hard yet as their urban counterparts in places like New York, the Seattle area, and parts of California. But they already are seeing boosts in patients and workforce shortages. Their hospitals are already very lean, and a lot of the physicians are older, meaning they have their own coronavirus risks. And 48 percent of rural hospitals operate on a loss, according to the National Rural Health Association, making any surge in patients particularly difficult. “In a small rural hospital, each employee wears several different hats, and if you lose just one of those, it’s like you’re losing a couple different employees, and soon the facility will be unable to function,” said Maggie Elehwany, the association's government affairs and policy vice president. For instance: In Indiana, one rural health member relayed to the national association that two staff members are quarantined, while the hospital is running low on money. They have four EMS personnel on staff, and are unsure how they would make up for the staffing loss if those front line workers have to self isolate. But worries over the fast-moving coronavirus don’t stop at staffing shortages. “We’re actually rather desperate for help right now,” said Cassie Sauer, president and CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association, where one of the most severe outbreaks is taking place. “We’re asking the navy to send a Navy Ship up here from San Diego — a medical ship — we’re asking for field hospitals, we’re asking for the National Guard, we’re asking for a release of the national strategic stockpile for PPE.” President Donald Trump did deploy two hospital ships on Wednesday though not necessarily to Seattle. Shortages of personal protective equipment, bed capacity and key lifesaving equipment are mounting as more and more confirmed coronavirus cases crop up around the country. Washington State Hospital Association is calling on other industries, such as dentists, veterinarians and even automakers, to share their supplies of personal protective equipment. Levine said Ballad Health ordered more ventilators, but estimates they will take eight to 10 weeks to arrive. “Italy bought them up,” he said. He’s considering reopening one shuttered hospital as a Covid-19 hub — but will have to staff it. The Ohio Hospital Association is talking to local nursing homes about using an empty wing or a building to treat non-coronavirus patients safely, freeing up hospital rooms for Covid-19 patients. They may even turn to floors of hotels for the less seriously ill patients. University of California San Francisco has converted a floor of its largest facility, which has 600 beds, to an environment that can house coronavirus patients. The hospital has about two weeks of personal masks, gowns and gloves on hand, and is treating about 40 per day – and testing about 100 more. Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act, which puts the economy on a wartime footing against the virus. The VA is also preparing to share both medical personnel and equipment to shore up a civilian health care system about to face unprecedented demands. But there’s still uncertainty for how much further the health care system will be pushed — and if it’ll reach a breaking point. “I think there’s a lot we don’t know and I know that there are folks out there modeling scenarios,” Beth Feldpush, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at America’s Essential Hospitals. Debra Kahn, Susannah Luthi and Alice Miranda Ollstein contributed.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act to get medical equipment to hospitals in the fight against the coronavirus. But don't expect new masks, ventilators, gloves and goggles to show up in the field right away. The Trump administration has yet to complete a comprehensive assessment, despite weeks of discussion about using the act to help prevent the medical system from being overrun, according to current and former administration officials. Even Trump said on Wednesday that he's in no hurry to order the supplies. In an executive order issued Wednesday afternoon, Trump granted authority primarily to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to determine “the proper nationwide priorities” and to allocate all necessary health and medical resources and services. Azar will work with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, the order says. “To ensure that our healthcare system is able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is critical that all health and medical resources needed … are properly distributed to the Nation's healthcare system and others that need them most at this time,” the order says. Invoking the DPA means that if the government places an order with a private company for any medical equipment to treat the coronavirus — masks and ventilators are the two prime examples — then that company would be required to fulfill the government’s order before anyone else’s. But while it gives the government priority, invoking the act does not do anything to increase production of these items, which increasingly are in short supply. “It doesn’t help capacity,” said Doug Jacobson, an international export-control lawyer in Washington. “If you only have capacity to produce X number of units, it doesn’t help that. It just simply reprioritizes where the supply chain is oriented to.” A White House spokesperson didn't respond when asked whether the administration is positioned to immediately begin placing orders with private companies, or what those orders would might like. And Trump followed up the order with a tweet in which he indicated that he is in no rush to use the authorities. ""I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!"" Lawmakers and former government officials who have been responsible for disaster preparedness and participated in exercises to game out responses in such national crises expressed alarm at the seemingly blasé approach. ""The government should be placing purchasing orders for this equipment and they should know what they are asking for,"" said Katrina Mulligan, former director for preparedness and response in the National Security Division of the Justice Department and former member of the National Security Council staff. ""And right now, it appears that neither of those things are happening."" “They have not done this assessment,"" said Mulligan, who is managing director of national security and international policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""It is shocking. It is malpractice.” Taking full advantage of the authorities by definition poses significant challenges. ""It’s been used, but not like this,” said Kelly Magsamen, a former Pentagon official and National Security Council staffer in the Bush and Obama administrations. “It’s a pretty big step."" She, too, said it remains unclear how quickly the powers can now be set in motion most effectively and efficiently. ""So far, we haven’t seen the White House actually issue any orders to manufacturers,"" Magsamen said. ""That’s the next step. They have to issue orders so that the private sector and manufacturers can figure out how to fill them. The White House has to do its own homework in terms of assessing its ventilator reserves, which hopefully is underway. ""Somebody in the federal government needs to be doing that assessment so that you can have an informed ask of the manufacturing community,"" she added. “I’m hoping they’ve been working on it for some time."" Chris Brooks, chief strategy officer for Seattle-area Ventec Life Systems, said he's fielding inquiries and orders from more than 60 countries, including the U.S. government. But with the U.S., he said the focus is still on working out what exactly it needs. “I want to say we’re doing everything we can to ramp up as quickly as possible and to put products in place to be able to make as many [ventilators] as possible,” he said. “Certainly, with a definitive answer about what that need is, we could provide a definitive answer as to whether we could meet that need.” Mulligan said what is required is ""a 50-state breakdown of how many days of personal protective equipment do you have, where your gaps are the biggest."" Then, she added, ""you would identify the manufacturers domestically who produce those items. Do you have the capacity to do more within your current manufacturing capacity? Can you ramp up production? For the last month, we could have been figuring these questions out. There is absolutely no reason why we are starting that now."" In fact, talk of invoking the Defense Production Act to help deal with the current crisis dates back at least to late February. ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting,"" Azar told reporters on Feb. 2. ""So that is an authority that we have, and we intend to use it to acquire anything that we need to acquire."" Azar said he could not specify all the items it will be used to produce but noted, ""of course, we've been very clear in the supplemental of the core items that we've got to do, which is personal protective equipment."" That includes protective equipment for health care workers. ""We've spoken of procuring at least 300 million N95 masks,"" Azar said. ""We need additional gowns ... as well as gloves. So that kind of personal protective equipment most immediately."" Azar also stressed that ""if we need to, we will use it. We won't hesitate."" Trump on Wednesday defended the timing. ""Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators, too,"" he told reporters. ""And when we have thousands of ventilators — it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing."" Others have been pressing the administration to ramp up its special authorities more quickly. ""America is not as ready as we should be,"" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, who co-wrote a letter this week to Trump pressing him to utilize the DPA. ""In France, factories that once manufactured fancy perfumes are starting to churn out needed hand sanitizer instead,"" he said. ""You can’t do these things overnight. It takes planning and coordination. President Trump is finally taking needed steps, but we’ve got to do more."" There could be other delays, however.

"A specter haunts progressive America—the possibility that a private company might make too much money solving the world’s coronavirus problem. True to form, Bernie Sanders expressed this worry in the crudest and most simplistic terms at the last Democratic debate, calling the leaders of the pharmaceutical industry “a bunch of crooks,” who are saying to themselves in the midst of the epidemic, “Wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.” Op-eds have sprung up warning, “Drug Companies Will Make a Killing from Coronavirus” (The New York Times) and “How Big Pharma Will Profit from the Coronavirus” (The Intercept).  This would seem the least of our problems right now, but the pharmaceutical industry has become such a boogeyman that it gets roundly attacked even while racing to provide an indisputable boon to public health.  Bernie’s view that the people running the drug companies are “crooks” betrays his Marxoid belief that profit is a form of theft. Of course, even people who aren’t socialists stuck in amber circa 1930 are great scourges of the industry. Pharma brought much of this on itself with the opioid debacle, which was the product of genuine abuses. Yet these companies routinely create medical miracles for which we all should be grateful and that markedly improve human welfare.  Yes, they make money doing it, but the profit motive is the reason why they exist in the first place.  There’s a reason we introduce more new therapies than any country in the world. When faced with what’s been called a once-in-generation pathogen, would we rather have a robust commercial drug industry or not? Brilliant, creative people scattered throughout companies and universities working to be the first to a solution or not? Investors looking to back promising research, or not?  If your answer to any of these questions is “no,” you are probably a socialist, a populist firing at the wrong targets, or someone incapable of doing basic cost-benefit calculations.  As Chris Pope of the Manhattan Institute notes, if a new drug—even an expensive one—obviates hospital stays and physician care, it can reduce health care costs over time.  Consider the current crisis. The costs of the “medieval” methods we are using to try to control the coronavirus virus are unimaginably high—shutting down swaths of the economy, throwing millions out of work, disrupting air travel and the free movement of people. Gross domestic product could drop 5 percent or more this quarter.  What would we pay for a vaccine to make this all unnecessary? Even if it were a trillion dollars, the price of the Trump-proposed stimulus package, it would be a bargain, saving untold human suffering and economic dislocation. Even if it required cutting a check directly to the most stereotypical mustache-twirling, profiteering-in-a-crisis, uncaring businessman it would be a great deal.  That said, the price for a vaccine probably won’t be exorbitant. The nightmare stories of ungodly expensive treatments usually involve drugs for rare diseases. In these cases, there is a very small base of people who potentially need the drug. Companies therefore charge higher prices to recoup research costs and make a profit. Also, there are unlikely to be any competitors providing a cheaper alternative.  With the coronavirus, there’s an incredibly vast pool of people who will want the vaccine, meaning it can be priced accordingly. Since so many companies are chasing a vaccine, there will almost certainly be competition, putting further downward pressure on the price.  The overall picture of prescription drugs is more complicated than advertised. Chris Pope writes that prescription drugs account for a lower percentage of overall health spending here than in most other advanced countries, and the per capita cost for hospital services has been rising at a much more rapid clip in recent years than the per capita price of prescription drugs. Once new drugs come off patent, cheaper generic drugs arrive. This is why per capita spending on traditional drugs has been declining.  As for patents, the point of them is, as the Constitution puts it, “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” They ensure that companies get the benefit of research that is expensive, time consuming and risky. Success is never guaranteed, and failure more common. Even in the best circumstance, after perhaps spending $2 billion or more on the research process, a company may wait 10 years or more for approval from the Food and Drug Administration.  If a company doesn’t have a period of protection for its intellectual property when it can reap the market benefits, much of this research would dry up. And who’s going to step up and fill the gap?  It’s true that the government provides support for basic research through the National Institutes of Health. That is well and good—and an entirely worthy government project—but it’s not the same as bringing a drug to market.  It is a marvel that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is already working with a Cambridge, Mass., company, Moderna, on a vaccine trail. This is a model of public-private cooperation. Anyone who would want to subtract Moderna from the process because it stands to profit from its work is an ideological zealot heedless of public health.  Drug pricing is a complicated matter and there are, to be sure, more things that the government can be doing to foster competition and keep companies from gaming the system. But this crisis brings home the incalculable value of a world-class pharmaceutical sector. We can shelter in place and try to mitigate the harms of this virus, or hope the “crooks” pursuing treatments and a vaccine make the current disruptions in our national life a thing of the past as soon possible.",Only the ‘Crooks’ of the Pharmaceutical Industry Can Save Us Now,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/only-the-crooks-of-the-pharmaceutical-industry-can-save-us-now-136255,politico
"Coronavirus has finally reached Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a ninth-term Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, a freshman Democrat from Utah, revealed on Wednesday that they had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first U.S. lawmakers to contract the virus that‘s spreading across the country. Diaz-Balart, 58, said he began to develop symptoms on Saturday, just hours after he left the House floor for a vote on a coronavirus response bill. More than 400 members of Congress also voted during the early-Saturday session. Diaz-Balart’s statement indicates he decided to “self-quarantine in Washington D.C.” after the vote. His statement doesn’t indicate why he believed he needed to self-quarantine before developing symptoms or whether he informed staff or other members of Congress that he might have exposed them to the illness. “I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” Diaz-Balart said in the statement. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.” McAdams, 45, also said his symptoms began mildly on Saturday night, after he had returned to Utah. He immediately began self-quarantining on the advice of his doctor. “My symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough and labored breathing and I remained self-quarantined,“ McAdams said in a statement. “On Tuesday, my doctor instructed me to get tested for COVID-19 and following his referral, I went to the local testing clinic for the test. Today I learned that I tested positive.“ Diaz-Balart said he decided to remain in Washington on Saturday because he was concerned about being in his South Florida home, where his wife, who has a pre-existing condition, would be “at exceptionally high risk.” Like Diaz-Balart, McAdams didn‘t indicate whether he had urged any of his colleagues or aides to self-quarantine. The news of two members testing positive has already begun rippling across Congress. Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.) said on Wednesday night that the House doctor had advised him to self-quarantine until March 27 because he “was in contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19.“ The House minority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), said on Wednesday that he, too, would self-quarantine because he had held an “extended meeting“ with Diaz-Balart late last week. Scalise is now the highest-ranking lawmaker to self-quarantine amid the outbreak. Though Diaz-Balart and McAdams are the first in Congress to develop coronavirus, the illness has struck among a small number of congressional aides. It’s sure to heighten already-acute fears on Capitol Hill that members themselves, particularly the high proportion of elderly lawmakers, are vulnerable when they meet in Washington. The development appears likely to revive an internal House debate about whether to permit remote voting for lawmakers amid a pandemic that‘s ravaging the country, pummeling the economy and limiting members‘ ability to travel across the country. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have resisted the idea, worrying that it would set a damaging precedent for the future and signal a lack of confidence from government in the country‘s fight against coronavirus. But with two lawmakers ill and untold others exposed, some lawmakers say it‘s time to think again. “In. Person. Voting. Should. Be. Reconsidered,“ Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a freshman Democrat from Florida, said in a tweet late Wednesday. “For the safety of our communities, during this emergency, we must be able to legislate from our districts.“ Earlier in the day, 50 lawmakers of both parties wrote to House leaders asking them to reconsider remote voting as well, arguing that Congress must hold itself to the same standards it‘s asking of other Americans.",First 2 members of Congress test positive for coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/first-member-of-congress-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-136300,politico
"The Trump administration is considering a controversial proposal to boost the number of visas offered to wealthy immigrants who invest money in the United States as it tries to boost a faltering economy amid the escalating coronavirus outbreak, according to four people familiar with the situation. The proposal, which could be included in one of the Senate’s coronavirus rescue bills, would significantly boost the number of visas offered annually from 10,000 to 75,000 while halving the investment required to earn legal residence from $900,000 to $450,000, they say.  Half the recipients of the EB-5 visa program — investors and their families — come from China, according to a report by the Brookings Institution think tank. Many others come from South Korea and Taiwan. Immigration hardliners, who are generally supportive of President Donald Trump’s policies, oppose the proposal because of concerns about increasing the number of foreigners coming to the U.S., especially from China, which Trump blames for its handling of the coronavirus. “Using a coronavirus package to give more green cards to shady investors from the country where the virus originated would be Washington at its worst,” said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, who has been in touch with the White House and the Senate about the proposal. “If an immigration proposal doesn’t enhance public safety or protect American workers, it doesn’t belong in there. Period.” The proposal comes as the Trump administration is putting temporary holds on other types of visas for lower-income immigrants — including agricultural workers, camp counselors and resort workers — as U.S. unemployment is expected to soar. The administration is also considering reversing its recent decision to increase by 35,000 the number of nonagricultural seasonal workers the U.S. brings in each year, such as landscapers, crab-pickers and lifeguards, two people familiar with the situation say.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump made cracking down on immigration the centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and a top priority of his presidency. “Our country is full,” Trump warned in April, standing at the southern border in California. He has implemented harsh travel restrictions on numerous majority-Muslim nations and cut refugee caps, but he has also backed proposals that would increase the number of immigrants and offer citizenship to some here illegally. The EB-5 program was created in 1990 to boost rural areas and economically distressed urban ones. But in recent years developers have found ways to carve high-income areas into the locations. The program has been used for years by property developers in New York City, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, to oversee projects that have helped create jobs and generate tax revenue, according to a person close to the White House. The Trump administration enacted a new rule in November raising the minimum investment amount and pushing the program to be used in rural and high-unemployment areas. Investments are supposed to lead to the creation of 10 U.S. jobs but that requirement has been interpreted in different ways. The proposed changes are likely to meet resistance from governors in states with large rural populations who believe the program — as it is currently structured — ignores them, according to a second person close to the White House. The proposal indicates immigrants would have to be “cleared first,” but it’s unclear whether that refers to the coronavirus or the immigrants’ investments. It could also address lengthy wait times that have led to a reduction in participation.  Groups that favor immigration restrictions including FAIR and Numbers USA are lobbying senators to keep changes to the program out of their bill and asking supporters across the country to call their senators. “It's ridiculous to think that there are some in Congress who are looking to take advantage of a national health crisis by pushing for a massive increase in the number of green cards made available for foreign investors,” said Chris Chmielenski, deputy director at NumbersUSA, which supports immigration restrictions. “While millions of American workers are concerned about their health and job status, Congress should be focusing on helping them and not selling off green cards.” The expansion is being pushed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a Trump ally who has supported easing restrictions in the past, according to one of the people. His office did not respond to a request for comment. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has long considered the program corrupt and tried to change the system but in 2018 called for it to shut down altogether. “The American people understand that our citizenship is a blessing, and shouldn’t be given away cheaply,” he said on the Senate floor that year. “Unfortunately, for too many years this body has witnessed the perversion and degradation of a program that sells, yes sells, our citizenship.”",Trump considers increasing visas for foreign investors ,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-considers-visas-foreign-investors-135985,politico
"AUSTIN, Texas — Texas is a big state with a proud small-government philosophy. And that’s being tested by the Covid-19 pandemic. Strict bans on public gatherings to curtail the virus' reach and widespread testing and treatment run counter to the politics of top Texas officials. Instead they're calling on local officials to lead the response. As governors in states including New York and California have imposed statewide measures such as closing schools and limiting commerce, Texas leaders have been reluctant to set restrictions conservative voters might consider draconian and business leaders oppose. They’ve also opposed steps to expand health insurance coverage.  Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration Friday — after dozens of states already had done so — and activated the National Guard on Tuesday, after more than a dozen states already had. State officials have yet to impose statewide limits on public gatherings, close schools or beaches or issue a special open enrollment period for health insurance, as California, New York and other big states have. And some health providers say Texas has been slow to boost coronavirus testing capacity and help them meet equipment needs. “In this instance, President Trump is right: Governors need to step up,” Clay Jenkins, a Democrat and Dallas County’s top elected official, said in an interview. “When it comes to stemming the tide of the loss of life that we’re staring at, the governor is in a unique position to act.”  Abbott is fully in charge of the state’s response, because as part of the small-government philosophy, the state’s Legislature meets only in odd years for 140 days. So far, more than 60 coronavirus cases and one death have been confirmed in the state. Abbott said he expects the number of cases to explode next week as more testing capacity comes online and more diagnoses are counted. Abbott, who has been governor for five years, tends to shine in moments of crisis. He’s been relatively hands-off during legislative sessions, but has played an active role in managing during disaster. Abbott earned praise for providing a steady hand during Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017. But the swift-spreading coronavirus public health crisis is catching Texas unprepared. The state, which didn’t expand Medicaid, has the highest uninsured rate in the country meaning millions of people don’t have doctors to call if they show symptoms. And Abbott has opposed local paid sick leave ordinances, which could encourage sick people to stay home and keep from spreading the virus, saying they hamper business growth. “I am pleased that Governor Abbott is engaged in a way that is certainly more substantive than President Trump — but that is such a low bar,” Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett wrote in an emailed statement. “Like Trump, he has shifted responsibility for the toughest decisions to local leaders and declined to provide leadership on limitations and closures. He has provided no leadership on health care access in the state with the most uninsured.” Health providers say the state has been slow to ramp up testing, relying instead on local officials and private companies to step up efforts. About 1,200 people have been tested so far — a fifth of the number that have been tested in California and half the number that have been tested in Minnesota, according to a POLITICO analysis of state tallies. Christopher Crow, president of Dallas-based Catalyst Health Network, said his group of clinics, which serves 1.2 million patients in the state, is ready to roll out Covid-19 testing but lacked protective gear to keep doctors and nurses from becoming infected. On Tuesday evening the group finally got equipment from the national stockpile — enough to last for two or three days of testing.  “We haven’t had to do a 180-degree turn in a moment. That is really hard,” Crow said. “I wish we had more coming from our public officials than we have right now.” Texas isn’t the only state to drag its feet on a response. But the state’s population of 30 million people and its high uninsured rate makes the state a potential hotbed for virus spread. “At some point the needs will overwhelm the health care system” in Texas, said James Hodge, Jr., director for Arizona State University’s center for public health law and policy.  Abbott’s office says the governor believes in taking a decentralized approach letting local officials take the lead in imposing restrictions and relying on private companies to help boost testing capacity. Several Texas cities and counties have already closed schools and limited public gatherings. That includes Austin, which issued an order Tuesday banning gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down restaurants and bars through early May. “County judges and mayors have done a very good job in listening to local health officials,” Abbott’s spokesman John Wittman said in an interview. “What is best in Dallas may not be best for Amarillo or Abilene.” Some local officials say Abbott is responding to conservative Texas voters who will chafe at what they see as overly restrictive measures. “The biggest challenge there is still a lot of people in our communities who are trying to figure out if we are overreacting or underreacting,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park southeast of Houston. The outbreak is coming at the same time as a downturn in oil and gas revenue, a lifeblood for the $110 billion annual Texas budget. While the state has a rainy day fund totaling more than $11 billion, some state lawmakers worry that needs for social services will skyrocket at a moment when state coffers will be emptier. The next session will be “frightening,” said Democratic state Sen. Nathan Johnson. “We are looking at a higher demand for state services and will be less financially able to deliver them.” Johnson added that he hopes the outbreak will spark a conversation about expanding health coverage and paid sick leave policies in the state.  “If we have a stronger, better thought out system of services, I think we can avoid some of the pain the next time around,” he said.

"The coronavirus may do more to unravel U.S.-Chinese ties than trade wars, technology threats and presidential tweets ever did.  The two countries’ relationship — already under enormous pressure in recent years — is on the verge of imploding as both sides seek to assign blame for the virus’ origin and exchange tit-for-tat recriminations on other fronts, including expelling journalists.  The fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability given the importance of both countries to international trade.  Beyond trade, the virus’ spread could even lead to more long-term shifts in how the U.S. and China are perceived. China, which has continued to shore up its military power in the face of longstanding U.S. supremacy, has now begun offering aid to other countries crippled by the virus as a way to showcase its global leadership amid a slow, limited U.S. reaction.  “I cannot think of a more dangerous time in the U.S.-China relationship in the last 40 years, and the carnage from the coronavirus has barely begun in the U.S.,” China analyst Bill Bishop wrote this week in his widely read Sinocism newsletter.  The first phase of the trade deal that the two sides agreed to in December eases, but does not fully eliminate, the tariffs President Donald Trump put into place and has China agreeing to buy some $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years.  China appears to be meeting some of the deal’s deadlines for now, but there are concerns that, given the damage the virus — as well as the trade war — has done to its economy, it may not be able to buy all the U.S. goods as quickly as it had promised. The virus’ effect on U.S. businesses, meanwhile, could dampen some industries’ ability to offer the goods and services China might want. Despite pressure from U.S. businesses, Trump said Wednesday he wouldn’t be suspending tariffs that remain, although the administration has exempted certain medical supplies from the import penalties.  When asked whether he would lift more the penalties, Trump said, “China is paying billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that,” reiterating his incorrect assertion that China, not U.S. businesses and consumers, pays the tariffs. “They haven't even spoken to me. China hasn’t asked me to do that.”  The response and rhetoric surrounding the pandemic is now throwing into question whether the two sides will enter into a second phase of negotiations to address some of the more systemic issues that have plagued the U.S.-China trade relationship.  The virus may prove to be the most compelling reason for the two countries to “decouple” economically, as some of Trump’s hawkish advisers have long wanted. Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that will place new “Buy America” requirements on government purchases of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has been leading the effort, which would attempt to reduce reliance on China for vital drug ingredients and supplies like masks and gloves.  “The problem we’re facing is that any time we have a public health emergency, people wake up to the extreme foreign dependency that we have,” he said. “And after the crisis is over, they promptly go back to sleep.” Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist in Trump’s White House who has long warned about the dangers posed by a rising China, said any goodwill built up as a result of reaching the initial trade deal is now moot. He blamed Beijing’s early actions — when it was accused of trying to cover up the crisis and resisting outside help — for “metastasizing” the pandemic.  “Now you can see they are on a propaganda offensive to blame this on the West, particularly the United States, and it’s going to lead to a further confrontation. There is a confrontation coming,” Bannon said.  He said a confrontation would likely involve an escalation “in the information war and the economic war.” Since the virus began to spread globally, officials on both sides have used social media and other platforms to attack each other.  Trump, for instance, has taken to calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus,” a term critics say is racist and xenophobic. He says Beijing’s ruling Communist Party has left him no choice but to do this because Chinese officials are floating conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 illness began in the U.S. or was planted in China by the U.S. military.  “I have to call it where it came from; it did come from China,” Trump said Tuesday when asked about his use of the “Chinese virus” label. “So I think it’s a very accurate term.” He continued: “I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.” Trump on Wednesday pushed back on mounting criticism for his use of the term, insisting, “It’s not racist at all.” Scientists believe the virus was first spotted in China’s Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan was an epicenter. But as China has, through strict quarantines and other measures, appeared to bring the virus under control, it has gone about trying to fudge that history.  A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Lijian Zhao, has been particularly brash, using Twitter — a platform banned for most Chinese — to share articles and raise questions about whether the U.S. was the origin of the illness.  “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao tweeted on March 12.  The Washington-Beijing clash is going well beyond just rhetoric.  China said this week that it is expelling American journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. It also announced new restrictions on several U.S.-based outlets including Voice of America.  American reporters have been among the most aggressive in covering the coronavirus outbreak in China, as well as other issues deemed sensitive there.  China said it was merely taking reciprocal action after the Trump administration recently announced new restrictions on Chinese media outlets in America, including capping the number of Chinese citizens working for them. The Trump administration also has designated several Chinese media outlets as foreign missions — effectively treating them as arms of the Chinese government, which plenty of analysts say is a fair characterization.  In a briefing with reporters Wednesday, a senior State Department official defended the Trump administration’s approach in high altitude terms, saying that for decades the U.S. has tried to build a “normal relationship” with China, but that the Chinese have taken advantage of America’s relatively open system without offering similar access.  “For the last 40 years, you can characterize a relationship of them competing while we’ve been trying to cooperate. This administration has understood that this is a relationship characterized by strategic competition,” the official said. Many public health experts have raised alarms about the U.S.-China rhetoric and reciprocal actions during the coronavirus crisis.  They argue that now is not the time for either side to insult the other, because working together will help speed up efforts to contain the virus across the world.  And the U.S., to its credit, has sent tons of humanitarian aid to China and offered millions in additional assistance to help it fight the virus. Trump himself has avoided criticizing Chinese leader Xi Jinping directly. It’s a cautious approach he’s long taken despite the trade war and other scuffles, apparently believing that keeping a strong personal relationship with Xi could pay off down the line. In January, when Trump was downplaying the spread of the illness, he even thanked Xi in a tweet praising China for “working very hard” to contain the coronavirus. But Trump aides feel they cannot allow the Chinese to rewrite history. In a phone call with a senior Chinese foreign policy official earlier this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned “that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,” according to a State Department readout.  While some Democrats have blasted the Trump administration and its supporters for its heated rhetoric toward China, there’s strong bipartisan support in Washington for the broader idea that the U.S. needs to be tougher on China. And there are plenty of signs that sentiment isn’t on pause amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers have sent legislation to Trump that allows for paying rural telecom carriers $1 billion to eliminate and replace materials in their networks that come from Huawei and ZTE. Both are Chinese telecommunications firms that U.S. officials fear could be a means of exposing U.S. networks to Chinese hacking and spying.  In mid-February, the U.S. Department of Justice filed racketeering and conspiracy charges against Huawei and some of its subsidiaries, alleging they were trying to steal trade secrets from American companies.  The Chinese Communist Party, which saw its reputation dealt a major blow over its initial handling of the virus within its borders, is now trying to capitalize on its recent successes containing the illness’ spread.  China has sent experts to assist Italy as it battles severe outbreaks of the virus, while offering assistance to Spain. It has pledged to send at least 100,000 test kits to the Philippines. And it has made clear, through actions and pledges, that it will help other nations that need it.  Chinese charities have also stepped up to offer assistance to other countries, including the United States. In requesting Beijing’s assistance, Serbia’s president declared this week: “The only country that can help us is China.”  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Wednesday that the Chinese government would be donating 2 million surgical masks, 200,000 N95 masks and 50,000 testing kits to the European Union.  “This support is highly valued and we are grateful for it,” she said.  It’s clear that Beijing sees itself filling a global leadership role that would traditionally be held by the United States, but which, under Trump’s “America First” philosophy, appears vacant.  Chinese state-controlled media websites are filled with stories about the U.S. struggle to control the virus in its borders. They’re also filled with stories about Chinese leader Xi offering words of comfort to his counterparts abroad.  “Sunshine always comes after the rain,” Xi said, according to a Chinese media report of his conversation with Spain’s prime minister.

"General Motors is studying whether to retool its shuttered production lines to make ventilators and other needed medical equipment to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, company officials said Wednesday. GM CEO Mary Barra was in contact with administration officials on Wednesday updating them on a decision to suspend production for the rest of the month. “She also indicated GM is working to help find solutions for the nation during this difficult time and has offered to help, and we are already studying how we can potentially support production of medical equipment like ventilators,” a GM spokesperson told POLITICO. The U.S. faces a shortage of life-saving ventilators if patients infected with Covid-19, a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, overwhelm U.S. hospitals. President Donald Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act, which will allow him to direct domestic manufacturers to produce medical supplies and other necessary items during the crisis. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday that he was in touch with leaders of two of the three major U.S. automakers. Ford and Fiat Chrysler also said they would suspend production of automobiles until at least March 30. “One of them told me that even though the men and women may be off for two weeks due to the virus, she’s going to try to call them back so they can produce ventilators,” Kudlow said on Fox News, in an apparent reference to Barra, the only female CEO of a major U.S. auto company. “They might even ask them to do it on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons,” he said. The auto industry in Canada has also expressed a willingness to produce necessary medical supplies for demand in that country. “We’ve got the capacity to make things from simple one-shot molds to complex assemblies. We make 500,000 of something every year, a thousand a day,” said Flavio Volpe, president of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. “The country needs masks, gowns, goggles, ventilators. Can we assign some of our capacity to be able to help the cause,” he said in an interview with CBC. “The response has been overwhelming from auto parts makers. We’re in, just get us the specs.”",Auto industry could shift to make ventilators,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/auto-industry-could-shift-to-make-ventilators-136256,politico
"Can the state tell your favorite local restaurant to close, or tell you that you must stay at home unless it’s absolutely necessary to leave, because of an emergency? The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have closed down bars, movie theaters and dine-in restaurants. Six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area have imposed a shelter-in-place order that allows people to leave their homes only for essential activities. In response to these drastic measures intended to slow down the spread of coronavirus, there are plenty of voices on social media, and even some in government, denouncing such measures as unprecedented, un-American and unconstitutional. Most of us have never imagined such impositions outside of a situation of armed conflict, but allegations that those measures in the current circumstances are unlawful are wrong. And this is a case where legal misinformation can exacerbate a public health crisis. States—and their cities and counties by extension—possess what has long been known as a “police power” to govern for the health, welfare and safety of their citizens. This broad authority, which can be traced to English common law and is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment, is far from radical; it justifies why states can regulate at all. The police power of the states has been invoked on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court, often in contrast to the limited powers of the federal government—for example, in Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in the 2012 Obamacare case. This power also has been recognized in the context of public health for decades. In a 1905 Supreme Court case that upheld mandatory smallpox vaccinations, the court observed that “upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” What does this mean for the drastic coronavirus responses we’re seeing across the country? State and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary. (Thankfully, with COVID-19, we have so far seen mostly peaceful, even if begrudging, compliance to “flatten the curve” so that our health care workers and hospitals are not overwhelmed.) But, you might ask, don’t I have individual rights, even in a pandemic? Of course you do. We possess constitutionally protected rights to assemble and travel, for instance. State and local governments must be careful to make sure that measures they impose to protect people are not overly broad and are taken only for justifiably important reasons. Our legal history is filled with cases where government has had insufficiently important reasons to justify restrictive measures, or where the measures themselves are overly broad. Or even cases where government restrictions turn out to have been implemented for impermissibly discriminatory reasons, such as when the city of San Francisco targeted only its Chinese residents in a bubonic plague outbreak in 1900. Not all exercises of the police power will withstand constitutional scrutiny. But the very existence of this framework—the balance between the need to protect the public and individual rights—assumes that there will be times when there are truly compelling emergencies justifying severe measures. A global pandemic that spreads even among those who are asymptomatic and could exceed the capacity of the American health care system would appear to be just such a compelling situation. When prominent voices tell the public that these drastic measures are somehow inherently unlawful or obviously unconstitutional, they detract from the social solidarity we need right now. People who are misled about what the government may do, and confused about its established powers, might not take heed of the necessary measures to protect their own health and that of their communities. At some point in the future, we could see a coronavirus response that has gone on too long or is too broad to justify its burdens. Or we might see instances of people who were denied civil liberties without real justification. Even now, you might feel that these measures are too little, too late, or that they are drastic, and burdensome. But if we are facing a window of opportunity that is rapidly closing, to say that the states cannot try to use their most basic authority to save lives is not only wrong—it might be deadly.","Yes, States and Local Governments Can Close Private Businesses and Restrict Your Movement",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/states-police-power-coronavirus-135826,politico
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that his company is stepping up its efforts to combat misinformation about the coronavirus — but has not received requests from governments worldwide to turn over its users' data. Speaking to reporters by phone, Zuckerberg said discussions in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere have focused on ways that Facebook could combat misinformation connected to Covid-19, and not on how governments could use people’s digital information to combat the virus. “I don’t think it would make sense to share people’s data if people haven’t opted in for that,” he said. “At a high level, the answer is probably no,” Zuckerberg added in response to questions about whether he would be open to such data sharing with government agencies. Facebook already partners with public health organizations to monitor global diseases based on data from users who have opted to share their location information, he said. European governments, privacy regulators, telecom operators and digital companies have been considering reducing global data protection standards in recent days so officials can access large amounts of social media data to model how the coronavirus is spreading. U.S. authorities have also had discussions with companies like Facebook and Google about how their data could aid in the virus response, according to some news reports, although White House officials have told POLITICO they have not requested data on the companies' users. The big online companies possess a wealth of information on their billions of users, include their travels, friendships, interests and even diet and exercise habits. But while some of that data could be useful for public health efforts like the virus response, the companies are also wary of retriggering the same alarms about privacy violations that have triggered outcries and investigations in both the U.S. and Europe. In recent weeks, false reports have spread on Facebook's messaging platform WhatsApp as people seek information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp has limited the ability of people to forward digital messages, a move that has helped reduce the spread of falsehoods. He said governments have not ramped up pressure to reduce its encryption levels to combat coronavirus misinformation, but added that his company would not change its policy on so-called end-to-end encryption. Countries like the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom have consistently called for the company to alter its stance on encryption, in part to tackle online terrorist content. “We really believe there are other ways to get at preventing harm that are more effective than getting rid of encryption,” Zuckerberg said. Facebook has also come under pressure to clamp down on the spread of false reports across its main platform and Instagram as well, and Zuckerberg announced several new initiatives that would be rolled out in the coming days. Facebook’s latest response efforts include a “coronavirus information center” that will be added to the top of users’ news feeds with links to reputable information about the illness and the websites of government health agencies. That would start to show up on people’s social media pages in the U.S. and Europe in the next 24 hours, and will be updated as public health officials release new information, Zuckerberg said. The company is also making its enterprise software, called Workplace, available to governments and emergency organizations free for the next year to help them more easily communicate while working remotely. Zuckerberg, who like many people in the U.S. is now working from home, empathized with the fact that such arrangements are proving difficult for his workers and others across the country. “It’s a huge change to work from home, especially with the schools all closed and there are kids around,” he told reporters. “It’s a difficult and stressful time for people.” Among those working from home now are scores of content moderators who are tasked with identifying and removing the platform's most harmful or obscene content. Zuckerberg acknowledged that some content moderation tasks can’t be carried out from home, meaning Facebook will rely more heavily on artificial intelligence systems with varying degrees of accuracy. The company will also shift more moderators to look for content that indicates a user may be considering suicide or self-harm as increased isolation during the coronavirus outbreak could have an impact on mental health, he said. The challenge comes as Facebook is also experiencing peak usage, eclipsing high-traffic moments like midnight on New Year’s Eve, the result of more people being physically isolated from friends and family. ""We really need to make sure we're on top of this from an infrastructure perspective, to make sure that things don't melt down, and can continue to provide the level of service that people need in a time like this,” Zuckerberg said.",Zuckerberg: Governments have not asked for user data for coronavirus fight,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/mark-zuckerberg-coronavirus-user-data-136028,politico
"The FDA is so desperate for information about shortages in coronavirus testing supplies that it is turning to an unlikely source of information: Twitter. Wading into the Wild West of social media for help during a global pandemic may seem unsophisticated for an agency charged with regulating the nation’s drugs and medical devices. But thanks to a decades-old law, the FDA cannot require device manufacturers to report shortages in the same way it can for drugmakers. This fundamental gap in the flow of information has made it difficult for the FDA to identify weaknesses in the supply chain for coronavirus testing and in the nationwide push to test hundreds of thousands of patients. The agency is responsible for regulating coronavirus tests used by U.S. laboratories. So the FDA is making plaintive appeals on Twitter, in addition to negotiating with companies behind the scenes. “@US_FDA suggests companies make public their inventory, production schedule and a hotline number to address questions regarding availability of reagents and other supplies needed for #COVID19 testing,” Anand Shah, the agency’s deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs, tweeted on March 17. “If you have an allocation plan to maximize efficient testing, please post.” The FDA is seeking information about swabs, test kits, instruments and supplies for transporting and preparing samples for analysis, Shah said in a subsequent tweet that tagged the @FDADeviceInfo account. A spokesperson for the medical device trade lobby AdvaMed told POLITICO that it is working with the FDA “to find the best way to ensure the appropriate information gets to the FDA during this time of crisis.” The Trump administration has sought to tighten rules for device makers in recent years, bringing them in line with the regulations that require drug manufacturers to warn the government when a shortage seems likely — and how long it could last. The president’s 2020 budget request proposed requiring device-makers to tell the FDA if a significant interruption of essential products was likely, and to file regular reports on their manufacturing capacity. Similar plans have been gaining steam in Congress. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill in February to bolster FDA’s authority to monitor device shortages, and Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) unveiled similar legislation in March. But with those proposals in legislative limbo, the agency may have to get creative to track potential shortages at a time when countries around the world are competing for the same basic testing supplies. Michael Heyl, a medical device attorney at Hogan Lovells, says that the FDA can glean clues from lists of approved device suppliers to get a window into where companies source materials. “Those are all available to FDA for review upon inspection,” Heyl said. “An argument can be made that at least who the suppliers are is something that FDA has the ability to see.” Others argue that a global crisis is not the time to change the rules for device manufacturers. “There's a balance that has to be struck between giving that information to FDA and creating additional reporting requirements in a time where people can't quite keep up with all that they're required to do already in terms of getting these tests up and running,” said Scott Danzis, an attorney at Covington & Burling who specializes in medical diagnostics. In the meantime, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told reporters this week that the agency is monitoring the stock of testing supplies and personal protective equipment “very closely.” “There is pressure on the supply chain with respect to the reagents, swabs, or transport media that are needed to perform these tests,” Hahn said. “We have been leaning in with manufacturers — both of the tests, but also of these other supplies that are needed.”",FDA turns to Twitter to help track testing supply shortages,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/fda-twitter-coronavirus-testing-136014,politico
"Bill Weld ended his quixotic primary campaign against President Donald Trump on Wednesday after winning only a single delegate in the 2020 contest.  ""While I am suspending my candidacy, I want to be clear that I am not suspending my commitment to the nation and to the democratic institutions that set us apart,"" Weld wrote in an email to supporters.  Weld, the former two-term Massachusetts governor, pitched himself as an anti-Trump, pro-choice former prosecutor who supported cutting taxes and combating climate change. He backed Trump's impeachment, and was among a handful of Republicans who ran for the nomination and dropped out over the course of the election cycle.  Weld won a single delegate in Iowa, but had trouble competing with Trump's popularity among the GOP base. Weld was also hampered by Republican rules that use a winner-take-all formula to award delegates, including in his native Massachusetts. Weld's exit from the race means Trump is now the party's presumptive nominee — though it was never really in doubt. Trump amassed the number of delegates needed to win the party's nomination on Tuesday night after polls closed in Illinois, Arizona and Florida.  ""Nobody motivates our base more than President Trump, as evidenced by the historic turnout we've seen in state after state this primary season,"" said RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""[We] are thrilled to have President Trump as our party’s presumptive nominee once again."" Weld ran for vice president as a Libertarian in 2016, alongside former presidential candidate Gary Johnson. In the days leading up to the general election in 2016, Weld encouraged voters to choose Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump. The former Massachusetts governor re-registered as a Republican in 2019 to run for president.  Announcing the end of his campaign, Weld thanked his ""tens of thousands of supporters and donors.""  ""I am intensely grateful to all the patriotic women and men who have stood with me and supported me during the past eleven months in our effort to bring better government to Washington, D.C.,"" Weld said.",Weld ends long-shot bid for GOP nomination,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/bill-weld-ends-2020-campaign-135951,politico

"Ford and General Motors are halting production at all North American plants through March 30, the companies confirmed today. GM said production status would be reevaluated week-to-week after March 30.  Ford temporarily closed the Michigan Assembly Plant final assembly building earlier today after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus. The company is instructing those who had direct contact with the employee to self-quarantine and seek medical attention. All other plants will close after Thursday evening‘s shifts. In a statement, Ford said manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico will be closed so they can be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized and to protect workers from the spread of the novel coronavirus. GM said its plants will be closing “in a cadence, with each facility receiving specific instructions from manufacturing leadership.“ Leaders from the companies and the United Auto Workers will work together on plans to restart production in compliance with social distancing protocols among workers, including at shift change times, and to maximize cleaning times between shifts changes. UAW President Rory Gamble called the temporary shutdown “prudent,” giving leaders time to “review best practices“ to prevent the spread of the virus. Ford, UAW, GM and Fiat Chrysler announced Sunday they were forming a Coronavirus Task Force “to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies.“ The Associated Press has reported that FCA is also shuttering plants in Michigan but FCA did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. Ford is also closing manufacturing sites in Germany and Romania. A Ford plant in Spain already halted production Monday after three workers were diagnosed with the coronavirus over the weekend.","Ford, GM to halt North American production ",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/coronavirus-ford-gm-halting-production-135917,politico
"The White House has issued a “temporary pause” on congressional testimony for senior officials involved in the coronavirus response, according to correspondence obtained by POLITICO — a move that has some House Democrats complaining about stonewalling even as they acknowledge the need to give health officials space to manage the crisis. The halt in high-level officials appearing at hearings is slated to last through the end of the month and is intended, according to the March 16 letter, to ensure that the Trump administration is “directly focused on executing its day-to-day response to COVID-19.” “Due to the full Administration mobilization underway, we are instituting a temporary pause with respect to the involvement in hearings of government witnesses who are engaged in the coronavirus response,” Cassidy Hutchinson, a White House legislative affairs official, wrote to top House committee aides. “Right now, the Executive Branch needs all of its resources directly focused on executing its day-to-day response to COVID-19.” “This pause is effective immediately. It is intended to last for three weeks, through the end of March,” Hutchinson added, emphasizing that the administration would “continue to offer full transparency to Congress and the American people.” The letter has prompted grousing among congressional Democrats, who say that while they understand the urgency facing the administration, the move closely followed explosive testimony to the Oversight Committee from top Trump health officials that shed a negative light on the administration’s handling of the crisis. In particular, lawmakers note, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci told lawmakers last week that there had been a “failing” by the government to implement testing early in the spread of the illness. “It’s no coincidence that the White House ordered key officials to stop testifying before Congress right after Dr. Fauci warned the Oversight Committee that the Trump Administration’s testing program is failing,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), a member of the oversight panel. Democrats also say Fauci’s testimony directly played a role in convincing the NBA to suspend its season, an example of the profound impact sworn testimony from senior health officials can have on decision-makers going forward. The Oversight committee’s chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, (D-N.Y.) said she hoped to be able to “work with the Administration in a reasonable way to make sure Dr. Fauci and other key officials are allowed to continue providing information to Congress in this critical period, even as we recognize the key functions they are serving.” “Congress plays a critical role to ensure all federal resources are used effectively and efficiently in this time of crisis, especially when state and local entities are saying they do not have what they need to fight this pandemic,” Maloney added. A senior administration official emphasized that the pause in public testimony would be brief and would not preclude other forms of information-sharing with Congress. “Agencies that are involved in the coronavirus response are working with Congressional committees to postpone hearings temporarily while they fully focus their resources on the mission,” said a senior administration official. “The Administration will continue to practice ‘radical transparency’ with Congress and the American people during this public health emergency.” The White House has been holding near-daily press briefings to provide updates on the coronavirus response. And Fauci is far from silenced; he’s been a ubiquitous presence on television, appearing on multiple Sunday news shows and giving interviews. In addition, lawmakers themselves don’t appear to be clamoring to hold any public hearings in the near-term. The House is in a long-planned weeklong recess while leaders work with the Senate on a massive economic stimulus package, and House officials have recommended that members and staff practice social distancing for the foreseeable future, limiting the prospect of gathering for high-profile public hearings. However, House Democrats say direct communication between lawmakers and senior officials remains crucial during the crisis. The frustration voiced by some Democrats captures a lingering tension between the Trump administration and the House, which has been seeking additional documents and information about the administration’s pandemic preparation. For example, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), whose state had one of the earliest cases of the virus, has been requesting information from CDC on testing capacity, and says the response he's received has been ""incomplete and still fails to give us a complete picture of the country’s ability to process coronavirus tests.""  House Democratic aides say they’ve also struggled to get detailed information on decision-making surrounding the availability of coronavirus tests; whether the administration heeded warnings from public health experts in January; and other important questions about the early days of the crisis. But they also acknowledge that senior officials should be focused on handling the immediate challenges the nation is facing, especially while experts urge Americans to stay home when possible. “We’ve also been trying to give them distance to respond to the outbreak,” said one House Democratic aide. “So, we’re going to have a long list of questions after this is over.” “Hopefully this won’t look like pointing fingers,” said another Democratic aide, who agreed that the House plans to ramp up oversight after the immediate crisis subsides. “America is in the emergency room right now. We’re trying to stabilize the patient first.”",White House pauses testimony for officials handling coronavirus response,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/white-house-coronavirus-officials-testimony-135806,politico
"Last week, to protect the Supreme Court from coronavirus, Chief Justice John Roberts banned visitors and then this week postponed hearing oral arguments altogether. But the virus isn’t the only thing endangering the court, and the chief justice should also take steps to protect the institution. Last month, President Donald Trump questioned the impartiality of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, suggesting they recuse themselves from cases involving him. Earlier this month, while addressing a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building, Sen. Chuck Schumer seemingly threatened Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, saying the two would “pay the price” for their conservative decisions. Roberts issued a swift public statement admonishing Schumer for politicizing the court, and Schumer responded by accusing Roberts of deliberately misinterpreting his comments while staying silent about Trump’s similar rhetoric. In fact, Roberts has been fighting against the perceived political leanings of judges for some time. In 2018, in response to Trump’s claim that “Obama judges” rule against his administration’s policies, Roberts rebutted that there are no “Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.”  But if Roberts is serious about protecting his fellow jurists from future political attacks, then he must do more than issue stern statements of disapproval. Instead, he should reconsider the way the court conveys its decisions to the public. Specifically, he should make per curiam opinions—anonymous opinions, issued without disclosing the identity of the authoring judge or the voting blocs’ membership—the new standard. Per curiam opinions circumvent the political cues associated with a given justice’s identity and instead allow the court to present its holdings as an institution. Not only would this shield the justices from being targeted as individuals, but research also shows that it would strengthen public support for the court’s decisions. From the Supreme Court’s perspective, political attacks against its members are worrisome, no matter who levies them. Without a mechanism to enforce its holdings, the Supreme Court must rely on the other political branches to respect its decisions. Critiques that frame the court’s behavior as political can erode its perception as a legitimate institution. And without widely accepted public deference, the court is powerless. The court has issued per curiam opinions throughout its history, although its use of these opinions has been far from methodical, ranging from landmark cases to the mundane with no rhyme or reason up to now as to why. Systematically removing the identity of the opinions’ authors would convey several benefits. First, peer-reviewed research, conducted by myself and several coauthors, has shown that the use of per curiam opinions strengthens the level of support decisions receive. In a series of survey experiments, we held constant a court opinion’s content—that is, the actual legal holding of the case—but we randomized the identity of the authoring justice. In one study, we investigated whether support for a given case was conditioned on the ideology of the authoring justice. In another, we sought to gauge whether the use of per curiam opinions garnered more support compared to cases with an identified author. In both instances, we found that individuals adjust their level of agreement based on their perception of the opinion author rather than the case disposition itself, and per curiam opinions garnered the greatest level of support of all. Second, from a practical standpoint, there would be no way for a political actor to target an individual justice for a disagreeable per curiam opinion. Being unable to target a single justice leaves only the Supreme Court—as an institution—as a possible target. And the risk that such general attacks will spark an institutional crisis for the court is low, because the public has long held the court as a whole in high regard, at least compared with Congress and the Executive, irrespective of the opinions they may hold toward individual justices. The court currently enjoys its highest level of approval since 2009—despite being entangled in pronounced Senate gamesmanship since Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing in 2016. Even among those who view the court as more of a political institution than a legal one, research indicates that individuals are reluctant to support drastic political reprisals against the court and its justices, such as efforts to “pack” the court or to impeach justices. And even those more extensive reforms would only exacerbate the particularized attacks by politicians against individual justices, which Roberts has described as “inappropriate” and “dangerous.”  Instituting the norm of per curiam opinions would be easy because the Supreme Court already issues such holdings, albeit infrequently. Since 2013, from six to 14 cases per term have been per curiam majority opinions, and so far this term these opinions account for three of the court’s 14 holdings. Per curiam opinions are distributed fairly evenly across issue areas, and the voting blocs within these types of cases vary from 5-4 splits to unanimous decisions and everything in between. Whether or not a case will be decided per curiam is within the chief justice’s control. And to be sure, these sorts of opinions up to now have not been reserved for inconsequential or unimportant cases. Bush v. Gore is but one example of a per curiam majority opinion used in a prominent, highly political case. Chief Justice John Marshall, during the court’s infancy, established the norm of announcing a decision via a single Opinion of the Court, penned by a justice in the majority—rather than a series of opinions written by each member of the bench. (Thomas Jefferson supported the prior setup of “seriatim” opinions, which still, on rare occasion, are used today.) In the same way, Roberts can establish a new norm of per curiam opinions.  Some critics have spoken out in the past against the use of per curiam opinions, claiming this form of legal decision skirts the notion of judicial accountability. But this critique glosses over a cornerstone principle of our constitutional framework: judicial independence. The reason the Constitution grants Supreme Court justices life tenure—rather than connecting them to the populace through regular elections—is to ensure that they are able to make decisions free from outside influences, especially political pressure. Our system of government allows for the judiciary to be checked by constitutional amendments, not individualized, political finger-pointing. What’s more, the use of per curiam opinions does not forgo internal accountability from within the court. Dissenting opinions may still be used by the minority bloc as an effective method for calling the public’s attention to any flaws or shortcomings in the per curiam majority opinion’s reasoning, consequently laying the groundwork for future legal challenges. The politicization of the Supreme Court by outside actors, and the popular discourse it creates, stands in stark contrast with the court’s reality. Since Roberts was confirmed as chief justice in 2005, 79 percent of cases have been decided by something other than a 5-4 split, and unanimous decisions have been the most common.  Of course, justices may be averse to changing the deep-rooted tradition of issuing signed opinions. And there’s no doubt, as Ginsburg herself notes, that disclosing “votes and opinion writers may nourish a judge’s ego,” so directing justices to cede the renown that can accompany authoring revered decisions may be a tall order. But there’s also little reason to suspect political attacks against the Supreme Court will stop any time soon without intervention. Protracted politicization puts the court on tenuous footing, and the chief justice can do more to act on his presumably sincere desire to insulate the court’s members from further political targeting. The exclusive use of per curiam opinions would erect a formidable defense against such future attacks while cementing the chief justice’s legacy as a vigilant protector of “the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court” that he so long ago promised to be.",The One Change John Roberts Can Make to Depoliticize the Supreme Court,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/john-roberts-political-supreme-court-opinions-135769,politico
"Senate Democrats and unions appear to be hardening their desire to attach strings to airline aid for coronavirus relief, and Wednesday slammed the White House’s $50 billion proposal for airlines, calling for stricter limits on executive bonuses, stock buybacks and even carbon emissions. The White House package would allow $50 billion in secured loans for the airline industry with limits on increases in executive compensation until they are repaid, according to a memo by the Treasury Department. But the head of one of the biggest U.S. unions for flight attendants scoffed in response. ""Is this a joke?"" tweeted Sara Nelson, the head of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA in response to the White House plan. ""No more buybacks. No more bonuses. We need to make sure money goes to workers — period."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he wouldn’t support $50 billion in loans to airlines unless more conditions are attached. Along with “really severe limits on executive compensation,” Blumenthal said there should be “conditions that protect workers.” He said pilots and flight attendants should have “better working conditions” and higher pay and that airlines must “commit to do better” in terms of charges, fees, baggage handling and seat size. Earlier Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also targeted airline stock buybacks in comments on the Senate floor. The practice has attracted criticism from progressive Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after the airline industry requested a nearly $60 billion bailout from Congress this week, including $29 billion in grants and another $29 billion in loans or loan guarantees. “One of the reasons, let’s not forget, that many airlines are so short of cash right now is they spent billions on stock buybacks — money they had to send out when they should have been saving it for a rainy day, for their workers and customers,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “That issue should be addressed.” Later, Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told POLITICO that demands could also include limits on executive pay and provisions that would see taxpayers take on stock in airlines, similar to how the government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. ""If we do anything like that, it would have to be done on a business-like basis, which would be demanding preferred shares in the company, so when they recover, taxpayers will get the benefit of the investment,"" Reed (D-R.I.) said. ""We have restrictions on share buybacks, on dividends, on executive pay, we make sure their workforce is treated fairly, that they're not the victims of this after use of our resources — similar to some of the things we did with the banks Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said she wanted to ensure that airplane mechanics aren't put out of work, saying ""the last time this happened, we wiped out the heavy repair industry and all those jobs went to Mexico and Brazil."" ""The last time we helped out the airlines we didn’t actually put any guardrails around some of this money, whether it’s task credits for repair work — so the maintenance companies actually went out of business,"" she added. ""The airlines came back but all of those maintenance jobs went overseas and we need to make sure that we keep those jobs here. So the MROs, the maintenance repair operators, they need to be protected as well."" Some Senate Republicans have cringed at the idea of “bailing out” industry, but on Wednesday, a key Republican appeared open to the idea of providing loans. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he “would have some real concerns” about a “bailout” for the airline industry, but loans are “different.” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who leads the Senate’s transportation spending panel, said she has spoken with some airlines and she has “no doubt that this is a financial crisis for them.” “And I think, given their importance to our economy, and to our eventual recovery, that we are going to have to provide some sort of assistance — whether it should be in the form of loans, secured loans, I’m not sure yet,” Collins said. Separately, a group of eight Democratic senators led by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, wrote to congressional leadership today asking them to include provisions pushing the airline sector to cut carbon emissions in any aid package. The sector produces about 2.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions today. “Given the poor records of some companies in these industries, we believe that any such financial assistance should be paired with requirements that companies act in a more responsible fashion,” read the letter, also signed by Sens. Martin Heinrich (N.M.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (Ct.), Tina Smith (Minn.) and Debbie Stabenow (Mich.).

"The stock market’s latest plunge on Wednesday did more than wipe out billions of dollars in investor equity. It also nearly obliterated President Donald Trump’s favorite measure of his economic success. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's decline below 20,000 almost completely erased all of the iconic index's previous gains since Trump's inauguration, jeopardizing a key talking point for his reelection campaign. Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 fell by more than 7 percent, triggering a marketwide trading halt. Since his 2016 victory, Trump has tweeted dozens of times about the record stock gains under his watch, posting as recently as Feb. 19 that it was the “Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!” He has repeatedly suggested that Americans check their 401(k)s to tote up their gains, and argued that the markets would have crashed had Hillary Clinton defeated him. Now the upheaval sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with plunging oil prices and fears that shares were already inflated, has panicked investors, sending the Dow below the 19,827 where it stood on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Trump was inaugurated. Stocks pared their losses late in the day, and the Dow closed at 19,904. Trump, for his part, always uses the election as the starting point, noting that the market surged the morning after the results were in. The Dow closed at 18,332, on Nov. 8, 2016, Election Day. Trump's top economic aides have also eagerly made the connection between the health of the stock market and the success of his presidency. In a CNBC interview a month after Trump’s inauguration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he “absolutely” views the stock market as a “report card” for the administration. The stock plunge underscores the risk Trump took in tying his presidential reputation to stock prices, which can go down as easily as they can go up, and in any case are only one indicator of the health of the economy. President Barack Obama, for instance, oversaw one of the longest bull runs ever in the markets, but economic growth averaged just a tepid 1.6 percent through his two terms in office. “Letting equity markets grade your performance is perilous, and this is why,” said Tony Fratto, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and a former Treasury Department official. “Markets are fickle. There are things far beyond your control.” “They can point to the coronavirus and say the market was great except for that, but it may be a long time before the market recovers,” he added. “And now they have to shift to focusing on underlying fundamentals, which is what they should have been focused on all along.” The more than 6 percent drop in the Dow today comes after weeks of whipsawing prices in markets, including three more times in the past couple of weeks where stocks dropped enough that it triggered a “circuit breaker” that caused a halt in trading for 15 minutes. Stocks could fall further as investors continue to seek more dramatic action from the administration and Congress to shore up the economy.","Dow tumbles again, nearly wiping out gains of Trump’s presidency",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/donald-trump-stock-market-dip-135807,politico
"President Donald Trump said Wednesday the Department of Housing and Urban Development will suspend foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration until the end of April, a move that will affect about 8.1 million mortgages. The Federal Housing Finance Agency also ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the companies behind about half of the nation’s $11 trillion mortgage market, to suspend foreclosures and evictions for any single-family mortgages they back for “at least 60 days,” the agency said.  Trump's move, announced at a White House press conference, is part of a broad-based response by the administration to the fallout from the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, which threatens to shut down large swaths of the economy and has wreaked havoc in many countries overseas. FHFA Director Mark Calabria said the foreclosure and eviction suspension will allow people ""to stay in their homes during this national emergency,” Fannie and Freddie ""are working with mortgage servicers to ensure that borrowers facing hardship because of the coronavirus can get assistance,” Calabria said in a statement, adding that those borrowers should get in touch with their mortgage servicers as quickly as possible. Calabria told economists on a conference call this afternoon that the agency is seeking to help both those borrowers affected by the virus and those who were struggling to make payments before the outbreak. Out of a public health concern, he said, Fannie and Freddie would make sure people who were already behind on their mortgages aren’t evicted and put on the street in the middle of a pandemic. HUD Deputy Secretary Brian Montgomery said he has not been in any discussions with the Trump administration about urging commercial lenders to suspend mortgage payments in the crisis. Italy suspended mortgage payments last week. Montgomery said the FHA has a “robust set of tools” to deal with turmoil in the housing market in a crisis, noting they’ve suspended foreclosures and evictions before at a regional level in the wake of natural disasters like hurricanes. “For the time being, it just hits the pause button and provides steadiness to the housing market,” Montgomery said in a phone interview. “This is a first step; people who were concerned about [losing their homes] can cross that off their list for now.” The FHFA earlier this month had announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would provide payment forbearance — allowing mortgage payments to be suspended for up to a year — to borrowers hit by the outbreak. The two government-owned enterprises also reminded mortgage servicers that hardship forbearance is an option for borrowers unable to make payments. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Kathy Kraninger, the chief official tasked with helping consumers struggling with the economic fallout from the outbreak, released a statement today praising the housing agencies for the suspensions. The bureau has “encouraged financial institutions to work with their customers affected by the coronavirus,” Kraninger said in an email. “Consumers’ first stop in the face of hardship is with their creditors and their financial institutions, so our message was important for regulated entities to hear,” she added.","HUD, Fannie, Freddie suspend foreclosures, evictions during outbreak",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/hud-suspends-foreclosures-evictions-coronavirus-135783,politico
"U.S. stock exchanges temporarily halted trading Wednesday, as coronavirus fears again sent stock prices plummeting in a massive selloff. Shortly before 1 p.m., the S&P 500 index hit the 7 percent decline needed to trigger a mandatory 15-minute break under Securities and Exchange Commission trading rules. It was the fourth mandatory break in two weeks as economic damage from the virus has triggered a punishing series of trading runs. As was the case on Monday, pre-market trading had already shown signs of strain in stock futures. By the time markets opened, all three major indices — the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index — had dropped 5 percent, hitting the maximum allowable selloff for futures before the start of trading. That outlook persisted despite the fact the White House spoke Monday and Tuesday of plans for spending hundreds of billions of dollars to help ease the economic damage caused by virus-related shutdowns and layoffs. And the Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced significant expansions in lending from a stabilization fund to make sure creditworthy businesses could continue to access funding. Following all those announcements, markets recovered slightly during trading Tuesday, with the S&P advancing 6 percent. But Tuesday's bounce followed a historic bloodbath in the markets on Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst single-point loss in history, declining 2,999 points or 12.9 percent. Investors were clearly expecting a rough start to the week after a weekend of government announcements to rapidly expand containment measures, including through school closures as well as shuttering bars and restaurants. The Federal Reserve also cut interest rates to zero on Sunday, but that didn't avert the selloff. There are three possible market-wide circuit breakers, which regulators put in place in 2013 to ensure that declines in stocks are orderly. If the S&P 500 index drops 7 percent or 13 percent before 3:25 p.m., trading will stop for 15 minutes. After 3:25 p.m., declines in those levels don’t halt market-wide trading. But a 20 percent market decline at any time of day halts trading for the rest of the day. There were two trading pauses last week and one on Monday. Before that, the only time a market-wide break occurred was in 1997, under different thresholds and rules established by the SEC following a stock market crash in 1987.",Stock plunge triggers fourth trading pause in 2 weeks,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/stock-plunge-triggers-trading-pause-135792,politico

"President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday he is dispatching the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort to New York Harbor, while also invoking the Defense Production Act to expand the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking beside Trump in the White House, Defense Secretary Mark Esper also announced that he has alerted field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as needed to support the response. The Navy has two hospital ships. The other, USNS Mercy, is being prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast, Trump said. The ships will be launched in the next week, he said, noting that he spoke with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced the Comfort deployment in a press conference minutes before the president's comments. ""They are in tip-top shape,"" Trump said. The Navy is getting ships crewed and ready to launch, defense officials said. Mercy should be underway in days, but Comfort could take two weeks to deploy because it is still finishing up maintenance, according to chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman. Esper told reporters Tuesday that the Pentagon is preparing the ships, which are equipped with 1,000 hospital beds each, for a potential deployment to hotspots to relieve civilian hospitals dealing with the virus. Defense officials noted that the hospital ships aren't conducive to containing infectious disease outbreaks, but can be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while existing medical facilities focus on disease treatment. ""Our capabilities are focused on trauma ... they don't have necessarily the segregated spaces that you need to deal with infectious diseases,"" Esper said Tuesday, adding that deploying the hospital ships could ""take the pressure off of civilian hospitals when it comes to trauma cases to open up civilian hospital rooms for infectious diseases."" In addition to the hospital ships, the Pentagon has put on alert 1,000 ""deployable"" beds from a variety of different medical units, said Joint Staff Surgeon Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs. These temporary units are designed to deal with trauma patients, he said. Esper said Wednesday that Army Corps of Engineers officials are in New York meeting with Cuomo to go over options for additional actions. Separately, the Pentagon has opened its 16 certified coronavirus testing labs to test non-DoD personnel, will make available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves and distribute up to 2,000 deployable ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services, Esper said. Meanwhile, the Air Force on Tuesday flew 500,000 swabs used as part of testing kits from Italy to Memphis, Tenn., on a military cargo plane, officials said, confirming a report by Defense One. In Memphis, the shipment was loaded onto FedEx aircraft and distributed per HHS direction around the country, Hoffman said. The Air Force is in discussions to provide additional transport capability for test kits, and to support evacuations with cargo aircraft modified to treat infectious diseases, according to Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein. By invoking the Defense Production Act, the administration would be allowed to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of critical medical supplies. The act, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is designed ""to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs."" ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on Feb. 28.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday began to invoke the rhetoric of “a wartime president” as he told reporters he views himself as one, while his administration fights to contain the spread of coronavirus and mitigate the economic fallout from the global pandemic. “I do, I actually do, I'm looking at it that way,” Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House when asked whether he considered the U.S. to be on a wartime footing. “I look at it, I view it as, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that's what we're fighting.“ Trump has repeatedly referred to U.S. attempts to battle the virus — which has sickened thousands across the U.S. and killed more than 100 — as a “war” against an “invisible enemy.” But during Wednesday’s briefing he went the furthest yet in adopting the rhetoric of a commander in chief during wartime.  At the top of his remarks, the president pointed to the havoc the virus has begun to wreak on the economy, telling reporters in the White House briefing room that the pandemic would require a response unseen since World War II. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” he told reporters, offering examples like teenagers volunteering to fight in the war and workers sleeping on factory floors. “To this day, nobody has ever seen like it, what they were able to do during World War II,” he continued. “Now it's our time. We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together. It's the invisible enemy. That's always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy.” ""It's a very tough situation here. You have to do things,” he explained later. “You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they've ever been. And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy ... but we're doing it and we're doing it well.” The comments coincided with a number of announcements from the president on an expanded coronavirus response across the federal government centered on a mobilization of military resources at the Pentagon as the outbreak worsens. The number of confirmed cases has exploded in recent weeks, with deaths topping 100 for the first time on Tuesday night and one Washington county alone reporting 10 new deaths Wednesday afternoon.  Trump for the first time said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, and announced the deployment of military hospital ships to virus hotspots, though he later wrote in a tweet that he had only done so “should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.“ Additionally, Trump declared that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was now “fully engaged at the highest levels” and operating in every region of the country, though he didn’t elaborate. He also announced that his housing department would temporarily suspend evictions and foreclosures. The unfamiliar rhetoric from Trump came as Congress is speeding to put a second multibillion-dollar emergency aid package on his desk this week before immediately turning to a third package to prop up industries that have been gutted by the outbreak. Trump also announced a slew of other measures aimed at blunting the spread of the virus, including that his administration is looking into self-administered coronavirus tests in an effort to dramatically expand access to tests for the fast-spreading disease. Trump told reporters that his administration is working with “several groups” to determine whether a “self-swab” is as accurate as the tests health providers are currently performing. He added he's pushing for speedy FDA approval of the self-swab test that people can do themselves. He didn’t elaborate on the timeline of getting the diagnostic to market, or who’s producing it. “It would free up a lot,” Trump argued. The new process, he said, would be a “much easier process than the current process that's not very nice to do — I can tell you, because I did it. But we have a current process that's a little bit difficult, if you haven't done.” Trump announced last weekend that the White House physician had tested him for coronavirus late Friday evening. Late Saturday his top spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, issued a memo saying the president did not have the virus. On Wednesday, Trump also said that he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which would significantly increase the production of critical equipment including hospital beds and other medical supplies by allowing the administration to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of critical medical supplies. Officials have repeatedly warned of a shortage of ventilators and respirators to treat patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, as well as masks for health care providers. Administration officials couldn’t clarify how many ventilators are currently available around the country for critically sick COVID-19 patients, and Trump conceded the system was caught off-guard with the shortfall in ventilator supply — calling the situation a “very unforeseen thing.” “We have tremendous numbers of ventilators but there's never been an instance like this, where no matter what you have it’s not enough,” Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence said the government had more than 10,000 ventilators stockpiled to deploy out to hospitals, roughly echoing an estimate from over the weekend from the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had put the number at just under 13,000. The Defense Department pledged on Tuesday to send HHS about 2,000 ventilators to add to its stock — but as growing numbers of hospital report shortages, it’s unclear whether supply can keep up with mounting critical cases.  Several local and state leaders had been pleading with Trump for several days to deploy military resources to assist in fighting the disease, including asking the Army Corps of Engineers to quickly erect hospitals to house coronavirus patients. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said during Wednesday’s briefing that the Army Corps was in New York — which has become the biggest hot spot on the East Coast — meeting with leaders there, while Trump announced that the Pentagon was deploying two military hospital ships: one there and another to an undetermined location on the West Coast. Esper added that he’d put a number of field and expeditionary hospitals on notice for deployment at Trump’s request.  In addition, Trump said that the Department of Housing and Urban development, in an attempt to provide “immediate relief” for homeowners and renters, would be suspending foreclosures and evictions through the end of April. Amid the mad scramble and confusion over shortages in protective gear for front-line hospital workers, the Center on Medicare and Medicaid Services is recommending conservation as of Wednesday. In another attempt to avoid overcrowding in hospitals, Pence and CMS Administrator Seema Verma urged hospitals to delay elective procedures “across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they are needed most.” Verma urged a widespread limit on elective medical visits and surgeries — like dental visits — where clinicians need masks, but announced that more detailed rules would come later in the day, although they won’t be mandatory as some local officials have threatened. “We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients and hospitals prioritize what is essential, while leaving the ultimate decision and the heads of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients,” she said. “And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations. They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines. And it'll protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.” Front-line doctors and nurses are worried specifically about the dwindling supplies of respirator masks, which they need for intubating a critically sick COVID-19 patient to protect themselves against infection. But clinicians treating infectious diseases burn through protective gear quickly, and some doctors have already begun to get sick themselves.  The Defense Department is offering five million masks, but only one million of these are available right away. Trump acknowledged the pressing need, as hospitals continue reporting that they’re days away from running out of their supplies.  “We have targets for masks, the numbers of masks are incredible,” he said. “We've ordered millions of them. But we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested, and we've never had to even think in terms of these numbers. But we need millions of masks and all that will be ordered.” Nearly one-third of nursing homes, whose residents are among those most at risk of dying from the virus, don’t have these masks on hand, nor are they used to supplying them. Also at Wednesday’s briefing, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, sounded a new alarm about data that show young people as well as old are getting seriously ill from COVID-19, flagging concerns based on reports from Italy and France that show some cases of young people in critical hospital care.  “It may have been that the millennial generation — our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades — there may be disproportional numbers of infections among that group,” she said. Birx also sent out an urgent call for young people to stay home if their offices or schools have shuttered, and to conscientiously avoid social gatherings.  “We can't have these large gatherings that constantly do occur throughout the country for people who are off work, to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus,” she said. Photos from earlier in the week showed thousands of people flocking to Florida beaches, where the pandemic didn’t appear to stall spring break activities even as the rest of the country was shutting down. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded Tuesday by ordering a crack-down on beach crowds and warned that beachgoers would have to adhere to the CDC guidelines of social distancing. Despite looking to project a sense of control over the pandemic on Wednesday, Trump rejected challenges to his credibility and a lack of confidence in his handling of the outbreak.  When one reporter pointed to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from the day before that found 60 percent of Americans putting “not very much” or no trust in Trump to handle the crisis, the president pointed to his overall approval rating among Republicans, which has remained high. He then pivoted to a brief attack on former Vice President Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Trump also flatly denied that he’d seen an internal report from the Department of Health and Human Services predicting that the outbreak could stretch as much as 18 months, and sparred with reporters over his recent references to the virus as the “Chinese virus.” Meanwhile, stock markets dove during the White House briefing.  Just before the coronavirus task force wrapped up its briefing, the S&P 500 index hit the 7 percent decline needed to trigger a mandatory 15-minute break under SEC rules — the fourth such triggering of the so-called circuit breaker in two weeks.",Trump labels himself ‘a wartime president’ combating coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-administration-self-swab-coronavirus-tests-135590,politico
"Nearly 500 Homeland Security employees are quarantined because of the novel coronavirus, and at least 13 are confirmed or presumed COVID-19 positive, according to documentation reviewed by POLITICO.   A DHS spokesperson would not to comment on the record for this story. The department previously revealed that eight Transportation Security Administration officers had contracted COVID-19. But the latest numbers are higher and highlight the challenge the novel coronavirus poses to the federal workforce. More than 240,000 people work for DHS, making it the third-largest workforce in the federal government. Many of those employees interact with numerous people every day as part of their work, including employees with Customs and Border Protection and the TSA. “The department’s leadership is going to have to pay very close attention as this public health crisis evolves,” said John Cohen, former acting undersecretary of intelligence and analysis. “It has to be concerned that its ability to carry out its core mission could be compromised if there’s a widespread outbreak of the virus among DHS personnel. And quite frankly, that’s something that federal, state, and local officials need to be concerned about across the board — that this virus will spread among first responders, law enforcement, and Homeland Security personnel, compromising the ability of those organizations to protect the public.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised people to “put distance” between themselves and others if the virus is spreading in their community. Thousands of Americans are following this directive, and numerous workplaces have directed their employees to work from home.  The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents TSA officers, has criticized the department over its handling of the outbreak. The union pushed for them to be able to wear respirators at work, but, according to a statement from AFGE, TSA management refused, only allowing surgical masks.  A TSA spokesperson said the agency is deferring to CDC guidance that such respirators should be reserved for health care workers. The safety of the DHS workforce has also drawn attention from the Hill.  “It’s important to remember that during this pandemic, the DHS workforce is still manning the frontlines, protecting our skies and borders,” House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement. “It’s critical they are properly protected — and the Administration has a long-term plan for this. Not just for their own health and safety, but to ensure we have a fully functional frontline workforce in the months to come.” The diagnoses and quarantines come as DHS employees have faced significant strain under the Trump administration, according to David Lapan, the department’s chief spokesperson for the first nine months of Trump’s presidency.  “Because of the president’s outsized focus on the immigration enforcement part of the DHS mission set — since immigration is not the only thing in DHS’ mission — the organization has been under a lot of strain over the last three years,” he said. “The focus on immigration, lots of attention, lots of presidential pressure, vacancies, changes in leadership, the government shutdown, people having to work without pay — after all of that, add on this pandemic and I think you have cause for concern about a workforce that has been under extended stress now having to endure yet more.”",Documents show undisclosed coronavirus cases at DHS,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/undisclosed-coronavirus-cases-at-homeland-security-135569,politico
"The COVID-19 outbreak is causing massive disruption to the U.S. economy as global supply chains break down, travel is canceled and people practice “social distancing,” avoiding everything from restaurants and retail outlets to conferences and office meetings. One-fifth of U.S. workers already report losing hours or work because of the pandemic.  Worker layoffs are often seen as an inevitable part of an economic crisis like the one we’re living through. Unfortunately, job losses carry a high price for individuals and the economy—laid-off workers have less income to take care of their families, lose access to health insurance and deepen the economic crisis by spending less. And, laying off workers can even slow a recovery when employers must spend valuable time and money to rebuild their workforce as the economy improves.  But, unless a business has been forced to fully close, there’s a way to keep workers on the payroll, ease the pain of a downturn and speed economic recovery. It’s called “work-sharing.”  This is an idea that other countries have used in past downturns to far greater effect than the United States. State and federal officials should act now to ramp up this option here. Twenty-six states covering about 70 percent of the U.S. workforce already have formal programs to provide financial help to employers who embrace shared-work policies; those states need to do more to make employers aware of the option. And states that don’t yet have formal shared-work programs can and should put them in place quickly.  Here’s how work-sharing, or “short-time compensation” programs work. Employers experiencing a temporary reduction in business agree to cut employees’ hours instead of laying off workers entirely. Employees on reduced hours receive unemployment benefits in proportion to the reduction in their hours. Businesses benefit by retaining valued employees and avoiding recruitment and training costs when economic conditions return to normal. Workers benefit by retaining most of their income and access to health insurance — a critical factor in a public health-triggered economic crisis like this one.  By helping to keep people in their jobs, work-share programs mitigate unemployment. And short-time compensation benefits are well targeted, reaching exactly the people who are suffering a drop in earnings and are likely to need the money the most. In this sense, they are better targeted and more likely to provide direct economic stimulus than cutting payroll taxes or sending checks to everyone.  In short, shared-work programs are specifically designed to help businesses and workers—and their communities—get through temporary economic disruptions like those caused by COVID-19.  Business surveys show that employers using shared-compensation programs are overwhelmingly very satisfied with them. The problem is that, even in states with a short-term compensation program, most businesses don’t know about the option. During the Great Recession—a period when shared work could have been helpful to many businesses—relatively few employers operating in states with shared-work programs made use of them. In response, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included provisions to bolster use. Under the law, the federal government funded state marketing to raise employer awareness about the program and reimbursed states’ short-time compensation costs for three years.  Our research shows that even modest efforts to advertise short-time compensation programs can significantly raise employer awareness and use. In large demonstration projects done in cooperation with Oregon and Iowa, we found that low-key advertising campaigns raised employer awareness of the shared-work option by 15 to 30 percentage points. In Oregon, these efforts increased employer participation in work-share plans by 50 to 100 percent. These demonstrations were run during an economic expansion; Outreach should be even more effective during a slowdown—like the one we are currently experiencing.  What should states and the federal government do now to ensure that employers can and will implement work-sharing?  First, states with short-time compensation options should do more to get the word out to employers. Public service announcements, mailings and targeted outreach in industries where sales are especially hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak can be effective ways to quickly reach businesses that might benefit from the program. Federal subsidies could help to spur such outreach.  Second, the federal government should subsidize states’ short-time compensation programs during the COVID-19 crisis. Under existing law, employers’ unemployment insurance tax rates are tied to the past benefits paid to their workers. This means that many employers’ unemployment insurance tax rates will increase if they lay off workers or use work-share programs. Congress should pass legislation providing reimbursement to states for the costs of work-share benefits paid during the current crisis and stipulate that the tax rates of employers who set up short-time compensation plans will not go up. Some employers might choose to reduce employee hours instead of laying off people regardless, but unless they participate in a work-share program, their employees will not have access to prorated unemployment insurance benefits. Removing the tax consequences of participation in work share should increase employer use of this beneficial program that gets money to people who need it.  Third, states without a short-time compensation option should move quickly to adopt it as part of their unemployment insurance system. The current crisis—which we hope will be relatively short-lived—is a perfect example of the circumstances in which short-time compensation can be most helpful to businesses, workers and communities. It’s better for workers and for their communities if temporary downturns don’t turn into permanent job loss. Every state in the country needs this option.  Short-time compensation is a crisis-mitigation tool we already have in our arsenal to fight this pandemic’s economic fallout. Other countries already are taking steps to encourage the use of shared work during this crisis. Federal and state decision-makers need to act quickly to make it available throughout the United States. The health of our population — and our economy — may depend on it.

"Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced Wednesday the state is delaying primary runoff elections that were scheduled for later this month until July 14 because of concerns about coronavirus, delaying the GOP Senate runoff between former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville for more than three months. ""The ability to hold free and fair elections is an inherent right as citizens of the United States and the great state of Alabama, but the safety and wellbeing of Alabama citizens is paramount,"" Ivey said in a statement released by her office. Tuberville and Sessions finished in the top two spots in the March 3 primary and were set to face each other in the March 31 runoff to face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. Ivey's decision delays Republicans nominating a candidate to face Jones for more than three months. The race is Republicans' top offensive target on the Senate map this cycle and has significant implications for which party controls the Senate next year. President Donald Trump endorsed Tuberville after the former football coach earned the top spot in the primary, a blow to Sessions campaign with just weeks until the original runoff date. It's unclear how the postponement will affect the race, although it will likely force both candidates to raise significantly more funds for the intraparty election and delay the beginning of a general election campaign against Jones, who won his party's primary uncontested. Sessions said in a statement that the ""safety and health of Alabamians must take precedence."" He also took a shot at Tuberville, hinting at the implications of a longer primary election between the two candidates. “We intend to maintain our vigorous campaign up until the last day, even as we are careful to do so in a manner that puts the health and safety of the public first,"" Sessions said. ""It will be very difficult for Tommy Tuberville to hide from debates for four months. He will have to conquer his fears, and face me and the voters.” In a statement from his campaign, Tuberville said he understood the decision to delay the election. His campaign did not address Sessions' criticism. ""I understand Gov. Ivey's decision to postpone the runoff until July 14 and join her in encouraging all Alabamians to stay safe, be kind to their fellow citizens and follow all guidelines related to the Coronavirus,"" Tuberville said. ""I pray that the current health crisis will be brought under control and that lives will be saved."" Jones, in a statement, also praised the decision. He called for expanding voting access by enacting early voting and expanding vote-by-mail. Ivey, during a press conference announcing the decision to postpone the runoff, said she did not see a reason to implement no-excuse absentee voting or expanding vote-by-mail, but also encouraged voters to request absentee ballots by citing health concerns over coronavirus. The decision also postpones runoffs between Republicans running in for two open, GOP-leaning congressional seats.",Alabama Senate runoff postponed until July,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/alabama-senate-runoff-postponed-coronavirus-135557,politico

"The coronavirus pandemic has yet to land fully and already some U.S. industries are angling for federal bailouts. The airlines want $60 billion in direct assistance and loan guarantees to counter the passenger fall-off, compared with the $15 billion they received after 9/11. The casino industry has thrust out its hat, as have the cruise lines, the hospitality industry, the oil shale operators and others. While the coronavirus crisis—and all but certain recession—is real and demands emergency action, the government must resist dispensing cash aid to every imperiled industry and faction that petitions for help. No industry, no single company, no individual has an automatic moral claim on the contents of the U.S. Treasury, no matter how severely the crisis has injured their bottom lines. Nor does the federal government have the capacity to restore every industry company and individual to their prior economic standing. Today’s trickle of requests will likely turn into a stampede if the government blindly accedes to corporate requests. Already, entrenched K Street lobbyists are presenting their “asks” to the federal government, as POLITICO’s Theodoric Meyer reports. As we draw the blueprint for how best to enlist the government in rebuilding the wounded economy, let’s study the lessons taught by earlier bailouts so we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. In 2001, the federal government bailed out the airline industry with a $15 billion package. But by 2004, the program’s deficiencies were glaring. The airlines were already in trouble before 9/11, and the bailout propped up the ailing ones at the expense of the healthy ones, as the New York Times reported in a 2004 postmortem. “The bailout program may actually have made matters worse, some experts say, by forestalling a badly needed shakeout in the industry, keeping the weakest carriers alive at the expense of the others and perpetuating a glut of flights and seats,” the Times wrote. CBS News later reported that some of the bailout money went to already bankrupt companies, package delivery fleets and Grand Canyon tour helicopters. Today, and presumably for the coming months, the government is discouraging discretionary travel to beat the virus, which means we won’t need as many airline seats in the short term. The rational thing for the government to do would be to let the weaker airlines go out of business as the stronger but still viable carriers continue flying under Chapter 11 bankruptcy—as they have done in previous airline downturns. A new airline bailout would only repeat 2001’s mistake of preserving the weaker airlines at the expense of the better-run ones. The biggest Washington bailouts have traditionally gone to the largest, most politically connected industries: The railroads, the automakers, aviation, the banks. The Tuesday Washington Post explains how the cruise lines, less crucial to the economy than the railroads, automakers and banks, might soon navigate their way to the federal trough. President Donald Trump counts Carnival Corp. Chairman Micky Arison as a friend. His firm was also an advertiser on Trump’s Apprentice show. The Norwegian Cruise Line has also made friends with the Trumps. It made a $100,000 donation to his foundation in 2005 after Melania Trump christened one of its ships. (She was named the ship’s “godmother.”) Brian Ballard and Pam Bondi, two Trump loyalists, were registered lobbyists for Carnival North American last year. Meanwhile, the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising travelers against taking a cruise. What sort of sense does it make for one branch of the government to discourage cruise travel and another to encourage continued voyages with subsidies? This would be as crazy as the government subsidizing tobacco farmers at the same time it spends millions on discouraging smoking—something that it does. So I guess there’s a precedent, but it’s an insane one.  The fattest target among the bailout pleaders is the casino industry. Trump, by the way, was once a casino owner and counts among his biggest campaign donors the casino megaowner Sheldon Adelson. On Monday, the gambling lobby told the Washington Post that the $260 billion industry was at a “near standstill” and begging for funds to continue. While sympathies should go out to every showgirl, valet, bartender, maid and craps dealer on the Las Vegas strip, it’s unconscionable to use federal money to prop up an industry that serves gamblers! Gambling, like attending a movie or baseball game, is entertainment, and hardly essential to our way of life the way electricity, roadways, food and shelter are. If we’re performing economic triage, there can’t be a worse candidate for a bailout and a better candidate for Chapter 11 reorganization than the casinos. We’ve never bailed out failing entertainment companies before, and this is no time to start. Besides, if we’re going to bail out the casinos, why not bail out MLB, the NBA, the NHL, the Masters golf tournament, the Kentucky Derby and the other sports businesses that have paused their operations (but not yet asked for bailouts)? What’s next? Bailouts for shuttered nightclubs and concert halls? The Regal, Landmark and Alamo movie theaters that just closed? Where does it end? While no request for a bailout or other relief should be categorically rejected, neither should any program of temporary relief become permanent or inviolate. Every bailout and accommodation should come with some sort of sunset provision so that businesses don’t become wards of the state or dependent on government largesse. “Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program,” economist Milton Friedman once wrote. If we make mistakes with our bailouts, we should leave ourselves in a position to correct them quickly. Perhaps there are instances and industries that deserve government handouts. Writing in the Wednesday Washington Post, business columnist Steven Pearlstein makes a guarded case for issuing federally guaranteed loans to select stressed companies that come with stringent conditions: no cash gifts like the airlines and cruise lines appear to want, and terms that should be no better “than if they were seeking capital from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.” In the very short term, we should be gung-ho for subsidizing the making of ventilators, masks and essential medical supplies. There’s also much to commend Mitt Romney and Andrew Yang’s proposal to give every American $1,000 to tide them over until the complexity of the coronavirus crisis is fully understood. But we should approach bailouts and other emergency actions with trepidation and guided by the understanding that anything we bail out now is likely to leave us with one less dollar to bail out something else later.

And why? “I just read an article in Science Magazine about the worry about the spread of COVID-19 in Africa. As attention has turned to the outbreak in the U.S., it reiterated to me what many of us in global health have been thinking about -- that we must also stay focused on how the epidemic grows in low- and middle-income countries where U.S. global health programs operate. We know how outbreaks can have a ripple effect across critical health initiatives and as resources shift to urgent situations, it is near impossible to predict what the broader impact on countries could be.

This likely scenario speaks to an ongoing need for investments in health systems building blocks worldwide.” What’s a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “Maybe at this stage it isn't fair to call COVID-19 a trend that isn't getting enough attention given how the situation has evolved in recent weeks, but many of us in the global health community have been working over the years to call attention to the threat of a pandemic like this. We need to figure out how to break the cycle of experts pointing at all of the warning signs, and real attention on preparedness and response not happening until too late. If we have learned anything from past outbreaks like Zika and Ebola, it’s that there will be more to protect beyond a basic emergency response.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday insisted that he was justified in branding the coronavirus pandemic as the ""Chinese Virus,"" disregarding criticism that the label is racially offensive and inaccurately depicts the global nature of the disease's threat. ""It's not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,"" Trump told reporters at the White House coronavirus task force’s daily news briefing as he was pressed on his repeated use of the term. Earlier Wednesday, the president invoked the controversial descriptor in three morning Twitter posts, initially assuring Americans forced out of work by the burgeoning outbreak that the ""onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault!"" Trump then wrote that he would be holding a news conference to discuss an announcement from the Food and Drug Administration ""concerning the Chinese Virus"" and claimed he had ""always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,"" despite his previous comments minimizing its risk to the country.  Trump first employed ""Chinese Virus"" online Monday and again Tuesday, lamenting the industries and states that have been affected by the pandemic, which he had until then stylized as the ""CoronaVirus"" in messages on social media. He also mentioned the ""Chinese Virus"" in his opening remarks at a White House meeting with tourism industry executives on Tuesday, as well as at the outset of Wednesday's briefing. The president's decision to switch labels for the coronavirus comes after he referred to COVID-19 as a ""foreign virus"" in an Oval Office address last Wednesday, and represents another apparent attempt to deflect blame for the public health crisis. Trump last Friday charged without evidence that former President Barack Obama was responsible for the current administration's failure to test large numbers of Americans for the coronavirus, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, remarking, ""I don't take responsibility at all."" He also insisted Monday that the coronavirus is ""nobody’s fault, unless you go to the original source,"" and said Tuesday that ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic"" — an assertion that did not square with his past attempts to downplay the threat. Trump's adoption of ""Chinese Virus"" is a twist on the phrase ""Wuhan virus,"" which gained some prominence in news reporting on the outbreak and has since been echoed by White House allies and administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who note that the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, a city in China's central province of Hubei. Chinese officials have lashed out over the word choice, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang last Monday condemning ""the despicable practice of individual U.S. politicians eagerly stigmatizing China and Wuhan by association with the novel coronavirus, disrespecting science and WHO,"" according to The Washington Post. American officials in turn have accused China of spreading misinformation by hinting without evidence that the disease may have originated in the U.S.  ""I have a great love for all the people from our country, but as you know, China tried to say at one point that — maybe they've stopped now — that it was caused by American soldiers,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""That can't happen. It's not going to happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China."" Still, the president's language has been met with resistance from other administration officials. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar committed that he would no longer ascribe a nationality or region to the outbreak, saying during congressional testimony last month that ""ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus."" Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's emergency program, also emphasized Wednesday that ""viruses know no borders"" and scolded Trump for his statements regarding the ""Chinese Virus."" ""It's really important that we be careful in the language we use, lest it lead to profiling of individuals,"" Ryan said in Geneva. ""This is something we need to all avoid. I'm sure anyone would regret profiling a virus along ethnic lines.""  Democratic lawmakers have raised similar objections. ""I've said it once & I'll say it again loud enough for the @WhiteHouse, @FoxNews, & everyone else to hear: coronavirus does not discriminate. Bigotry against people of Asian descent is unacceptable, un-American, & harmful to our COVID-19 response efforts,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted Tuesday. During Wednesday's briefing, the president was asked about increased incidents of anti-Asian discrimination in the wake of the pandemic, including an account by CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that an unnamed White House official ""referred to #Coronavirus as the 'Kung-Flu' to my face.""  But Trump denied that his use of the term ""Chinese Virus"" put Asian Americans at risk. ""No, not all. I think they probably would agree with it 100 percent. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree,"" he said. Some on Capitol Hill have also defended the president's rhetoric as they admonish the authoritarian government in Beijing for its handling of the outbreak. ""I don't understand why China gets upset bc we refer to the virus that originated there [as] the 'Chinese virus,'"" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote Wednesday on Twitter. ""Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918&1919."" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said Monday on Fox News that ""anyone who complains that it's racist or xenophobic to call this virus the 'Chinese coronavirus' or the 'Wuhan virus' is a politically correct fool."" Cotton, who has floated the unsubstantiated theory that the coronavirus was manufactured by the Chinese in a bioweapons lab, also warned in an ominous statement last Thursday that the U.S. ""will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.""  Trump said Wednesday that he did not believe China was ""inflicting"" the coronavirus upon Americans, but argued that Beijing ""could have given us a lot earlier notice"" about the disease. ""I know where it came from. I don't know if you'd say China is to blame,"" the president said. ""Certainly we didn't get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier. But it comes from China. It's not a question about that. Nobody's questioning it.""",Trump on 'Chinese virus' label: 'It's not racist at all',2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-pandemic-drumbeat-coronavirus-135392,politico
"Don’t be fooled by the barren grocery store shelves: There’s plenty more food on the way. Meat, dairy and produce groups as well as federal regulators say the U.S. has an ample amount of products in cold storage to handle the unexpected demand for food and household products from Americans. The latest Agriculture Department data shows record-high stocks of frozen poultry, cheeses like American and Swiss and red raspberries, while frozen pork supplies are up 11 percent from last year. Rice producers, whose grains have been flying off of store shelves along with other inexpensive and long-lasting foods, say there’s no shortage and those items are being “quickly replenished.” “If you see depleted rice shelves in your local grocery store, it is not a supply problem; it is a signifier of changing logistics in the retail market,” said USA Rice President Betsy Ward in a statement. On Tuesday, federal meat inspection agencies said they continue to operate as normal. Food imports continued to flow across the Southern border despite restrictions on nonessential travel. And the Trump administration and grocery executives stressed that the supply chain is holding firm, even if consumers see long lines at stores across the country. Top retail chains like Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B have reduced store hours to give workers more time to restock high-demand products overnight, and agriculture groups insist there’s no threat of food shortages. Amazon, the largest online retailer, announced it would hire an additional 100,00 workers in its U.S. warehouses to help handle increased demand for household staples, including groceries, while temporarily halting intake of nonessential goods at distribution centers through April 5. Meanwhile, the White House and Congress are on the verge of what could be a $1 trillion stimulus package for workers and industries like airlines and small businesses. It will likely include at least $1 billion in extra food assistance, which could see more demand as restaurant workers, service employees and other Americans are laid off or forced to stay home for an indefinite amount of time. The food industry, for its part, is urging consumers to remain calm and avoid hoarding, suggesting that fears of shortages are overblown. “This is a demand issue, not a supply issue,” said Heather Garlich, vice president of media and public relations at FMI, the food industry association formerly known as the Food Marketing Institute. “The supply chain isn’t broken. The warehouses are pushing out as much inventory as possible in a 24-hour period.” Meat supplies have not been disrupted as processing plants continue to operate, according to USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service and groups representing major meat firms like Smithfield Foods and Cargill. FSIS is required by law to be present at more than 6,200 plants across the country. It employs about 7,800 inspectors to ensure the safety of meat, poultry and processed eggs. Without federal inspectors, plants can’t process the more than 330 billion pounds of beef, chicken, pork, lamb and turkey produced annually. Planning for absenteeism is a regular part of its food safety operations and the department is closely tracking the status of employees who are sick or out for other reasons, USDA said in a statement on Tuesday. Mindy Brashears, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for food safety, assured the agriculture industry that the department is protecting the health and safety of employees while still delivering services to keep the food supply moving. “Field personnel will be working closely with establishment management and state and local health authorities to handle situations as they arise in your community,” Brashears said in a letter. “As always, communication between industry and government will be key. We are all relying on early and frequent communication with one another to overcome challenges as they arise."" Sarah Little, spokesperson for the North American Meat Institute, said if plants are closed because of staffing shortages other facilities will likely pick up some of that capacity. “It is impossible to predict, however, the scenarios for individual plants across the nation,” she said. “Many companies are operating normally but they have contingency plans to address the threat of coronavirus.” At the retail level, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told CNBC that grocery stores are “getting deliveries every day,” including household goods like toilet paper, though he acknowledged there’s a shortage of hand sanitizers with “very little coming in."" McMullen spoke to President Donald Trump on Sunday along with other top grocers and food manufacturers, and he said he urged the president to spread the message to consumers that “there’s plenty of food in the supply chain.” Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain, is also considering giving seniors and shoppers with medical conditions exclusive access to stores for an hour in the morning, allowing them to avoid crowds later in the day. “We’re starting to test it in a few markets in the next couple of days to see how it works,” McMullen said. “If it works well, we’ll expand it to other markets as well.” Laura Strange, a spokesperson for the National Grocers Association, which represents independent grocery stores, said the group’s members are hiring cashiers and staffing up for round-the-clock restocking. “It’s really an all-hands-on-deck situation where everyone is lending a helping hand where they can,” including CEOs stocking shelves and manning cash registers, Strange said. Anthony Hucker, CEO of Southeastern Grocers, whose brands include Winn-Dixie, told CNBC in a separate interview that his stores have seen demand for certain items spike as much as 200 percent, but they’re well versed in handling those surges. Hucker said they’ve “built a very strong muscle, especially around our computer-generated ordering systems,” after dealing with catastrophic hurricanes in recent years. He said fresh foods like produce, seafood and deli products sourced from local suppliers are readily available to shoppers. The U.S. imports nearly half of its fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico. Of the $26 billion worth of agricultural goods shipped across the southern border each year, more than $13 billion is produce. As of Tuesday, fresh produce continued to flow across the Arizona border without any hiccups, said Jaime Chamberlain, president of a distributing company in Nogales, Ariz., that sources peppers, squash, tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables from 14 growers in Mexico. Chamberlain is also board chairman of the Greater Nogales and Santa Cruz County Port Authority, through which about $3.5 billion worth of food and 360,000 trucks pass annually, he said. “So far there are no disruptions,” Chamberlain said. “We’re in the middle of our produce season. It’s typical. Things are in short supply because of the enormous demand and some weather issues this spring, but our growing season is the same.” Chamberlain said his business has experienced a drop in sales to restaurant and food service sectors like hotels and cruise lines, but grocery retailers have made up for those losses. He added that he expects international trade will continue, even if Trump bans travel between the U.S. and Mexico, similar to the current restrictions on the EU. However, heightened travel restrictions for passengers can also weigh on imports of fresh foods like berries flown in from other continents, according to Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition. “Much of the capacity for air cargo is at the bottom of passenger flights,” he said. “Now, because there’s no passengers on the top of the plane, a lot of those airlines are just not flying those planes, and therefore we’ve lost a lot of capacity to bring air cargo into the U.S.” Friedmann said the “severe backup in the global supply chain” emanating from China — which shut down factories and ports earlier this year, causing trans-Pacific shipments to plummet — has also led to logjams throughout the U.S. He also called on federal transport regulators to loosen trucking rules for food and farm goods amid the crisis, like they did for medical devices and other items needed to address the outbreak. “We need to have that same [flexibility] for agriculture, for food, because it will reduce congestion,” Friedmann said. “We’ll be able to more dependably supply supermarkets and other places where the product needs to go.” One potential threat to the food supply is the temporary shutdown of U.S. embassies and consulates in Mexico, effective Wednesday, which help process visas for seasonal farm workers, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The U.S. agriculture industry has already been dealing with chronic labor shortages for at least a decade, and without comprehensive immigration reform, has increasingly relied on the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program. Applications for H-2A visas jumped by nearly 11 percent in fiscal 2019 over the previous year. The visas are to fill more than 257,000 jobs in states like Florida and California where much of America’s produce is harvested, according to Labor Department data. “The decision to halt visa application processing in Mexico will restrict the number of immigrant workers being allowed to enter the country,” Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall said in a statement Tuesday. “Under the new restrictions, American farmers will not have access to all of the skilled immigrant labor needed at a critical time in the planting season. This threatens our ability to put food on Americans’ tables.” Duvall said he has urged the Trump administration to find “practical ways” to admit farm laborers under emergency visas while still protecting public health. Immigrant laborers with previous work experience in the U.S. and who do not require in-person interviews will be allowed to return in the H-2A program. Friedmann, of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, suggested it could take months to unwind the knots in the food and agricultural network, but cargo can be rerouted and other changes can be made. “The agriculture supply chain is like water. It will find the path of least resistance,” he said.",No need to hoard: There’s plenty of food in the system,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/food-supply-coronavirus-135481,politico
"Will a president with authoritarian tendencies actually try to suspend a constitutionally mandated presidential election? That’s the question Americans asked in the spring and summer of 1970. At the end of the 1960s, a wave of violence—domestic terrorism, urban riots, assassinations and rising crime—set the public on edge. A presidential panel, decrying a national “crisis of violence,” found that 41,000 bombings or bomb threats had occurred in the U.S. in the preceding 15 months. Richard Nixon—whose abuses of presidential power would ultimately lead to his resignation—struck his critics as so heedless of democratic norms and the rules of fair play that he was capable of attempting almost anything. Today, people are starting to ask the same questions. The fiasco over Ohio’s scheduled Democratic primary—with the governor and a judge waging an eleventh-hour war over whether it should proceed—and other states’ postponement of their primaries could well be a preview of a looming constitutional donnybrook over November’s vote. If the coronavirus is still largely unchecked this fall, the crowds necessitated by a presidential election would pose a huge threat to public health. Worst of all, because President Donald Trump has repeatedly shown contempt for the rule of law and the spirit of democracy, it’s not unreasonable to worry that he could try to use the pandemic as a pretext to cancel the election and remain in power. Unless Congress acts quickly to provide for nationwide early, absentee and mail-in voting this fall, these fears will surely multiply. The story of Nixon and the canceled-election rumor of 1970 shows why. That year, political violence, combined with the age-old suspicion that Nixon’s regard for the Constitution was less than sincere, spawned a rumor that he was planning to cancel the 1972 elections. Rumors are by nature hard to trace, but by one account, this one originated with the countercultural journalist and provocateur Paul Krassner. As early as 1969, Krassner began telling college audiences that, while stoned on LSD at a party, he’d been told by the wife of an executive at the Rand Corporation, the defense-industry think tank, that the Nixon administration had ordered a study of the consequences of canceling the elections. After circulating among students for many months, the rumor seems first to have landed in print on April 5, in the chain of newspapers owned by the Newhouse family: the Staten Island Advance, the Oregonian and others. According to the squib that ran in these papers, the administration had tasked Rand with studying whether “rebellious factions using force or bomb threats would make it unsafe to conduct an election,” as well as how the president should respond. The journalist Ron Rosenbaum, then a young reporter for the Village Voice, heard about the Newhouse article indirectly, from a Staten Island cab driver who had seen it in the Advance. Rosenbaum looked into it. Eleven days later, he reported in the Voice that Rand and the administration both denied that any such study existed. But he then mischievously pointed out that they would surely deny it if it were true. Rosenbaum added that the country would just have to wait until 1972 to see. Whether or not Rosenbaum’s cheeky tone encouraged the rumors, or simply failed to quash them, other publications were soon running with the story—from the alternative Los Angeles Free Press to the Nation. Most treated the tale with due skepticism, but some of the more marginal publications presented the study as established fact. The rumor spread fast, assuming sinister connotations. One group called the Urban Coalition claimed that Nixon had commissioned not only the Rand study but also a second study, from MIT, to survey how voters would react to an announcement of suspended elections. Another version of the rumor held that Nixon, to ensure he had pretext for the move, was arranging for provocateurs to instigate acts of violence, to create his own version of the infamous 1933 Reichstag fire, which many people believed to have been a Nazi act designed to justify a power grab (what today might be called a “false flag” operation). “The burning of government buildings in Germany, though first blamed on Communist arson, has since been exposed as the act of Hitler himself,” comedian and activist Dick Gregory wrote (not quite accurately) in the Freedom News, an underground publication. Nixon, he intimated, was about to do the same. Nixon administration officials realized the rumor was gaining strength. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then serving as a White House domestic policy aide, tried to squelch the talk in a Fordham University commencement address he gave that spring. In his speech, he said that he knew the story had reached “just about every campus in the nation” and, ever the sociologist, chalked up its currency to students’ “growing distrust of all social institutions.” Moynihan reassured his audience that the report was “not so.” But then—either playing for a laugh or falling victim himself to the pervasive mistrust—he added: “Or at least I think that it is not so.” Like Rosenbaum, Moynihan couldn’t summon enough confidence in Nixon to deny the rumor categorically. At some level, he had to concede that the Nixon-hating conspiracy theorists might well be on to something. His remarks, too, failed to put the concerns to rest. In July, a new left-wing, countercultural magazine called Scanlan’s Monthly—run by Warren Hinckle, formerly of Ramparts, and Sidney Zion, formerly of the New York Times—joined the fracas. Scanlan’s claimed to have obtained one page of a memo allegedly written by an aide to Vice President Spiro Agnew. The memo, which Scanlan’s published in its August issue, was dated March 11, 1970, and referred to three possible schemes being planned by the administration. The first was to cancel the 1972 elections under the ostensible threat of violence, but in reality to keep the administration in power. The second was to secretly orchestrate pro-administration rallies by labor groups that would purport to be spontaneous. By the time Scanlan’s shared the contents of this supposed memo, Americans knew that the administration had in fact collaborated with labor groups to stage anti-anti-war events in the spring. That knowledge seemed to give the whole memo a whiff of plausibility. The final item in the allegedly official memo was that Nixon would eventually “repeal” the Bill of Rights. Scanlan’s advertised its “scoop” heavily. At one point, a New York Times reporter asked Agnew about the memo. The vice president erupted in anger, denouncing it as “completely false” and thereby ensuring his reaction would be covered in the paper. But Zion—whether truly convinced of the memo’s authenticity or, more likely, eager to perpetuate a hoax that was winning attention for his fledgling magazine—did not back down. “The document came directly from Mr. Agnew’s office, and he knows it. We do not hesitate to submit our credibility against his,” he said. A week later, Attorney General John Mitchell also denied and denounced the story at a breakfast meeting with reporters, possibly giving it even more oxygen. Nixon personally became so incensed about the rumor, according to White House aide John Dean, that he ordered an audit of the magazine—though as a brand new publication, it turned out, it had yet to file taxes. It’s doubtful that many people expected Nixon to suspend the election, let alone repeal the Bill of Rights. The journalists who inspected the alleged Agnew memo mostly judged it a hoax. But its authenticity mattered less than the fact that so many people considered it plausible that Nixon might entertain a power grab at all. The Nation, while stopping short of accepting the rumor, grouped it with such recent “internal security” measures as stepped-up wiretapping and infiltration. Calling Nixon “an old-time Red-hunter,” the editors argued that he was “inclined by temperament in that direction himself.” Ron Rosenbaum, in a follow-up to the pieces he wrote the previous spring, maintained that “the Rand rumor is metaphorically and cosmically true, even if proven mundanely false.” During the Nixon era, he argued, entertaining paranoid fantasies made a certain amount of sense. It is very unlikely that Trump could get away with postponing the November elections; who knows if he even wants to try. But as the Nixon example shows, that doesn’t mean we won’t all be talking about this as a live possibility as our crisis worsens. Presidents who make a show of flouting norms and arrogating power shouldn’t be surprised when large portions of the population assumes that when the crunch comes, they’ll do more of the same.",Could Trump Try to Cancel the 2020 Election?,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/could-trump-try-to-cancel-the-2020-election-134349,politico
"Washington is mobilizing to rescue the country from potentially disastrous economic consequences from the global coronavirus outbreak, with the Senate on Wednesday passing a multi-billion dollar emergency package and quickly getting to work on a larger stimulus agreement. With Senate leaders vowing to work at “warp speed” to blunt the financial fallout from the pandemic, the Treasury Department unveiled to lawmakers a plan for $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6.  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans were inching closer on Wednesday to unveiling their proposal for a third, even larger stimulus package to address the epidemic, which is likely to include some of Treasury's ideas. The Senate’s approval Wednesday of the House-passed coronavirus bill, known as “phase two,” comes as Republican senators are expected to begin negotiations with Democrats on a trillion-dollar “phase three” stimulus package as early as Wednesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell backed the House bill, which grants paid sick leave to hourly employees and expands unemployment insurance. “It is a well-intentioned bipartisan product assembled by House Democrats and President Trump’s team that tries to stand up and expand some new relief measures for American workers,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said of the House bill, which House lawmakers passed early Saturday and later approved technical corrections on Monday. Despite “real shortcomings” in the legislation, McConnell said, “in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.” Earlier Wednesday, the White House sent a proposal to the Senate with a list of potential policy options discussed at a meeting the previous day, a senior administration official said. According to the Treasury Department’s proposal, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, the so-called “phase three” proposal would include $50 billion to aid the hard-hit airline industry, $150 billion for other distressed sectors of the economy, two rounds of direct payments of $250 billion each on April 6 and May 18, and the creation of a small business interruption loan program. The document notably does not mention a payroll tax cut, which President Donald Trump has suggested he wanted to be included in the package. But the idea lost steam in recent days as lawmakers from both parties rejected the idea, citing the need to grant immediate, large-scale relief. “There are a lot of steps along the way here, but I think everybody has the motivation to get to a solution as quickly as possible,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said. “There are lots of wheels in motion — hopefully driving in the right direction.” As the coronavirus spreads across the country and the stock market continues to plunge, there is widespread recognition that the Senate needs to act swiftly and assist individuals as well as small businesses as part of the massive aid package expected to be unveiled in the coming days. McConnell has been adamant that the Senate will not leave Washington until it passes the “phase three” package. McConnell created three so-called “task forces” to come up with specific proposals to assist small businesses as they deal with the plummeting demand that comes with the lockdown orders in several cities across the country. At Senate Republicans’ lunch meeting on Wednesday, members of each task force presented the proposals they are working on, according to an attendee. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) discussed direct payments to Americans, which could potentially include an income cap. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) talked about his small business proposal and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) discussed the deferment of student loans — potentially for up to three months, the attendee said. In a sign of the personal precautions members are taking against the coronavirus, McConnell urged his colleagues to avoid congregating on the Senate floor and to leave the chamber as soon as each of them voted on Wednesday. While no lawmaker reportedly has contracted the virus, several senators have self-quarantined after possible exposure. At least one Senate staffer has tested positive for the coronavirus. And senators are continuing to urge Trump to take drastic actions usually only taken during wartime. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on the president to invoke the Defense Production Act, which could significantly increase the production of critical equipment, including hospital beds and other medical supplies. Trump later announced he was doing just that. “If you ignore the public health crisis with the equipment and infrastructure and personnel that is needed in many more numbers than we’ve ever seen, the economy won’t get better,” said Schumer, who spoke by phone with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the ""phase three"" package, according to a spokesman. During a meeting with Republican senators on Tuesday, Mnuchin warned that the unemployment rate could spike to double digits if Congress doesn't take action, according to a source familiar with the remarks. House Democrats are also drafting a third stimulus bill to act as a counter-offer to the ""phase three"" package senators are currently drafting.  Democratic lawmakers and aides say the House plan could include expanded Medicaid coverage, additional unemployment insurance payments, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, an airline rescue package and additional food security measures.  Democrats familiar with the proposal said the plan won't be completed until next week, and it remains unclear if Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring the House back to Washington to vote.  In the meantime, some Senate Democrats are already laying out their demands for the stimulus package. They’re warning that Congress’ third phase of aid must include a far more broad paid sick leave policy, or it will not clear the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to pass. “In the next package, all of us are insisting that this provision on paid sick leave and family leave be part of it,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash) said on a conference call with reporters. “It’s a non-starter if it’s not included in the next package,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), another long-time proponent of paid sick leave. “That next tranche of investment in the economy is going to require 60 votes. If it's not included, I don't believe Democratic support will be for the measure.”  Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle and Nancy Cook contributed to this report.

"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  George echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"A plunging stock market. Restaurants, gyms and movie theaters shutting their doors. Workers losing more income each day. It’s an unprecedented public crisis, and it’s also billions of dollars in state tax revenue that’s evaporating quickly — and scrambling the economic equation for governors and mayors across the nation. The cascading impacts of the novel coronavirus come just as governors, state lawmakers, mayors and city councils would normally be hammering out their budget plans for the coming year. But with no telling how long the coronavirus pandemic will shut down everyday life, a crystal ball may prove as effective as economic formulas for the fiscal year ahead. Governors of both parties are now calling on President Donald Trump and Congress to step in with billions in federal aid and reductions in red tape. They'd also be wise to dust off their playbooks from more than a decade ago when the Great Recession last caused revenues to nose-dive with little notice. Starting in the fall of 2008, California wrote and rewrote its budget three times in less than a year because projections quickly went into the dustbin within months of printing a new spending plan. Leaders in states across the nation are bracing for a similar year of drafting their documents in pencil, knowing that the situation will be hard to pin down until the world emerges from hibernation. Unlike the federal government, states and cities must balance their budgets each year. Some states, like California, may be better prepared to weather the storm, sitting on a surplus and $20 billion reserve fund built after lessons learned from the previous downturn. But others will have to figure out which programs to cut for the first time in years. Illinois, for instance, doesn’t even have a rainy day fund. That was on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s wish list for this year’s legislative session — which has now been put on hold. States such as New York are already talking about building contingencies into their spending plan. Trigger cuts — a well-worn tool during the last recession — are already entering the conversation. Washington, of course, can use its borrowing powers where states can't, as it did during the 2008-09 recession with a massive public works package intended to create jobs and buoy local economies. Congress and the Trump administration are now discussing a package of more than $1 trillion in stimulus, and state and local leaders have begun to press for emergency federal aid to support sectors from transportation to dining. “We’re going to need the federal government with us in a big way,” said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who expects states will ultimately need collective federal aid of $3 trillion to $4 trillion. “And I think everybody recognizes that — and I don’t mean just New Jersey. We’re going to need help. This is beyond any one state.” But Democrats in particular wonder if the Trump administration will be eager to increase funding to areas it previously slated for cuts, such as Medicaid and social service programs that would serve as a safety net for those hit hardest by coronavirus economic damage. POLITICO’s reporters in state capitals and major cities throughout the country are watching the budget and economic impact of the pandemic closely — here’s a look at what’s happening in several major states. Florida’s leaders are used to planning their budgets around hurricane-induced disasters and even oil spills. Coronavirus is different: Economists in the Republican-led Sunshine State say it’s difficult to forecast how hard the virus will hit the state’s tourism-dependent economy — the fourth biggest in the country — with theme parks and beaches now shuttered. The pandemic played a big-money role as the Legislature wrapped up its two-month legislative session last weekend — lawmakers scaled back planned tax cuts and boosted the state’s $3.9 billion cash reserves by $300 million to prepare for the coronavirus response. The state has set aside $50 million for bridge loans, and laid-off employees can apply for unemployment assistance. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who came to power as a close Trump ally, delivered a rebuke to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on March 17 after the secretary said the federal stimulus package should include rules to keep money from going to millionaires who don’t need it. DeSantis said federal red tape could delay aid for months. An early version of a House stimulus bill now scheduled to go before the Senate sought to distribute funds through the Social Security Administration. DeSantis said he told has told Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that the first federal stimulus bill should be packed with assistance for people who will be left jobless. It also should include more bridge loan money for small businesses facing closure, he said. The full picture of the coronavirus impact in Florida might not come into focus for some time. Lawmakers decided on $300 million in added reserves before Walt Disney Co. and NBCUniversal closed theme parks in Orlando and cities including Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach closed beaches that were packed with spring break revelers. (For context, $3 billion of the state’s forecasted $36.5 billion in general revenue this year was expected to come from tourism sales tax revenue.) Gov. Gavin Newsom insists his state is better prepared than most to deal with a downturn. California is working with a $222.2 billion budget and a record surplus and reserves. But the nation’s most populous state, which has the fifth largest economy in the world, is heavily dependent on tax revenue from wealthy earners and hence capital gains — making it particularly vulnerable to stock market swings. So expect a wild ride. Last week, the UCLA Anderson Forecast lowered its expectations for GDP growth and trade but stopped short of predicting a recession. By Monday, UCLA economists had changed their minds. Monday’s revised report said the U.S. economy has entered a recession expected to last until September, and that California will suffer more than most. California is expected to lose more than 280,000 payroll jobs by the first quarter of 2021, with more than a third of those in the leisure, hospitality, transportation and warehousing sectors, according to the report. State Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek, an influential voice on the state budget, said that “while the impact on state revenues is not yet clear, the extreme market volatility and rapidly weakening economic situation obviously have negative implications.” He issued a memo Wednesday projecting ""several billion dollars"" less in capital gains through mid-2021 and said the state would likely have to delay budget passage beyond its June 15 deadline. Still, Petek pointed to California's robust reserve fund as a buffer against potential budget cuts. Christopher Thornberg, founder of Beacon Economics in Los Angeles, is taking an optimistic approach. While this is unprecedented at a national level, he said, regions have bounced back from such natural disasters fairly quickly. It’s not necessarily like the 2008 financial crisis, which had a long-term impact on the economy and permanent loss of jobs, he said. “It’s business delayed, not business canceled. It’s spending delayed, not spending canceled,” Thornberg said. “If we’re looking at four weeks, it’s a hurricane. But to be clear, if this goes 40 weeks, California is not in a good position. … Our revenue system in the state is so hypersensitive to shifts in capital gains that if the stock market really did stay down where it is right now, we’re going to take a massive hit.” New York’s economy faces a massive hit: In a best-case scenario, tax revenues will likely be $4 billion lower than projected for the coming fiscal year, the state comptroller says, and New York City alone faces at least a $3.2 billion hit to its bottom line as travel dwindles and restaurants, bars and theaters close indefinitely, a steep loss in tax revenue that will extend for six months. Financing the massive coronavirus response, meanwhile, is going to upend Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s previously planned efforts to fill a major Medicaid budget hole. State leaders are scrambling to finish their state budget this week, but Cuomo said the original forecast is practically moot now with an expected economic downturn in weeks and months to come. The state was already staring down a roughly $6 billion budget gap, primarily due to a $4 billion Medicaid shortfall. Cuomo’s plan to address that relied on limiting the amount of local spending on Medicaid that is picked up by the state. But the second federal coronavirus bill — which would give the state billions of dollars — would make that strategy ""impossible,"" the governor complained over the weekend, because it contains language prohibiting any changes to localities' reimbursement rates. Sources close to the legislation say Cuomo is working with the New York delegation for language in additional federal coronavirus bills to allow him flexibility to move forward with his Medicaid savings plan. The state’s comptroller, Tom DiNapoli, has long suggested New York's reserves are not built up to withstand disaster or severe economic downturn. The budget Cuomo proposed would get the two largest statutory reserve funds to under $2.5 billion, about 3.1 percent of General Fund expenditures, and far below other large states such as California, Texas and Michigan. In the City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom since taking office in 2014; he’s expanded the city budget from $75 billion six years ago to a proposed $95.3 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. That streak has now ended this month, with a city economy dependent on tourism and entertainment grinding to a halt. As bad as the picture is now for the city, it still has room to get worse. De Blasio and Cuomo are looking at plans to potentially shut down roads, bridges, tunnels and trains to halt travel in and out of the city. That would drain city coffers further and could have ripple effects for national and global markets. Texas is used to booms and busts in the oil and gas sector blowing a hole in the state’s $110 billion annual budget. It’s got a rainy day fund that has more than $11 billion. “The ups and downs are nothing new for us,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park, which has a Shell manufacturing site. “It’s a normal part of the budgeting process. I’m not overly concerned.” But the oil and gas downturn is coming at the same time as the outbreak — meaning that state budget writers will have to make some tough decisions when they gather in Austin for the next session in January. An oil production tax provides 6.1 percent of the state’s revenue and natural gas production tax generates 2.7 percent. That, combined with an expected plunge in sales tax from shuttered restaurants, hotels and businesses and a lack of income tax, means Texas will have a tough time cushioning the blow. Typically, state budget writers have blunted oil price busts by drastically cutting services like education. But the state, which has the highest uninsured rate in the country, is lagging in its response to the outbreak, meaning that the virus spread could stretch thin hospitals and other services. Lawmakers will have to figure out where to get the money to help hospitals and providers while boosting health services. If Democrats take the majority in the state House this year, they will insist on not balancing the budget on the backs of low-income residents. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said that he expects the federal government to throw the state a financial lifeline — as it did after Hurricane Harvey. Illinois is particularly vulnerable budgetwise. Not only does it not have a rainy day fund, but the state a few years ago also passed a constitutional amendment that restricts the use of motor fuel fees and taxes to road construction and repair only. So Illinois has much less flexibility than other states in funneling money to a fund to respond to the impacts of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, which is grappling with a $30 billion unfunded pension debt, relies on tax revenues from conventions, tourism and hotel and restaurant activities. The city has already lost at least 20 conventions, with a combined 200,000 visitors, as a result of the 30-day ban on gatherings of 1,000 or more. (The governor has since put the ban at no more than 50 people.) “This is putting a severe dent in those industries. With Chicago being the economic engine of the state of Illinois, putting that engine in neutral while we’re navigating the social isolation necessary to combat the coronavirus puts state and local finances in a very precarious position,” said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government watchdog that is often called to testify and provide independent opinions about state and city finances. Msall said the situation is reminiscent of the economic impacts of the attacks of 9/11. “The difference is in 9/11, we knew we needed to secure against additional attacks and rebuild. Here, we don’t know when the virus will stop attacking or when it will be effectively limited — and when people can socialize again and when businesses can conduct normal operations, when entertainment, colleges, universities and schools can reopen.” In New Jersey, the economic fallout could quickly eat through the state’s $1.5 billion projected surplus, which amounts to just 3.8 percent of the state’s current $39.9 billion budget. The revenue estimates used to project the surplus made no assumptions about any economic downturn, let alone the coronavirus, and state officials don’t immediately plan to announce an updated forecast. Murphy, who has fought with fellow Democrats in the Legislature over his proposal to raise taxes on millionaires, suggested that some sort of revenue raise could be needed. Still, he said, the damage could be far more than New Jersey could handle on its own. Extending the state’s top tax rate to those earning from $1 million to $5 million would raise less than $500 million a year, based on those now-outdated projections. Murphy is working with the state's congressional delegation to lobby for federal aid in the form of block grants. In the short term, the Wall Street selloff could temper income tax losses when tax season rolls around in 2021, but a drop in dividends and, more importantly, mass layoffs are sure to suck hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars out of the state’s coffers. The state collects sales tax on all online sales, potentially stabilizing that major revenue source. State Senate President Steve Sweeney proposed on Saturday a two-month holiday from the state sales and payroll taxes and deferral of other taxes, including property taxes — a potential short-term hit to local governments. Murphy said the state may not be able to afford it. The Boston marathon may be postponed, but Massachusetts lawmakers maneuvered around questions of how coronavirus will impact the state budget early this week, calling the situation ""fluid."" Officials said instead they are focused on legislation to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, and closed the State House to visitors other than elected officials and staffers. Massachusetts hammers out its budget details over the course of the spring, but the state is used to having its budget come late into the summer.

"A president who shaped his first three years in office trying to sell Americans on obscure corporate tax provisions, minute details of tariffs and the rollback of mind-numbing regulations has a new approach: Keep it simple. Facing the most sudden economic crisis to hit any modern American leader, President Donald Trump is now pushing to send Americans four-figure checks, establish broad corporate bailout programs and lend billions of dollars to small businesses so they can keep paying their bills. The crisis approach jettisons long-held Republican philosophies about using the tax code — and the tax code alone — to reward businesses and individuals for certain types of economic behavior.  It’s a sharp reversal for a GOP that just weeks ago was railing against socialism. The new raft of proposals adopts philosophies popularized by a field of Democratic presidential candidates, like showering the public with government money and imposing strict conditions on corporate welfare.  “Both the White House and the Democrats tend to believe that helping workers affected by the shutdown with direct cash payments is the best and is the right strategy,” said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. “Now, not every Republican likes that idea. Some do.” Top officials hope these moves will help rehabilitate Trump as he comes under assault for his faltering approach to the novel coronavirus over the past two months — with troubles continuing to this date. The U.S. still does not have enough testing kits to know the full range of Americans potentially infected by the coronavirus. The pandemic has spread to all 50 states, and the lack of confidence in the administration’s efforts, combined with the shutdown of businesses, schools and restaurants, has triggered steep declines in the stock market — which Trump has always viewed as a key form of polling for his presidency. The administration’s goal this week includes pushing through Congress another economic stimulus package that is likely to top $1.3 trillion, the centerpiece of which will be checks sent directly to thousands of Americans. In recent days, President Donald Trump has latched onto the idea of the checks as a way to quickly give Americans money to cover housing payments, food and expenses as much of America’s social and business life shuts down as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.  Behind the scenes, the Treasury Department is working on the mechanics of giving Americans direct checks, with the amount depending on one’s income and family size. The administration has considered sending anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per check and has proposed Congress spend a total of $500 billion on the measure, with the IRS issuing the first of two rounds of payments starting April 6, according to the Treasury proposal obtained by POLITICO. “We are looking at different numbers. We are looking at timing that would be different,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. “Splitting the time, splitting the payments. We are looking at a lot of different things. It hasn't been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined. But people want to go big. Everybody seems to want to go big.” The direct payments have received a much better reception on Capitol Hill than the president’s earlier proposal to cut or suspend the payroll tax, a move that would have helped both employees and employers.  One senior administration official said top economic aides presented the president with a list of possible options this week to help Americans financially, and he liked the check idea because it’s an easily understood concept and the money goes out quickly, a second senior administration official said. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also outlined the check proposal earlier this week and then spoke with Trump about it on Wednesday, a person familiar with the conversation said.  Other Republican lawmakers seem equally amenable to it. “It’s a novel idea, and if it will help a lot of people help the economy because we’re in challenging times right now,” said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), one of the lawmakers involved in brainstorming ways to financially help out airlines as part of the broad rescue package. “It’s a lot of money, but the idea is to put cash in people’s hands [to] mitigate the economic effects.” I want to see who is going to receive the money. Is it everyone? Is it someone who is laid off? Is it someone who is quarantined? I just need to see the final details,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. “That’s more of a demand-side remedy. I think to solve this problem we're going to need both demand and supply.“ Senior administration officials caution the idea of a payroll tax cut could still reappear in the coming weeks, with one official noting it still remains under consideration within the administration. Trump’s top economic aides are also weighing which industries will receive government help in the form of loans. The Treasury proposal earmarked $150 billion for industries slammed by the coronavirus downturn, money that would fund loans or loan guarantees.  An additional $50 billion in loans would support the airlines. The Trump administration supports limits on raising executive compensation and reducing service, but Democrats are pushing for stricter provisions.  But the Treasury proposal does not specify which industries could access that $150 billion pool of money. That uncertainty has set off a fierce lobbying effort among hotels, cruise ships, the tourism industry and retailers, all of whom have been in close touch with the White House about the sudden and sharp declines in their businesses. The lobbying is intense because the Senate wants to negotiate this third coronavirus rescue package by the end of the week — putting one of the largest stimulus packages in modern history on an incredibly tight time frame.",Trump adopts the greatest hits of the 2020 Dems,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-economy-coronavirus-democrats-136462,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country, or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack, but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he issued a national emergency declaration to help combat the global pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president,” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the deadly outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command-and-control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy ships with operating rooms and hospital beds to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist local medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to reposition the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a “green light” for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been internal disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the current economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely since the Comfort is currently undergoing maintenance that could take weeks to complete. (The Mercy, which is currently stationed in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with local police units to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated national guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to try to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date, and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, personal friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is specifically trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Ultimately, Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing that “there is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said “tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak…,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the deadly respiratory syndrome. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the Speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander-in-chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump’s machine quickly transforms for ‘a wartime president’ ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"Government officials promise that the closing of the U.S.-Canada border to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus won’t affect trade between the two partners, but a slowdown may be inevitable as the two countries work out what business purposes should be deemed “essential.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that deliveries of food, fuel and medicines would continue under the agreement. But for a binational relationship with tight cultural and commercial ties, many specifics remained unanswered. “They’ve focused on supply chains, which is good, they’ve focused on the crew of an airplane, the driver of a truck … but what they need to focus on and what we need more guidance on right away is essential commercial travel,” said Maryscott Greenwood, a former diplomat who now heads the Canadian-American Business Council. “What is that, who qualifies, how will you decide and, if there is a disagreement, how do you resolve it?” Greenwood said one example is specialized utility company employees from Canada who may need to cross to work on plants or equipment in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is still working out the details with Canadian counterparts Wednesday after both countries’ leaders announced the contours of the deal. Greenwood warned that an “ad hoc” system “would create chaos at the border.” “It would be counterproductive and counterintuitive and an incredibly bad idea to restrict essential commercial travel in a way that harms the economy,” she said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Wednesday evening that it will close its enrollment centers for Trusted Traveler programs beginning Thursday until ""at least"" May 1 to limit employees' and the public's exposure to the virus. That could make it more difficult for any worker who is considered ""essential"" but whose membership in expedited entry lanes has lapsed to cross the border. The overarching economic worries won't be helped by the border restrictions. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, global trade volumes plunged sharply as consumer demand and business activity dried up, as is currently happening because of coronavirus fears. Two-way U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico also took a hit during the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. exports to its northern neighbor dropped by 21 percent and imports from that country fell by one-third. U.S. exports to Mexico fell nearly 15 percent and imports from below the border fell 18 percent. It took two years for overall U.S. exports to return to pre-crisis levels and three years for imports to fully bounce back. The U.S.-Canada goods trade last year was $612 billion, or about 15 percent of total U.S. trade, according to U.S. Census data. Oil and vehicles and their parts were among the biggest U.S. imports in 2019, while cars, trucks and auto parts were among the top exports to Canada. Trump administration officials say they expect a quick recovery once the coronavirus passes and companies resume full operations and consumers begin spending freely again. Some economists caution that the return to normalcy could be hard to predict. ""In 2008-09, there was a lot of bad debt that needed to be purged of the system. It took several years for the rebound to begin to take hold,"" said Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies. ""It’s unclear how quickly economies will rebound from the pandemic. We are in the process of putting the economy into an induced coma and it’s anyone’s guess how the patient will react once it’s reawakened."" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the coming restrictions “will in no way impede the essential trade happening” across the border, without delving into how that will be defined. “We understand on both sides of the border,” she said. “The last thing the Canadian or U.S. economies need right now is another blow.” DHS did not respond to a request for comment on the forthcoming joint statement, though people who work on cross-border relations said they expect it later Wednesday. Freeland indicated that the restrictions would go into effect within hours or days. The announcement marks the most dramatic limits to the shared land border since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when all ports of entry were shuttered for days. “If there’s anything to learn from 9/11, it’s that decisions governing the management of the border need to be made jointly and that there needs to be absolute clarity about what those decisions mean in terms of facilitating the movement of everyday travelers, workers and goods between the two countries,” said Mark Fisher, president and CEO of the Council of the Great Lakes Region. Daniel Ujczo, an international trade lawyer at Dickinson Wright, said the two countries’ stewardship of the border has drastically changed in the decades since, with greater investments in screening technologies and human resources and border agencies that frequently talk to each other. Plus, he said, the threat this time is known, unlike the days immediately following Sept. 11 when more attacks were feared. Trusted trade programs borne out of that time — FAST, Partners in Protection and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism — also offer a starting point for security officials to determine which businesses should have priority to cross, Ujczo said. “It’s a different reality,” he said. Still, Fisher suggested that some trade flows, like the food and medical supplies already highlighted by Trudeau, may need to be prioritized over others while keeping watch on the economic impacts of the tightened border. “I think certain judgments are going to have to be made,” he said.

"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Biden aides say they are clear-eyed about their financial deficit. But on balance, they're grateful: Every day that passes without a Trump ad onslaught assault amounts to a reprieve. “He’s definitely getting a break,” Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns, said of Biden. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Coronavirus shelves Trump's barrage on Biden,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-biden-coronavirus-136197,politico
"As the globe confronts the coronavirus pandemic, one urgent problem is the shortage of key pieces of equipment, including high-quality masks, test kits and—perhaps most important of all—ventilators. It seems hundreds of thousands of lives might be saved, if only manufacturers could quickly ramp up the production of such equipment, perhaps by a factor of 100 or 1,000, within a few weeks. The United States has done something similar, on a nationwide scale, once before—eight decades ago during the emergency of World War II. At that time, there was a desperate need to radically accelerate the output of items such as ships, tanks and bombers. With decisive government action, including taking a little bit of control from corporations, this effort was hugely successful. Might there be lessons to be learned now, from that history? Here are five takeaways from the World War II industrial mobilization to help inspire creative thinking by business leaders and policymakers today. During World War II, manufacturers of key items were guaranteed that national government agencies would purchase all of their output, even if the equipment ultimately wasn't needed. That was a response to the experience of World War I, during which some contractors had been left holding unwanted goods when the conflict ended suddenly in November 1918. During World War II, the technique of guaranteed sales was used to good effect in the machine tools industry. This was the essential sector that supplied the drills, lathes, grinders and other equipment that all sorts of manufacturers needed to turn pieces of metal into finished products. To encourage maximum production of machine tools, the Tools Division of the War Production Board, an emergency civilian coordinating agency, created what it called the pool-order mechanism, guaranteeing purchases of maximum output. As the official history of the Tools Division put it soon after the war, this device “encouraged output at a rate manufacturers could not have afforded otherwise.” The lesson for 2020 is that if we want more ventilators as soon as possible, the national government needs to guarantee it will purchase them. During World War II, expert manufacturers shared designs and techniques with other firms, so that key items could be produced on multiple production lines, simultaneously. This was done on a grand scale in the U.S. aircraft industry. For example, Pratt & Whitney, the top aircraft engine manufacturer, shared drawings and knowledge with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors, the giant automakers, so that they could mass-produce engines, under licensing agreements with nominal fees. Similarly, Boeing worked with competitors, including Lockheed and Vega, so the Boeing-designed B-17 bomber could be made at its rivals’ plants in California, as well as in the company’s home facility in Seattle. These arrangements were encouraged and facilitated by the U.S. Army Air Forces, which, like other military organizations, served as a top manager and coordinator of the war economy. Today, public authorities and business leaders might use a similar approach, by arranging to have the best versions of key items like tests, ventilators, medications and vaccines made by multiple companies, using temporary deals that would bypass delays that might come from concerns about proprietary technology and competitive advantage. World War II saw the emergency construction of manufacturing plants, the vast majority of which were paid for and owned by U.S. government agencies but operated by companies in the private sector. Indeed, the main mechanism for the biggest expansions of industrial capacity in World War II was the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) plant. The famed Kaiser shipyards, which turned out big merchant vessels in a matter of days, were GOCO facilities, as were most of the big new bomber plants run by the top airframe manufacturers, including Douglas, Martin and North American. The atomic bomb project, like the conventional explosives program, was based on GOCO plants, run by some of the country’s leading corporate manufacturers, including DuPont and Eastman Kodak. By eliminating risk to private producers and their bankers, this model of government financing and ownership proved much more effective than other schemes used during World War II, including tax incentives and government promises to buy privately financed plants over a five-year period. Today, the GOCO model could be useful in cases where new production lines—for respirators, vaccines or other items we realize are now essential—need to be built fast, without waiting to see whether private capital will fund them. The record of World War II shows it is possible, if not easy, to produce emergency alternatives closer to home when global supply chains are disrupted. Many of the combatant nations in World War II did this more than the United States, which was fortunate to have vast natural resources and the world’s largest national economy. But even the U.S. was forced into an all-out emergency scramble to replace imports with new domestic sources, most importantly in the case of rubber. Here American authorities failed to anticipate an enormous problem for the war effort that occurred when Japan’s victories in early 1942 cut off imports of natural rubber from Indonesia. This threatened to cripple the production of items like military trucks and aircraft, which needed rubber for their tires. However, a massive, rapid effort, using GOCO plants and the expertise of oil, chemical and tire companies, allowed the United States to rapidly build from scratch a big new synthetic rubber industry. Today, as the disruption of global supply chains is making it harder to procure a variety of key components for the coronavirus fight, it makes sense for policymakers and business leaders to engage in some quick planning and cooperation, to find and finance domestic substitutes. U.S. authorities successfully contained the problem of profiteering—and, perhaps more important, the problem of public outrage at perceived illegitimate profit-taking in time of crisis—with a multidimensional array of controls. These included direct caps on prices, special war taxes and very high marginal income tax rates on war manufacturers, and congressionally mandated “renegotiation” (clawbacks) of corporate profits deemed by the War and Navy Departments to be excessive. These measures did not prevent all profiteering, nor public complaints about it, but they did improve on the record of World War I. The high taxes paid for nearly half of the war effort (with most of the rest financed by war bonds), keeping deficits in check. Thanks in part to the price and profit controls, public morale—and the legitimacy of private- and public-sector authorities—remained high enough for Americans to sustain an energetic, multiyear mobilization. In 2020, targeted taxes and controls could similarly limit hoarding and profiteering, boosting public morale. And if emergency stimulus measures are so big as to trigger inflation, sharply progressive taxes could be an equitable way to tame a rise in prices, while holding down deficits. To be sure, none of these techniques from 80 years ago might be perfectly applicable to our situation in 2020. Perhaps most important, it is likely that the current mobilization needs to go even faster. During World War II, the giant war plants used to ramp up production took months to build. Today, it would appear that we have not months, but weeks. A quicker mobilization would likely test the limits of some of the technologies that have developed over the past decades, including quick modular construction, computer modeling, 3-D printing and robotics. Nonetheless, despite the different timetable, some of the techniques outlined above, including various forms of public assumption of risk, might remain relevant for today’s policymakers. Of course, today’s crisis makes it clear that there has been systematic underinvestment, over the past several decades, in planning, in-house government labs and plants, surge capacity and public health. One reason for this is that American leaders failed to learn properly from the record of World War II. That failure came not only from forgetfulness or oversight, but also from a deliberate effort to obscure the importance of public investment, public regulation and public coordination by those who preferred a story of World War II in which the only heroes on the homefront were for-profit companies. Today, we need to relearn the real lessons from that war. By using new, creative solutions inspired by a fuller understanding of the real history, we will be better armed to combat the biggest challenges of the 21st century.",The 5 WWII Lessons That Could Help the Government Fight Coronavirus,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/coronavirus-defense-production-world-war-two-lessons-135814,politico

"OTTAWA — Across Canada, provincial health authorities have limited access to coronavirus tests to conserve resources, even as the World Health Organization calls on nations to expand testing to slow the spread of the disease. Several provinces, including Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, are instructing people with mild symptoms of Covid-19 to self-isolate rather than seek testing, partly to guard against shortages. But on Wednesday, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to ""isolate, test, treat and trace."" “If they don’t, transmission chains can continue at a low level, then resurge once physical distancing measures are lifted,"" he told reporters. In Ottawa on Wednesday, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam once again stressed the need to flatten the curve of the virus' spread, pointing to a ""sharp rise in cases"" during the past week. ""This is a signal there is some degree of community spread,"" she said. ""Our time to act is now."" As of Wednesday evening, Canada had recorded nearly 730 confirmed and presumptive cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, including a first death reported in Quebec earlier that day. Though the numbers are clearly increasing, health experts say it’s hard to know how many cases there actually are in Canada, since not everyone with symptoms is being tested. But they disagree about how much the real numbers matter. Some point out that the available data shows the rate of spread, if not the total number of people infected, and say as long as people with symptoms self-isolate, Canada has a chance to slow transmission of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Others counter that people are less likely to self-isolate if they don’t know whether they have Covid-19, and argue it’s much harder to control the virus when you don’t know exactly where it is. David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said testing is the best way to get control of an epidemic early. By the time people start to die, he said, there have likely been generations of transmission that have gone undetected. “And that’s how you get completely hosed by this,” he said. “The testing is kind of our eyes and ears in terms of what’s happening. … I think we’re missing a ton of this stuff.” Fisman said the real number of cases in Canada could be much larger than the number on the books. “We have the sense that our positives are increasing exponentially,” he said. “The question is what fraction of the true total cases does that represent.” Moreover, the cases being confirmed today are likely people who got sick a week ago or more, said University of Toronto epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Kwong. “In an ideal world, we would be testing everybody,” he said. “It’s just the reality is we don’t have the resources to do that.” Ottawa’s medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, has warned there could be hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the city, though there is still no proof of community transmission. Fisman said that may well be the case in many Canadian cities. Even if the confirmed cases are a significant underestimate, though, they still give a sense of the virus’ trajectory, said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre. “I think that as long as we keep doing the same thing … the numbers from one day to the next are telling us something about how the epidemic is growing,” he said. Canada is “actually doing a really good job” at testing, given limited resources, said Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses. “I don’t think the overall accuracy of the definitive numbers is really important at this stage,” he said, pointing instead to the importance of social distancing and self-isolation to flatten the curve of the virus' spread. Still, Dr. William Cherniak, an emergency room physician who has been testing patients for Covid-19 for about a month, said the ideal solution would be a test that people could administer themselves. “My thing is always that knowledge is power,” he said. Self-isolation would be effective “if people really stayed at home for 14 days if they had the symptoms,” he said. But if they haven’t been diagnosed with Covid-19, he believes, they’re less likely to take those instructions seriously.  On Wednesday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced Canada has approved two new diagnostic tests to allow provincial labs to expand testing. “Early diagnosis is a critical component of slowing down the spread of the illness and Canadians can be encouraged that Canada has been leading in terms of our testing capacity,” she said. Certainly, Canada has been doing more testing than the U.S., relative to population size. Tam said Wednesday that more than 50,000 people have been tested for Covid-19 in Canada. Meanwhile, the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run accounting of every coronavirus test administered in the U.S., was reporting a total of about 76,000 tests on Wednesday evening, for a population 10 times the size of Canada's. Still, Canada’s efforts don’t compare to the work being done in South Korea, which now has the ability to test up to 20,000 people a day. What many Canadians are watching for these days is whether this country is on the same trajectory as Italy was a few weeks ago, before its hospitals were flooded with patients needing emergency care. If Canada has any chance of avoiding that, Kindrachuk said, now is the time to take social distancing seriously, regardless of the exact number of cases. “It’s the calm before the storm in a lot of ways. We cannot become complacent,” he said. “If we don’t do anything different, we know where this is going.”","Canada has tested more than 50,000 people for Covid-19.

"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  George echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed to this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country, or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack, but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he issued a national emergency declaration to help combat the global pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president,” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the deadly outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command-and-control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy ships with operating rooms and hospital beds to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist local medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to reposition the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a “green light” for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been internal disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the current economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely since the Comfort is currently undergoing maintenance that could take weeks to complete. (The Mercy, which is currently stationed in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with local police units to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated national guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to try to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date, and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, personal friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is specifically trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Ultimately, Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing that “there is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said “tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak…,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the deadly respiratory syndrome. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the Speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander-in-chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “My beautiful fiancee and I will be celebrating at home, following the White House and CDC’s guidelines.

Todd Rokita (R-Ind.). I was fresh out of college, had no ties to Indiana, no connections in Republican politics and no clue what I was doing.

"Probably for most of us, the coronavirus crisis will soon enough—Six months? A year?—recede in our minds and come to seem like a hallucinatory moment. Maybe it will be like a hurricane that forced everyone to rush inland and then only glanced the coast.  Or maybe it will be like a hurricane that really does hit. Even then, human nature being what it is, most people will clean up and move on. Yet no matter how the coronavirus pandemic passes, or how quickly, there is likely in these strange housebound weeks a new political epoch being born. There are two large reasons to believe the political echo of this crisis will last much longer than the crisis itself. The first is that many of the people whose expectations and routines are most dramatically upended by the pandemic are students. The interruption, and in some cases irreplaceable loss, of important experiences in their education, as campuses empty and untold events are canceled, will likely shape their consciousness in more lasting ways than for the rest of us. Like most catastrophes, the pandemic’s malign consequences will fall most heavily on the underprivileged. Unlike most catastrophes, its costs are also being paid heavily by some segments of the most privileged. Those college seniors whose spring terms and graduation ceremonies are suddenly deleted include many people who are future leaders of the public and private sectors. No, it’s not the end of the world for them. But it’s a piercing loss even so—one being paid more for the benefit of older, less healthy people than for pure self-protection. More profoundly, the dynamics of the coronavirus moment likely will resemble the dynamics of other great public policy issues shadowing the next generation. In particular, the global pandemic and the harsh choices it imposes offer—in highly concentrated fashion in coming months—much the same choices that responses to global climate change will impose in coming decades. Like the coronavirus emergency, climate change is a problem whose dimensions are largely the province of scientific experts—employing complex data models aimed at illuminating future trends that the average citizen can understand in broad concept but not in detail. The essential question: Do you trust these experts, or not? Like the coronavirus, climate change is a problem for which remedies are not solely the province of experts but are primarily the realm of community values. These remedies involve tangible and immediate costs for benefits that are abstract and imponderable.  In the case of coronavirus, for instance, the shutdown of the economy required by enforcing social distancing imposes costs that are immediate and quite likely already in your midst—layoffs of someone you know, uncertainty about future income, concern for a favorite neighborhood business about to go under. As to the benefits, meanwhile, no one knows—certainly not now, maybe not ever. Perhaps the massive response won’t really be effective and a public health catastrophe unfolds anyway. Or maybe the response in retrospect will seem overblown. In the case of climate change, the tension between immediate certain consequences—whether paying a carbon tax or substantially altering consumption habits—for diffuse and distant benefits is more acute. The rewards for the deep and comprehensive changes needed to replace a carbon-fueled economy and halt the warming of the planet will be enjoyed—one hopes—primarily by people not yet born. Finally, of course, coronavirus is like climate change in the sense that it is impervious to national borders. One way to gauge the power of these currents—crisis fueled by frightening science—is by watching the change in President Donald Trump. There is no way to know for certain what the coronavirus means for his reelection. But already it is evident what it has meant for Trumpism. It has sent it hurtling into retreat. Trumpism as an idea is about promoting and protecting American sovereignty and singularity. In some contexts, even Trump foes might agree it’s an attractive concept: Well might we wish to seal our borders from the virus. But the only way this would be effective would be if the United States had years ago opted to adjourn from the modern interconnected global economy. Yes, the coronavirus first presented itself in China. How many people were surprised to learn only in the past few weeks that nearly all U.S. antibiotics also come from China. Trumpism as a style is defined not just by boasting and bluster; his triumphalism depends on projecting certitude. The president early on acted as if he could indeed create reality by proclamation, when he assured the public that U.S. infections would soon be down to zero. Only in recent days, as the possibility of widespread domestic disease mounts, has Trump acknowledged imprecision—the fragmentary nature of our understanding of how far the virus has spread, how effective efforts to blunt its impact will be, or when these efforts will be deemed sufficient.  One way to appreciate the murkiness of our circumstances—and the moral implications of this murkiness—is to view them through the eyes of young people. No need to overstate things. Missing spring semester is not the same as dodging sniper fire in Kabul, nor the same as being laid off from your job handling bags at O’Hare.  But nor should one understate things. Suppose baseball has been your consuming passion since age 6 and now at 22 you are expecting one last idyll as team captain. Now that season will never happen. Maybe you were planning to spend the semester in Peru and are now scrambling to see if you can find a flight home. Planes and restaurants will fill up again. In all likelihood that semester abroad is gone for good. Psych 101 perhaps can be taken remotely; the exhilarating 1 a.m. conversation in the dorm lounge will not be.  Out of curiosity, I read various college and university presidents’ letters announcing the closure of their campuses. Most were filled with the same kind of bromides as your workplace or mine offered about caring first and foremost for the health and etc., etc., of our community. One letter, by Williams College president Maud Mandel, stuck out for its candor: “A healthy person could reasonably choose to stay and accept the personal risk of catching COVID-19, but the decision would unacceptably increase the chance of contagion for others.” Indeed, that 21-year-old might plausibly calculate, even if he or she gets sick the chances are, not for everybody but for most, that it would be a miserable few days rather than life-threatening illness. Those institutions closed less to protect their campus communities than to protect the broader society. The coronavirus pandemic does not remotely have the cataclysmic shock and violence of 9/11. For many people, however, the virus’ actual day-in, day-out impact will be more pervasive. 9-11 was followed by a period, which turned out to be short-lived, of national connection and goodwill. Trump, who has made mockery and castigation of opponents his signature, surely did not conjure fuzzy feelings from many quarters with his appeal at the White House on Wednesday that, “We are all in this together.” Yet the pandemic has a logic that transcends politics and personal feeling. Never mind how one feels about Trump. Never mind how we feel about one another. The reality of a dangerous virus is that we are all in this together.

"Coronavirus has finally reached Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a ninth-term Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, a freshman Democrat from Utah, revealed on Wednesday that they had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first U.S. lawmakers to contract the virus that‘s spreading across the country. Diaz-Balart, 58, said he began to develop symptoms on Saturday, just hours after he left the House floor for a vote on a coronavirus response bill. More than 400 members of Congress also voted during the early-Saturday session. Diaz-Balart’s statement indicates he decided to “self-quarantine in Washington D.C.” after the vote. His statement doesn’t indicate why he believed he needed to self-quarantine before developing symptoms or whether he informed staff or other members of Congress that he might have exposed them to the illness. “I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” Diaz-Balart said in the statement. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.” McAdams, 45, also said his symptoms began mildly on Saturday night, after he had returned to Utah. He immediately began self-quarantining on the advice of his doctor. “My symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough and labored breathing and I remained self-quarantined,“ McAdams said in a statement. “On Tuesday, my doctor instructed me to get tested for COVID-19 and following his referral, I went to the local testing clinic for the test. Today I learned that I tested positive.“ Diaz-Balart said he decided to remain in Washington on Saturday because he was concerned about being in his South Florida home, where his wife, who has a pre-existing condition, would be “at exceptionally high risk.” Like Diaz-Balart, McAdams didn‘t indicate whether he had urged any of his colleagues or aides to self-quarantine. The news of two members testing positive has already begun rippling across Congress. Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.) said on Wednesday night that the House doctor had advised him to self-quarantine until March 27 because he “was in contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19.“ The House minority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), said on Wednesday that he, too, would self-quarantine because he had held an “extended meeting“ with Diaz-Balart late last week. Scalise is now the highest-ranking lawmaker to self-quarantine amid the outbreak. Overnight, four more lawmakers announced self-quarantines. Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) told the Miami Herald that she would isolate herself and that another member of the Florida delegation was being tested based on symptoms. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) also announces self-quarantines.  Though Diaz-Balart and McAdams are the first in Congress to develop coronavirus, the illness has struck among a small number of congressional aides. It’s sure to heighten already-acute fears on Capitol Hill that members themselves, particularly the high proportion of elderly lawmakers, are vulnerable when they meet in Washington. The development appears likely to revive an internal House debate about whether to permit remote voting for lawmakers amid a pandemic that‘s ravaging the country, pummeling the economy and limiting members‘ ability to travel across the country.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have resisted the idea, worrying that it would set a damaging precedent for the future and signal a lack of confidence from government in the country‘s fight against coronavirus. But with two lawmakers ill and untold others exposed, some lawmakers say it‘s time to think again. “In. Person. Voting. Should. Be. Reconsidered,“ Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a freshman Democrat from Florida, said in a tweet late Wednesday. “For the safety of our communities, during this emergency, we must be able to legislate from our districts.“ Earlier in the day, 50 lawmakers of both parties wrote to House leaders asking them to reconsider remote voting as well, arguing that Congress must hold itself to the same standards it‘s asking of other Americans.",First 2 members of Congress test positive for coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/first-member-of-congress-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-136300,politico
"The Labor Department reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a 70,000 jump over the previous week that it attributed to the coronavirus epidemic. It was the highest level of claims since September 2017 and the first in a flood of unfavorable economic indicators expected from the Trump administration as businesses shut down and workers go home. Unemployment claims will likely rise higher in coming months as job growth ends, the unemployment rate rises, and GDP sags. The only question is how long the bad times will last, and that will depend on how fast and how far the virus spreads. DOL's new unemployment number records claims filed during the week ending March 14. But reports from unemployment insurance offices around the country indicated the real explosion in claims began this past weekend, and continued unabated this week. In Colorado, nearly 11,000 unemployment claims were filed Monday and Tuesday, compared to only 400 claims filed the previous Monday. In New Jersey, 15,000 people applied for unemployment benefits on Monday, a number twelve times higher than normal levels. Pennsylvania was on track to see more than 100,000 claims on Monday and Tuesday, compared to 12,000 during first week of March. And in the 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places, workers filed nearly ten times as many claims as during the entire week one year earlier. Jacob Robbins, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who tracks unemployment insurance claims, estimated that in 14 states roughly 340,000 claims were made on March 16 and March 17 alone — more than fifty percent more than were reported nationwide during the previous week. The surge in unemployment claims accompanied widespread reports of layoffs nationwide. New York-based Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, laid off 80 percent of its workers. On Tuesday Marriott said it expects to lay off tens of thousands of workers worldwide. MGM Resorts International closed 150 restaurants and bars Monday. Experts predicted millions of job losses. The Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 3000 jobs have been lost already, and that job losses could rise as high as 9 million. The Senate on Wednesday passed a multibillion dollar emergency aid package to counter the economic slowdown that included $2 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Senate Republicans are also working on a proposal for a third, larger stimulus package to address the epidemic that likely will include $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. Earlier this month DOL advised states that workers affected by the coronavirus are eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. The agency said that states would be permitted to pay benefits to individuals quarantined with the expectation of returning to work, and to those who leave employment to avoid exposure to coronavirus or to care for a sick family member. But it's not clear how well, even with the additional $2 billion in federal assistance, the state unemployment system will cushion the blow. Some state unemployment insurance programs have reduced the number of weeks workers can receive benefits since the last economic downturn in 2007-09. In addition, 22 states and jurisdictions, including California, New York, Illinois and Texas, are also facing dangerously low reserves.",Coronavirus drives up unemployment claims ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-drives-up-unemployment-claims-137067,politico

"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened fewer than one million travelers on March 17 — making it the slowest day at airports since the so-called “Snowpocalypse“ in 2011.  According to new data from the TSA, the agency screened 983,226 on Tuesday. That was the fewest daily travelers going through TSA checkpoints since Feb. 1, 2011, when a massive blizzard snarled air traffic across North America. Before Snowpocalypse, the last day when TSA officers screened fewer than a million travelers was May 30, 2004, per the agency’s numbers.  As the U.S. has closed its borders to much of Europe and public health officials have warned people against taking unnecessary flights, year-to-day traveler numbers have plummeted. On March 14, a million fewer people passed through TSA checkpoints than did on the same Saturday in 2019.  TSA officials are at the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The agency has revealed that at least eight of its employees have contracted the virus, which has sickened at least thirteen total Department of Homeland Security officials, per documents POLITICO reviewed. And two sources with knowledge of the situation also said that two contractors from the department’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office have tested positive for the virus. That office plays a role in airport screenings designed to slow the virus’s spread.  The aviation industry has taken a body blow since the coronavirus has spread. The American airline industry’s trade group put out a statement March 16 saying airlines were seeing “a dramatic decline in demand, which is getting worse by the day.” The industry implored the federal government to give it loans, grants, and tax relief, saying the economic situation is “simply not sustainable.” The industry group has sought tens of billions in help from Washington, per CNN.  President Donald Trump said on March 18 that the industry can expect some sort of bailout.  “Airlines would be No. 1,” he said, per USA Today. “You go from having the best year they have ever had to having no passengers because of what we have had to do to win this war — and it’s a war.”  But any bailout will raise tricky political questions — especially since Trump himself lambasted the Obama administration’s auto industry rescue. And Congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have telegraphed that they see any aid package as a chance to call for worker protections and differentiate themselves from Republicans going into the 2020 campaign, as The Washington Post has detailed.  Another complicating factor: According to a Bloomberg report, America’s biggest airlines spent the vast majority of their free cash flow over the last 10 years buying back their own stock. Schumer said on the Senate floor that the companies instead should have saved that money “for a rainy day.”",Airport screenings dip below 1 million per day,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/airport-screenings-dip-below-1-million-per-day-136840,politico

"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Biden aides say they are clear-eyed about their financial deficit. But on balance, they're grateful: Every day that passes without a Trump ad onslaught assault amounts to a reprieve. “He’s definitely getting a break,” Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns, said of Biden. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Trump wanted to bury Biden after the primary.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged Thursday the U.S. faces months of economic contraction, but predicted a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent up demand” and return to “a normal world.”  In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he believes the economy will see its largest decline in this year’s second quarter, from April through June, followed by a third-quarter recovery as advancements in viral treatments and vaccines eventually halt the spread of the virus.  ""I think you’re going to see a lot of pent-up demand,"" Mnuchin told Bartiromo. ""When we get through the next few months and Americans see what’s happening, and we have killed this virus, people are going to be comfortable going back to work.""  Mnuchin continued: ""We're going to be opening back business and people are going to continue what they do. They are going to live. They are going to shop. They are going to eat out. They are going to enjoy restaurants and travel and entertainment and we will go back to a normal world.”  Bartiromo pressed Mnuchin on company bailouts — a term he continues to push against. He emphasized Thursday that many of these companies will ultimately pay back any loans.  “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need.""  ""In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans. In the case of small businesses, if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them,"" he continued. ""I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.”  Mnuchin also clarified his reported warning to Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could spike to 20 percent if action is not taken. “What I said is that 40 percent of our workforce is in small business,"" he explained. ""And I said, if half of them were let go, mathematically, we’d be at 20 percent unemployment.”  Mnuchin’s upbeat outlook comes alongside grim new data emerging from the federal government. The Labor Department on Thursday reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week, a jump it attributed to the pandemic. It was the highest number of claims since September 2017, and economists expect that figure to soar in the coming weeks. Asked if economic data should be ignored in this volatile environment, Mnuchin replied, “The statistics in the short run of economics are obviously not relevant.

"A decade of sharp cuts to state unemployment programs threatens to leave laid-off workers more vulnerable than during the Great Recession. With 10 states having reduced since the 2007-09 recession the maximum weeks employees can receive unemployment benefits, many state unemployment systems will be less generous to the unemployed than they were during that earlier downturn — even with the $1 billion boost that unemployment insurance is set to receive in the legislative package before Congress. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, recipients can stop receiving unemployment benefits after 12 weeks, despite predictions from public health officials and economic experts that the economic aftereffects from the coronavirus pandemic could last much longer. Meanwhile, nearly half of U.S. states and jurisdictions are running dangerously low on unemployment cash, further limiting the amount of stimulus they can deliver to weather the economic fallout. “Unemployment insurance is about more than just giving somebody a check when they’re unemployed,"" said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. ""It’s a macroeconomic stabilizer.” The generosity of unemployment benefits varies greatly among states. Unemployed workers in South Carolina and Missouri may receive $1,500 less and $1,400 less, respectively, than they would have heading into the Great Recession, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report. Workers in Kansas could receive $2,000 less, and workers in North Carolina could lose $2,700. Congress’ coronavirus response package would offer states some relief but do little to expand benefits, which are set at the state level. The House-passed bill would give $500 million to help states process the expected surge in unemployment claims, and another $500 million in administrative assistance grants to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment. This second $500 million is conditioned on states waiving work-search requirements, waiting periods and penalties for employers that lay off workers. But it isn't conditioned on states extending benefits for any particular length of time. Federal assistance to state unemployment systems accounts by law for half the number of weeks that states already offer. Consequently, the states that cover the fewest number of weeks would receive the least help from any increase. For example, a state that offers 20 weeks' unemployment benefits would get 10 extra weeks' federal funding, while a state that offers 26 weeks would get 13. “That is a further consequence of the cutbacks that have taken place in a number of states — it also cuts back on the amount of extra weeks you get in a recession,” said Chad Stone, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. After the Great Recession, businesses lobbied, often successfully, to limit state taxes to increase state reserves for unemployment insurance, which the recession had depleted. Many states did so by cutting benefits for recipients. An individual employer’s payment rate for state unemployment insurance is typically tied to how many workers the employer lays off, much like a motorist who sees his or her insurance go up after an accident. Cutting benefits was a way to replenish the trust fund while limiting tax increases on business. “At some point, it gets to be a level where employers come to policymakers and say, ‘Hey, this is crazy. I want to hire people but I can’t afford to, because the payroll tax I would have for that is so high,’” said Matt Weidinger, a researcher at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package denied unemployment assistance to states that cut benefits. But according to Weidinger, states found a loophole: They could receive the assistance if they maintained the same level of benefits but cut the number of weeks these benefits could be received. On the whole, experts agree that state trust funds are in better shape than before the last recession. An AEI report that Weidinger published this month shows aggregate state trust fund balances at 76 billion, 40 percent higher than in 2007. The majority of states maintain sufficient unemployment insurance reserves to weather a recession, according to Labor Department data. But there remain 22 states and jurisdictions — including populous states like California, New York, Texas and Illinois — that have dangerously low reserves. As the crisis worsens, states are beginning to act on their own. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday that even before Congress compels him to, he will waive his state’s one-week waiting period and suspend work-search requirements for recipients, in part to help workers suffering from a state closure of bars and restaurants. On Monday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expanded unemployment benefits from 20 to 26 weeks and said that it will cover those taking care of family members. “We’re very mindful of the economic hurt for individuals who will lose their jobs,” DeWine said Sunday. “Look, this is brutally tough. And my heart goes out to them. But we have to do what we have to do to save their lives.”",Many states are ill-prepared for unemployment benefits surge,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/many-states-are-ill-prepared-for-unemployment-benefits-surge-137371,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday morning, State issued a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information.  It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later.  ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.”  “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said.  Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens.Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday that she would end her presidential campaign, formally winnowing the 2020 Democratic field to a two-man race between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. ""Today, I'm suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to Vice President Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,"" Gabbard said in a video statement posted online. In endorsing Biden, Gabbard said that ""although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he's motivated by his love for our country and the American people."" ""I'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha, respect and compassion, and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart,"" she added. Gabbard closely tied the reasons for her withdrawal from the race to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying that ""the best way that I can be of service at this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and to stand ready to serve in uniform should the Hawaii National Guard be activated.""  Gabbard previously served two tours in the Middle East with the Hawaii Army National Guard — in Iraq from 2004-2005 and in Kuwait from 2008-2009 — and stepped away from her campaign in August to report for active duty, participating in a two-week joint training exercise in Indonesia. Apart from Biden and Sanders, Gabbard outlasted all of her Democratic rivals to become the third remaining White House hopeful in what began as a historically diverse and crowded pack of candidates.  The Hawaii lawmaker faced significant criticism for her seemingly quixotic decision to stay in the race beyond the early nominating contests, and now finishes her campaign with only two pledged delegates — less than several of her former rivals who dropped out weeks ago. But Gabbard, long a controversial figure within the Democratic field, had little to lose after declaring in October that she would not seek reelection to a fifth term in Congress, a prospect complicated by a formidable primary challenger and thorny relationships with other Hawaii politicians. She had also become the subject of widespread skepticism among national Democrats, often rebuked for her past anti-LGBT rhetoric, isolationist brand of diplomacy and 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom she declined to label a war criminal despite the dictator's use of chemical weapons to attack his own people. Gabbard typically polled better with independents than self-identified Democrats, and acquired some support from fringe conservatives. She was frequently referenced in Russian media and propaganda, prompting a high-profile clash with Hillary Clinton after the 2016 Democratic nominee claimed the congresswoman was the ""favorite"" of Moscow. Although Gabbard's last appearance in a primary debate was in November, before the Democratic National Committee raised its bar participate, she emerged as a fiery on-stage presence — blasting other candidates for their records and proposals on foreign policy, criminal justice and the impeachment of President Donald Trump, among other issues.  Her exit from the race Thursday after weeks of defying political pressure to drop out reflects the new nature of the Democratic primary, which has become frozen in place amid the COVID-19 outbreak and seen Biden mount a nearly insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders. The senator's campaign manager announced Wednesday he would ""assess"" the state of his White House bid in the days ahead.","Tulsi Gabbard ends White House bid, endorses Biden",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/tulsi-gabbard-ends-white-house-bid-137242,politico
"The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will self-quarantine for a week, after he shook hands with Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart days before the Florida Republican developed coronavirus symptoms, the agency confirmed this morning. Steve Dickson and Diaz-Balart shook hands before an appropriations hearing on March 11. Diaz-Balart has said that he developed a headache and fever the night of March 14. He and Rep.

"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. The highly unusual State Department travel advisory is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, after President Donald Trump first moved to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have moved to close their borders and impose further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday.

"Climate activists are retooling their strategy for an online existence during the coronavirus pandemic. As mass gatherings are canceled around the world to promote ""social distancing,"" a loose coalition of youth-focused activists has been plotting how to stay relevant without the large demonstrations that have become a staple of the climate movement. Organizers are nixing public rallies and looking for new approaches to stay active in the 2020 campaign without an opportunity to confront politicians in public. “We’re an organization of a bunch of millennials and Generation Z so in many ways we grew up online and are well-equipped to meet this moment,” Evan Weber, national political director for Sunrise Movement, told POLITICO. Global Climate Strike, a coalition inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg's Friday school strikes, has suspended the weekly demonstrations that brought thousands of people to the streets in the U.S. and around the world. Thunberg last week encouraged supporters to participate in a ""digital strike"" instead of gathering in public, and coalition members have been on wall-to-wall calls this week to figure how to keep up public pressure on governments to fight climate change. In the U.S., Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Sunrise Movement and other green groups canceled three days of nationwide protests in April coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. The Sunrise Movement has suspended a voter registration drive on college campuses that aimed to sign up 125,000 new voters; the group registered about 1,000 new voters in Iowa but had planned to kick the campaign into high gear after Earth Day, Weber said. Instead it will next week launch “Sunrise School,” a series of online classes to train high school and college students on organizing and campaigning tactics. The group is also drafting a ""list of demands"" outlining how former Vice President Joe Biden can win their votes if he becomes the Democratic nominee. But where Sunrise members have previously been able to get to Biden on the rope line at a campaign event, it will now have to submit those demands electronically. The League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, one of the environmental movement's largest voter registration programs, has taken a hit because it depends ""on face-to-face interactions,"" Hilda Nucete, the fund's deputy director of civic engagement said in a statement. ""While this is a short-term blow to our in-person voter registration goals, we are not slowing our efforts to increase civic participation,"" she said. ""We are exploring an expansion of our existing digital, mail and phone-based strategies to continue voter engagement during this time and compensate for lost face-to-face opportunities."" Zero Hour and National Children's Campaign, two youth-led groups, had to postpone their voter registration bus tour that was to swing through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin beginning Friday. The groups are targeting new dates in July in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention, said Jonah Gottlieb, co-founder and executive director with the National Children's Campaign. In the absence of rallies and door-to-door canvassing, organizers are stepping up online recruitment and organizing phone banks, noting many people are sitting at home yearning for something to do. Katie Eder, executive director of Future Coalition, a youth-centered climate advocacy group, said coalition members are brainstorming ideas this week and intend to announce more detailed plans next week. Activities could include digital town halls with appearances from celebrities and politicians are being planned to replace the sit-ins at banks, marches and concerts planned for Earth Day. Gaming Facebook’s algorithm to increase visibility, such as encouraging supporters to “check in” for a potential multi-day livestreamed Earth Day event — a tactic previously used during protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline — is under consideration, too. None of that can replace in-person action, but it can potentially help keep people engaged, said Jamie Henn, an activist who is coordinating sit-ins at banks to protest fossil fuel investments through a coalition called Stop the Money Pipeline. Focus is required. Tactics need to “go beyond just tweeting a lot.” “There will be a lot of experimentation in the weeks to come to figure out what works and what makes an impact,” he said. “That’s the challenge right now in the progressive movement. What can we do that continues to hit home?” Dana Fisher, a University of Maryland sociology professor who has studied movements for 20 years, said young climate activists may be uniquely well suited to the current moment because they are far less reliant on in-person meetings than activists in earlier generations. “They just all go on Zoom,” she said, referring to the online video conferencing platform. “Why would I leave my house if I don’t have to?” May Boeve, executive director of climate activism group 350.org, said her organization has operated virtually since it sprung out of campus efforts to fight pipeline construction over a decade ago. Her group has put out training materials and other aids to assist with “navigating this new paradigm,” though she admitted having concrete impact for online-only activism “requires a lot of creativity.” “There are people really trying to test the limit of what virtual meetings can do,” she said, noting much of the heavy lifting for events already occurs online. ""The end product of it is people gathering in the streets but there’s a lot that happens in the street. Obviously it’s the last part of that process where people are having to really stretch.”",Climate activists shift gears in an age of 'social distancing',2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/climate-activists-social-distancing-coronavirus-137216,politico

"The Labor Department reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week that it attributed to the coronavirus epidemic. It was the highest level of claims since September 2017 and the first in a flood of unfavorable economic indicators expected from the Trump administration as businesses shut down and workers go home. Unemployment claims will likely rise higher in coming months as job growth ends, the unemployment rate rises, and GDP sags. ""Today’s hurricane-sized increase is nothing compared to what we can expect in coming weeks,"" Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a prepared statement. ""The full weight of this economic shock is still ramping up."" The only question is how long the bad times will last, and that will depend on how fast and how far the virus spreads. According to DOL, layoffs were concentrated in service related industries, as well as in transportation and warehousing. The latest unemployment number covers claims filed during the week ending March 14. But reports from unemployment insurance offices around the country indicated the real explosion in claims began this past weekend, and continued unabated this week. In Colorado, nearly 11,000 unemployment claims were filed Monday and Tuesday, compared to only 400 claims filed the previous Monday. In New Jersey, 15,000 people applied for unemployment benefits on Monday, a number twelve times higher than normal levels. Pennsylvania was on track to see more than 100,000 claims on Monday and Tuesday, compared to 12,000 during first week of March. And in the 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places, workers filed nearly ten times as many claims as during the entire week one year earlier. Jacob Robbins, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who tracks unemployment insurance claims, estimated that in 14 states roughly 340,000 claims were made on March 16 and March 17 alone — more than fifty percent more than were reported nationwide during the previous week. The surge in unemployment claims accompanied widespread reports of layoffs nationwide. New York-based Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, laid off 80 percent of its workers. On Tuesday Marriott said it expects to lay off tens of thousands of workers worldwide. MGM Resorts International closed 150 restaurants and bars Monday. Experts predicted millions of job losses. The Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 3000 jobs have been lost already, and that job losses could rise as high as 9 million. The Senate on Wednesday passed a multibillion dollar emergency aid package to counter the economic slowdown that included $2 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Senate Republicans are also working on a proposal for a third, larger stimulus package to address the epidemic that likely will include $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. Earlier this month DOL advised states that workers affected by the coronavirus are eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. The agency said that states would be permitted to pay benefits to individuals quarantined with the expectation of returning to work, and to those who leave employment to avoid exposure to coronavirus or to care for a sick family member. But it's not clear how well, even with the additional $2 billion in federal assistance, the state unemployment system will cushion the blow. Some state unemployment insurance programs have since the last economic downturn in 2007-reduced the number of weeks workers can receive benefits. In addition, 22 states and jurisdictions, including California, New York, Illinois and Texas, are also facing dangerously low reserves. “Today’s numbers reveal that while Congress considers new strategies to help the unemployed, Americans are turning to a jobless safety net that is unable to meet their needs,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation said in an emailed statement. Policymakers should lift the current 26-week cap on jobless benefits, he said, and ""states should be required to roll back cuts that have lingered since the end of the last recession.”",Coronavirus drives up unemployment claims ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-drives-up-unemployment-claims-137067,politico
"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened fewer than one million travelers on March 17 — making it the slowest day at airports since the so-called “Snowpocalypse“ in 2011.  According to new data from the TSA, the agency screened 983,226 on Tuesday. That was the fewest daily travelers going through TSA checkpoints since Feb. 1, 2011, when a massive blizzard snarled air traffic across North America. Before Snowpocalypse, the last day when TSA officers screened fewer than a million travelers was May 30, 2004, per the agency’s numbers.  As the U.S. has closed its borders to much of Europe and public health officials have warned people against taking unnecessary flights, year-to-day traveler numbers have plummeted. On March 14, a million fewer people passed through TSA checkpoints than did on the same Saturday in 2019.  TSA officials are at the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The agency has revealed that at least eight of its employees have contracted the virus, which has sickened at least thirteen total Department of Homeland Security officials, per documents POLITICO reviewed. And two sources with knowledge of the situation also said that two contractors from the department’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office have tested positive for the virus. That office plays a role in airport screenings designed to slow the virus’s spread.  The aviation industry has taken a body blow since the coronavirus has spread. The U.S. airline industry’s trade group this week warned carriers were seeing “a dramatic decline in demand, which is getting worse by the day.” The industry implored the federal government to give it loans, grants, and tax relief, saying the economic situation is “simply not sustainable.” The industry group has sought tens of billions in help from Washington, and lawmakers are debating provisions.  President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the industry can expect some sort of bailout.  “Airlines would be No. 1,” he said. “You go from having the best year they have ever had to having no passengers because of what we have had to do to win this war — and it’s a war.”  But any bailout will raise tricky political questions — especially since Trump himself lambasted the Obama administration’s auto industry rescue. And congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have telegraphed that they see any aid package as a chance to call for worker protections and differentiate themselves from Republicans going into the 2020 campaign. Another complicating factor: America’s biggest airlines poured money into buying back their own stock over the past decade. Schumer said on the Senate floor that the companies instead should have saved that money “for a rainy day.”",Airport screenings dip below 1 million per day,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/airport-screenings-dip-below-1-million-per-day-136840,politico
"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  Asha George, the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed to this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Civil War effectively ended at Appomattox, Va. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he declared a national emergency to help combat the pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together,because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command and control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy hospital ships to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to deploy the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a green light for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely because the Comfort is undergoing maintenance that could take weeks. The Mercy, homeported in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with police to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated National Guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients, and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing, “There is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said, “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the respiratory syndrome, which can be deadly. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander in chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Senior Biden aides are clear-eyed about their financial deficit compared to Trump but they insist they’ll have the necessary firepower to combat whatever is coming. At the same time, they’re unconvinced that Trump will refrain from attacks even in the face of a pandemic.  “The American people know who Joe Biden is and what his values are,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. The aides note that Republicans launched ads critical of Biden as early as last fall in early primary states and the former vice president has still emerged the presumptive nominee.  Still, Biden is “definitely getting a break,” said Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Trump wanted to bury Biden after the primary.

"President Donald Trump said he will ""slash red tape like nobody has even done it before"" in a bid to get unapproved coronavirus treatments to patients faster and identify effective drugs. The president said Thursday he directed the Food and Drug Administration to ""eliminate out-of-date rules and bureaucracy so this can go forward fast"" — but he did not offer any details. Instead, Trump and top health officials highlighted steps the government has taken in recent weeks to launch clinical trials of potential coronavirus treatments. Trump's remarks came one day after he teased that an ""exciting FDA announcement"" was on the way — news that reportedly caught some in the health agency by surprise as they scrambled to finalize details, said three HHS officials. The president suggested certain programs that the administration could use to get experimental drugs to people quickly outside of clinical trials. One such route, known as ""Right to Try,"" was established by a 2018 law that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence supported to help people who are seriously ill and have no other treatment options. ""What we're talking about today is beyond Right to Try,"" Trump said, adding that the law ""has been a tremendous success."" That program allows patients to appeal directly to drugmakers to use medicines that are still being developed and tested. Bioethicists and drug policy experts argue there are other ways to help people access experimental medicine — like the FDA’s compassionate use route, also name checked by the president — and that Right to Try fuels false hope, while making it difficult to collect data on how well the drugs work. The drugmaker Gilead has provided its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to patients with coronavirus under compassionate use rules first established in 1987. The National Institutes of Health has also started a clinical trial of the drug in coronavirus patients. Trump name-checked remdesivir at Thursday's briefing, along with two drugs that have been used for decades to treat malaria. He suggested that the malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, could be effective against coronavirus — but the data is still sparse. It is unclear how many people have been treated under the federal Right to Try law for any condition. There are at least nine publicly reported cases. The libertarian Goldwater Institute, which spearheaded efforts to pass the legislation, says at least six of those involved people who received experimental brain cancer vaccine. Goldwater this week pushed for Right to Try to be used amid the coronavirus outbreak. Others are more skeptical about the program's usefulness during the current crisis. ""A lot of these [drug] products are already being deployed through clinical trials as well as compassionate use or emergency use authorities,"" Steve Ubl, CEO of the drug lobby PhRMA, said Wednesday when asked about the Right to Try push. ""I'll leave it at that."" Bioethicists were quick to sound the alarm when Goldwater floated the idea, arguing it would fuel false claims and panic around the outbreak. “Right now, to push the Right to Try pathway seems really irresponsible and dangerous,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a bioethicist at University of Pennsylvania. “This is the type of thing that's critically important to preserve clinical trials for or we’re not going to be able to figure out whether this stuff works.” Trump has urged manufacturers to get treatments and vaccines to patients quickly even as other officials have warned that creating an effective vaccine, in particular, will take at least a year. The FDA this week also let researchers alter clinical trials to keep subjects safe during the outbreak and allow for scientists to assess patients remotely. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" the agency's commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said Thursday. Hahn instead appeared to lean on compassionate use rather than the newer Right to Try law. ""The important thing about compassionate use — and that's what the president meant [with] this is beyond Right to Try — is that we get to collect the information,"" he said. “At this point, the issues that we have been raising with the administration have been focused more on logistics and ensuring that we online to have the free flow of goods to make sure that we can meet patient needs,” PhRMA’s Ubl told reporters Wednesday when asked about the lobby’s goals amid the government’s response.

"Weeks before President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, Sen. Richard Burr privately offered a grim prognosis for the outbreak while previewing some of the massive disruptions soon to come, according to a previously unreported recording obtained by NPR.  In the recording, which NPR reports came from the North Carolina Republican's remarks at a private luncheon late last month, Burr said that the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak ""is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic,"" which killed an estimated 50 million worldwide.  ""There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,"" said Burr, who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr also authored the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the 2006 law that formulated the federal response to outbreaks. In his comments to the Tar Heel Circle in North Carolina on Feb. 27, Burr gave attendees a chilling warning about the severity of the coronavirus at a time when there were only a little over a dozen reported confirmed cases in the U.S. and President Donald Trump was suggesting that number would drop down to zero in short order. But many of Burr’s warnings to the group later came to pass. He instructed attendees to reconsider traveling to Europe, a suggestion that came about two weeks before the president announced a travel ban for foreigners coming to the U.S. from most of Europe. ""You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference. Why risk it?"" he asked the group. The senator also said that the virus could prompt the shuttering of schools, something that happened in his home state a couple of weeks later.  “There will be, I'm sure, times that communities, probably some in North Carolina, have a transmission rate where they say, let's close schools for two weeks, everybody stay home,” he says in the recording. Burr even forecast the mobilization of the military, something that has only begun to happen in recent days on a wider scale. ""We're going to send a military hospital there, it's going to be in tents and going to be set up on the ground somewhere,"" he predicted, noting that ""It's going to be a decision the president and DoD make. And we're going to have medical professionals supplemented by local staff to treat the people that need treatment.”  Burr's tone in private went well beyond an op-ed he co-authored with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), reassuring Americans that although they were rightfully concerned about the outbreak, it was being properly handled by the authorities. ""Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump administration,"" the two senators wrote. ""The work of Congress and the administration has allowed U.S. public health officials to move swiftly and decisively in the last few weeks."" The Trump administration has faced fierce criticism for not taking the outbreak seriously enough at its outset and for fumbling the early testing process — issues the White House is still scrambling to address.

"House Democratic leaders on Thursday announced that lawmakers will not be required to return to Washington until the next stimulus package for the coronavirus pandemic is ready for a vote, part of an attempt to limit exposure to the virus among members of Congress. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer informed members that he will be “adjusting” the House schedule to require less time at the Capitol and halt the virus’ spread among lawmakers — at least two of whom have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. “It is my intention that the House will not return to session until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis,” Hoyer said in a letter to Democrats. Democratic leaders are also looking to reassure members who have grown increasingly anxious about the virus’ spread in the Capitol, and fear the situation could worsen if hundreds of members are forced to be in a single room together. Hoyer confirmed that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point. The Maryland Democrat did not address the possibility of allowing members to vote remotely from their districts, an idea that has steadily gained traction — particularly among West Coast lawmakers — amid the rapidly intensifying outbreak. “I share the concerns of many Members regarding the number of Members on the House Floor at any one time,” Hoyer said. “No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi has privately dismissed the idea of voting outside of the Capitol in past meetings, as have House GOP leaders, though lawmakers and aides have acknowledged that the situation is fluid. Democratic leaders are expected to discuss the idea with their caucus on a conference call Thursday afternoon.  The push to allow remote voting has amplified in the last 12 hours, with two lawmakers — Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) — each testing positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  Nearly two dozen members have decided to self-quarantine after potential exposure to the virus, including several who had close contact with Diaz-Balart and McAdams on the floor or in various gatherings on Friday before the House left for recess. But even before the two lawmakers were diagnosed, there was growing anxiety among House members and staff about the inevitability of the virus spreading on Capitol Hill. Several staffers had already tested positive in both chambers. Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Van Taylor (R-Texas) led a bipartisan letter on Wednesday night calling for remote voting, with signatures from more than 50 members. “When it comes to social distancing and public health best practices, Congress should be an example, not an exception,” Porter wrote on Twitter.",House won't return until stimulus package is ready,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/congress-coronavirus-pandemic-137414,politico
"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the Canada-U.S. border will likely close to nonessential travel on Friday night to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking to reporters from his home in Ottawa this morning, Trudeau said the two governments “are continuing to work on the fine-tuning of the agreement between Canada and the United States,” but said it’s close to being finalized. Trudeau and President Donald Trump both announced Wednesday morning they were working on a mutual agreement to close the border to tourism and recreational travel. The border will stay open to trade, and Trudeau assured Canadians on Wednesday that deliveries of food, fuel and medicine would continue. Still, there remain unanswered questions about what else will be considered essential cross-border travel. The Canada-U.S. agreement will take effect less than 72 hours after Canada closed its borders to most international travelers, other than U.S. citizens. That measure came into effect on Wednesday at noon. Ottawa also says anyone trying to get on a plane to Canada who shows symptoms of the coronavirus will not be allowed to board. On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said all returning snowbirds — Canadians who overwinter in the U.S. — will be able to return to Canada. Canadian citizens who show up at a land border with coronavirus symptoms will be allowed into the country, but will be placed in quarantine.",Trudeau: Canada-U.S. border to close to nonessential travel on Friday night,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/canada-us-border-closing-coronavirus-137433,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged Thursday the U.S. faces months of economic contraction, but predicted a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent up demand” and return to “a normal world.”  In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he believes the economy will see its largest decline in this year’s second quarter, from April through June, followed by a third-quarter recovery as advancements in viral treatments and vaccines eventually halt the spread of the virus.  ""I think you’re going to see a lot of pent-up demand,"" Mnuchin told Maria Bartiromo. ""When we get through the next few months and Americans see what’s happening, and we have killed this virus, people are going to be comfortable going back to work.""  Mnuchin continued: ""We're going to be opening back business and people are going to continue what they do. They are going to live. They are going to shop. They are going to eat out. They are going to enjoy restaurants and travel and entertainment and we will go back to a normal world.”  Bartiromo pressed Mnuchin on company bailouts — a term he continues to push against. He emphasized Thursday that many of these companies will ultimately pay back any loans.  “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need.""  ""In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans. In the case of small businesses, if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them,"" he continued. ""I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.”  Mnuchin also clarified his reported warning to Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could spike to 20 percent if action is not taken. “What I said is that 40 percent of our workforce is in small business,"" he explained. ""And I said, if half of them were let go, mathematically, we’d be at 20 percent unemployment.”  Mnuchin’s upbeat outlook comes alongside grim new data emerging from the federal government. The Labor Department on Thursday reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week, a jump it attributed to the pandemic. It was the highest number of claims since September 2017, and economists expect that figure to soar in the coming weeks. Asked whether economic data should be ignored in this volatile environment, Mnuchin replied, “The statistics in the short run of economics are obviously not relevant. This is an unprecedented situation where, at the government’s direction, we shut down parts of the economy and now is the time that we provide government support.”",Mnuchin predicts ‘gigantic’ fourth quarter after coronavirus rebound,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/steven-mnuchin-predicts-economic-recovery-137214,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday morning, State is expected to issue a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information.  It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later.  ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.”  “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said.  Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens.Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Thousands of U.S. citizens are already stuck in limbo abroad, and the new guidance threatens to create further anxiety and confusion among travelers.  Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. Several current and former U.S. diplomats, some of them with several decades of experience, said they do not recall such a travel advisory ever being issued in the past. The highly unusual guidance is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, following President Donald Trump's move to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have closed their borders and imposed further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday.

"Just two weeks ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was on the Senate floor haranguing his Democratic counterpart, Chuck Schumer, over the New York senator’s allegedly “threatening” comments toward two Supreme Court justices. Just before that, McConnell and Schumer were locked in a month-long bitter struggle over President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. But as the United States confronts potentially devastating economic consequences from the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate leaders face a stiff challenge on whether they can come together to quickly finalize a massive economic stimulus package. Their ability to reach a bipartisan agreement will shape the crisis’ fallout for millions of Americans.  McConnell and Schumer’s relationship has repeatedly been strained throughout the Trump era, in particular as Congress faced down government shutdowns and fiscal deadlines under an unpredictable, populist president who will attack anyone he sees as a threat, even members of his own party. But both men like to make deals — and they’ve proven skilled at just that in recent years. “Schumer’s a deal maker and McConnell’s a deal maker — he holds his cards very close to the vest but he’s a deal maker,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who worked closely with McConnell on legislation to raise the tobacco purchase age to 21. After deferring to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the White House on the House’s multi-billion dollar “Phase 2” emergency coronavirus bill, McConnell is taking the lead on the so-called “Phase 3” effort. It’s a $1 trillion-plus stimulus package intended to cushion the expected blow to the U.S. economy as businesses shut down and entire industries see plummeting demand for their goods and services, by far the most expensive economic rescue effort for Congress since the Great Recession ended more than a decade ago. ""It is critical that we move swiftly and boldly to begin to stabilize our economy, preserve Americans' jobs, get money workers and families and keep up our fight on the health front,"" McConnell said Thursday. ""This is exactly, exactly what our proposal will do."" But McConnell knows any deal will have to be bipartisan — and will need support from at least seven Democrats, assuming his caucus is united, to move forward. That gives Schumer — who has been in lockstep with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the response to the crisis — leverage in the negotiations.  “This is a massive problem. It takes bold, strong, immediate action. And we'll have to stay at this for a while because there are so many different problems we have to deal with, but we can't be partisan,” Schumer said in a CNN interview Wednesday night. “We can’t be timid. It's got to be bold and strong and comprehensive. And we’re prepared to stay here and do that.” The two leaders have yet to speak about the Senate’s “Phase 3” stimulus package.  McConnell is seeking to first build a consensus among Senate Republicans — on everything from direct payments to loans — and then will bring his proposal to Schumer to iron out the details. Senators expect those talks to last well into the weekend, and McConnell is urging lawmakers to stay close by so that the Senate can quickly vote on and pass the aid package. “I’m about as conservative fiscally as you can find on Capitol Hill. But my approach to this is: I’m pretty much Mr. Senator whatever it takes, we’ve got to get the economy back standing so when the virus is contained and it will be contained we can have an economy to come back to,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. McConnell and Schumer have seen some ups and downs in their own relationship. In 2018, the pair made a rare joint appearance at the University of Louisville’s McConnell Center, where the two men were jovial and exchanged bottles of bourbon. They also clinched a two-year budget caps agreement last year. But relations soured during Trump's impeachment. There's also residual bitterness at McConnell from Democrats over his decision to block Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, and then use partisan muscle to push Trump picks Neil Gorscuh and Brett Kavanaugh onto the high court. Yet the McConnell-Schumer dynamic is nowhere near as toxic as relations got between McConnell and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). While Reid and McConnell both served on the Appropriations Committee and prided themselves on their legislative flexibility, their relationship completely fell apart by the time Reid retired in 2016. The bitterness between the two men carried over onto the Senate floor, paralyzing the chamber's work. So far, McConnell and Schumer are projecting confidence about their ability to work together again to stave off the unprecedented coronavirus crisis. “Both sides are going to be sufficiently motivated and we need to be bipartisan on this and I’m hoping that spirit of cooperation will really kick in,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).  “I think we always have — after 9/11, after 2008. We’ll do it again,” added Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a top adviser to McConnell. But the 2008 bailout of the U.S. financial services industry was a searing experience for both men. Schumer had ridden into the Senate Democratic leadership on his ability to raise money, especially from Wall Street. Schumer later received criticism from progressives over those corporate relationships. McConnell voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), as the 2008 Wall Street rescue bill was called, only to see the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — then run by Schumer — attack him over the issue during his reelection campaign that year. And McConnell — who is known for never forgetting anything — is running for reelection again this year. Even before confronting each other over the next emergency package, the two Senate leaders will have to get their own members in line. McConnell convinced his caucus this week to vote for the House-passed coronavirus “Phase 2” stimulus package, despite GOP objections over the paid sick leave provisions. In the end, the package passed on Wednesday 90-8. All the ‘no’ votes were Republicans. Republicans are expected to unveil their “Phase 3” proposal Thursday. Among the ideas that were under discussion at a GOP lunch Wednesday were direct payments to individual Americans who make less than a certain amount; the deferment of student loans for potentially three months; and provisions for small businesses.  Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are discussing giving small businesses forgivable loans, which would be administered by a bank, credit union or some other type of lender.  Meanwhile, Schumer has been speaking directly with Mnuchin, including twice on Wednesday. Schumer and Senate Democrats are proposing at least a $750 billion package to expand paid family leave, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. The proposal allocates $400 billion in emergency appropriations to support the health care system, child care and small businesses and $350 billion to social safety net programs.  Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday the third stimulus package the Senate will consider must include a much broader paid sick leave policy in order for it to pass. “We can’t just do any type of response that only protects large corporations and businesses and not strengthen the social safety net which is where people are going to be needing the most help,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) in an interview. Schumer has joined Pelosi in calling for “four corner” negotiations between the party leaders in both the House and Senate, but McConnell has expressed no desire so far to sit down with Pelosi.  Yet some House Democrats fear that McConnell will try to pick off enough Senate Democrats to reach the critical 60-vote threshold in that chamber, pass a bill, and then try to “jam” the House politically. Pelosi has announced that Democrats will draft their own “Phase 3” proposal to give them bargaining power in the Senate’s talks. The discussions come as coronavirus is finally hitting Congress. Two House lawmakers have contracted the virus and more than a dozen are in self-quarantine after having been exposed to colleagues or other individuals who tested positive.  McConnell has vowed to keep the Senate in session until he and Schumer can pass a bill. Some senators have called for remote voting, but so far, appear to be staying put. The two leaders hope to have a deal in place by as early as this weekend, if they can reach one.",Coronavirus response hinges on McConnell and Schumer,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/mcconnell-schumer-coronavirus-response-137345,politico
"The number of National Guardsmen called up to deal with the coronavirus response may double by the weekend, and a top general says they may help with local law enforcement. More than 2,000 Guardsmen have already been deployed in 27 states to respond to the pandemic, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel told reporters Thursday. After possibly doubling in days, the number could rise to tens of thousands as the crisis deepens, he said. “When there is a hurricane you can see it on a map, you have a sense of how hard the storm will hit and how long the storm will last,"" said Lengyel, who is chief of the National Guard Bureau. ""With Covid-19 it's like we have 54 separate hurricanes in every state, territory and the District of Columbia.” In their current state-level Title 32 status, the country's 450,000 Guardsmen can be deployed by their governor to transport medical supplies, help with drive-through testing, and assist local law enforcement with enforcing curfews and other tasks, Lengyel said. He advised against federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 — one of the options the administration is considering — because doing so means the states would lose some of those authorities. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal government is prohibited from using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement. This limitation does not apply to the National Guard when activated by a state's governor and operating under Title 32. Louisiana state officials deployed Guardsmen in this capacity in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When under state control, Guardsmen have ""additional authorities that can assist law enforcement and they maintain their direct command and control links within their states,"" Lengyel said. This ""makes it a faster, more rapid, more efficient response for the government and the state emergency response network to use them."" Lengyel said he does not currently see a ""demand signal"" to use National Guard forces in a law enforcement role, but that could soon change as the crisis deepens. ""Anything that the law enforcement capacity normally does, that could be augmented with National Guard troops,"" he said. The primary reason to federalize the National Guard would be in a ""World War III"" scenario where additional forces are needed rapidly to go to war ""with a major peer competitor,"" Lengyel explained. But in the case of the coronavirus, no such action is needed, which he said would cost ""billions and billions of dollars."" ""I think you can get everything you need more efficiently and more effectively if you leave them in a state status,"" Lengyel said. ""There is no need right now to have 450,000 Guardsmen on duty in any given state.""","National Guard call-ups may double by the weekend, chief says",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/national-guard-call-ups-coronavirus-137578,politico
"A decade of sharp cuts to state unemployment programs threatens to leave laid-off workers more vulnerable than during the Great Recession. With 10 states having reduced since the 2007-09 recession the maximum weeks employees can receive unemployment benefits, many state unemployment systems will be less generous to the unemployed than they were during that earlier downturn — even with the $1 billion boost that unemployment insurance is will receive in the legislative package signed by President Donald Trump. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, recipients can stop receiving unemployment benefits after 12 weeks, despite predictions from public health officials and economic experts that the economic aftereffects from the coronavirus pandemic could last much longer. Meanwhile, nearly half of U.S. states and jurisdictions are running dangerously low on unemployment cash, further limiting the amount of stimulus they can deliver to weather the economic fallout. “Unemployment insurance is about more than just giving somebody a check when they’re unemployed,"" said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. ""It’s a macroeconomic stabilizer.” The generosity of unemployment benefits varies greatly among states. Unemployed workers in South Carolina and Missouri may receive $1,500 less and $1,400 less, respectively, than they would have heading into the Great Recession, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report. Workers in Kansas could receive $2,000 less, and workers in North Carolina could lose $2,700. Congress’ coronavirus response package offers states some relief but do little to expand benefits, which are set at the state level. The bill, signed by Trump on Wednesday, gives $500 million to help states process the expected surge in unemployment claims, and another $500 million in administrative assistance grants to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment. This second $500 million is conditioned on states waiving work-search requirements, waiting periods and penalties for employers that lay off workers. But it isn't conditioned on states extending benefits for any particular length of time. Federal assistance to state unemployment systems accounts by law for half the number of weeks that states already offer. Consequently, the states that cover the fewest number of weeks would receive the least help from any increase. For example, a state that offers 20 weeks' unemployment benefits would get 10 extra weeks' federal funding, while a state that offers 26 weeks would get 13. “That is a further consequence of the cutbacks that have taken place in a number of states — it also cuts back on the amount of extra weeks you get in a recession,” said Chad Stone, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. After the Great Recession, businesses lobbied, often successfully, to limit state taxes to increase state reserves for unemployment insurance, which the recession had depleted. Many states did so by cutting benefits for recipients. An individual employer’s payment rate for state unemployment insurance is typically tied to how many workers the employer lays off, much like a motorist who sees his or her insurance go up after an accident. Cutting benefits was a way to replenish the trust fund while limiting tax increases on business. “At some point, it gets to be a level where employers come to policymakers and say, ‘Hey, this is crazy. I want to hire people but I can’t afford to, because the payroll tax I would have for that is so high,’” said Matt Weidinger, a researcher at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package denied unemployment assistance to states that cut benefits. But according to Weidinger, states found a loophole: They could receive the assistance if they maintained the same level of benefits but cut the number of weeks these benefits could be received. On the whole, experts agree that state trust funds are in better shape than before the last recession. An AEI report that Weidinger published this month shows aggregate state trust fund balances at 76 billion, 40 percent higher than in 2007. The majority of states maintain sufficient unemployment insurance reserves to weather a recession, according to Labor Department data. But there remain 22 states and jurisdictions — including populous states like California, New York, Texas and Illinois — that have dangerously low reserves. As the crisis worsens, states are beginning to act on their own. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday that even before Congress compels him to, he will waive his state’s one-week waiting period and suspend work-search requirements for recipients, in part to help workers suffering from a state closure of bars and restaurants. On Monday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expanded unemployment benefits from 20 to 26 weeks and said that it will cover those taking care of family members. “We’re very mindful of the economic hurt for individuals who will lose their jobs,” DeWine said Sunday. “Look, this is brutally tough. And my heart goes out to them.

In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday, State is expected to issue a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. President Donald Trump also said on Thursday that the military is trying to help a large group of Americans stranded in Peru. ""We have a group of young people in Peru, and we're working on taking care of that with the military,"" he said, though he said the efforts shouldn't be considered an ""evacuation."" But Americans are stuck abroad in a number of other countries, including Guatemala. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information. It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later. ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.” “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said. Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will self-quarantine for a week after shaking hands with Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart days before the Florida Republican developed coronaviruslike symptoms, the agency confirmed this morning. Steve Dickson and Diaz-Balart shook hands before an appropriations hearing on March 11. Diaz-Balart has said he developed a headache and fever the night of March 14. He and Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) are the first members of Congress to test positive for the coronavirus. When asked Wednesday night about Dickson's interaction with Diaz-Balart, FAA spokesperson Brianna Manzelli said Dickson was ""feeling fine.""

"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory, which appears to be unprecedented, would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Thousands of U.S. citizens are already stuck in limbo abroad, and the new guidance threatens to create further anxiety and confusion among travelers.  Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. Several current and former U.S. diplomats, some of them with several decades of experience, said they do not recall such a travel advisory ever being issued in the past. The highly unusual guidance is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, following President Donald Trump's move to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have closed their borders and imposed further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned.  “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO.

"A plunging stock market. Restaurants, gyms and movie theaters shutting their doors. Workers losing more income each day. It’s an unprecedented public crisis, and it’s also billions of dollars in state tax revenue that’s evaporating quickly — and scrambling the economic equation for governors and mayors across the nation. The cascading impacts of the novel coronavirus come just as governors, state lawmakers, mayors and city councils would normally be hammering out their budget plans for the coming year. But with no telling how long the coronavirus pandemic will shut down everyday life, a crystal ball may prove as effective as economic formulas for the fiscal year ahead. Governors of both parties are now calling on President Donald Trump and Congress to step in with billions in federal aid and reductions in red tape. They'd also be wise to dust off their playbooks from more than a decade ago when the Great Recession last caused revenues to nose-dive with little notice. Starting in the fall of 2008, California wrote and rewrote its budget three times in less than a year because projections quickly went into the dustbin within months of printing a new spending plan. Leaders in states across the nation are bracing for a similar year of drafting their documents in pencil, knowing that the situation will be hard to pin down until the world emerges from hibernation. Unlike the federal government, states and cities must balance their budgets each year. Some states, like California, may be better prepared to weather the storm, sitting on a surplus and $20 billion reserve fund built after lessons learned from the previous downturn. But others will have to figure out which programs to cut for the first time in years. Illinois, for instance, doesn’t even have a rainy day fund. That was on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s wish list for this year’s legislative session — which has now been put on hold. States such as New York are already talking about building contingencies into their spending plan. Trigger cuts — a well-worn tool during the last recession — are already entering the conversation. Washington, of course, can use its borrowing powers where states can't, as it did during the 2008-09 recession with a massive public works package intended to create jobs and buoy local economies. Congress and the Trump administration are now discussing a package of more than $1 trillion in stimulus, and state and local leaders have begun to press for emergency federal aid to support sectors from transportation to dining. “We’re going to need the federal government with us in a big way,” said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who expects states will ultimately need collective federal aid of $3 trillion to $4 trillion. “And I think everybody recognizes that — and I don’t mean just New Jersey. We’re going to need help. This is beyond any one state.” But Democrats in particular wonder if the Trump administration will be eager to increase funding to areas it previously slated for cuts, such as Medicaid and social service programs that would serve as a safety net for those hit hardest by coronavirus economic damage. POLITICO’s reporters in state capitals and major cities throughout the country are watching the budget and economic impact of the pandemic closely — here’s a look at what’s happening in several major states. Florida’s leaders are used to planning their budgets around hurricane-induced disasters and even oil spills. Coronavirus is different: Economists in the Republican-led Sunshine State say it’s difficult to forecast how hard the virus will hit the state’s tourism-dependent economy — the fourth biggest in the country — with theme parks and beaches now shuttered. The pandemic played a big-money role as the Legislature wrapped up its two-month legislative session last weekend — lawmakers scaled back planned tax cuts and boosted the state’s $3.9 billion cash reserves by $300 million to prepare for the coronavirus response. The state has set aside $50 million for bridge loans, and laid-off employees can apply for unemployment assistance. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who came to power as a close Trump ally, delivered a rebuke to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on March 17 after the secretary said the federal stimulus package should include rules to keep money from going to millionaires who don’t need it. DeSantis said federal red tape could delay aid for months. An early version of a House stimulus bill now scheduled to go before the Senate sought to distribute funds through the Social Security Administration. DeSantis said he told has told Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that the first federal stimulus bill should be packed with assistance for people who will be left jobless. It also should include more bridge loan money for small businesses facing closure, he said. The full picture of the coronavirus impact in Florida might not come into focus for some time. Lawmakers decided on $300 million in added reserves before Walt Disney Co. and NBCUniversal closed theme parks in Orlando and cities including Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach closed beaches that were packed with spring break revelers. (For context, $3 billion of the state’s forecasted $36.5 billion in general revenue this year was expected to come from tourism sales tax revenue.) Gov. Gavin Newsom insists his state is better prepared than most to deal with a downturn. California is working with a $222.2 billion budget and a record surplus and reserves. But the nation’s most populous state, which has the fifth largest economy in the world, is heavily dependent on tax revenue from wealthy earners and hence capital gains — making it particularly vulnerable to stock market swings. So expect a wild ride. Last week, the UCLA Anderson Forecast lowered its expectations for GDP growth and trade but stopped short of predicting a recession. By Monday, UCLA economists had changed their minds. Monday’s revised report said the U.S. economy has entered a recession expected to last until September, and that California will suffer more than most. California is expected to lose more than 280,000 payroll jobs by the first quarter of 2021, with more than a third of those in the leisure, hospitality, transportation and warehousing sectors, according to the report. State Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek, an influential voice on the state budget, said that “while the impact on state revenues is not yet clear, the extreme market volatility and rapidly weakening economic situation obviously have negative implications.” He issued a memo Wednesday projecting ""several billion dollars"" less in capital gains through mid-2021 and said the state would likely have to pass a stopgap budget before approving a full spending plan after its June 15 deadline. Still, Petek pointed to California's robust reserve fund as a buffer against potential budget cuts. Christopher Thornberg, founder of Beacon Economics in Los Angeles, is taking an optimistic approach. While this is unprecedented at a national level, he said, regions have bounced back from such natural disasters fairly quickly. It’s not necessarily like the 2008 financial crisis, which had a long-term impact on the economy and permanent loss of jobs, he said. “It’s business delayed, not business canceled. It’s spending delayed, not spending canceled,” Thornberg said. “If we’re looking at four weeks, it’s a hurricane. But to be clear, if this goes 40 weeks, California is not in a good position. … Our revenue system in the state is so hypersensitive to shifts in capital gains that if the stock market really did stay down where it is right now, we’re going to take a massive hit.” New York’s economy faces a massive hit: In a best-case scenario, tax revenues will likely be $4 billion lower than projected for the coming fiscal year, the state comptroller says, and New York City alone faces at least a $3.2 billion hit to its bottom line as travel dwindles and restaurants, bars and theaters close indefinitely, a steep loss in tax revenue that will extend for six months. Financing the massive coronavirus response, meanwhile, is going to upend Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s previously planned efforts to fill a major Medicaid budget hole. State leaders are scrambling to finish their state budget this week, but Cuomo said the original forecast is practically moot now with an expected economic downturn in weeks and months to come. The state was already staring down a roughly $6 billion budget gap, primarily due to a $4 billion Medicaid shortfall. Cuomo’s plan to address that relied on limiting the amount of local spending on Medicaid that is picked up by the state. But the second federal coronavirus bill — which would give the state billions of dollars — would make that strategy ""impossible,"" the governor complained over the weekend, because it contains language prohibiting any changes to localities' reimbursement rates. Sources close to the legislation say Cuomo is working with the New York delegation for language in additional federal coronavirus bills to allow him flexibility to move forward with his Medicaid savings plan. The state’s comptroller, Tom DiNapoli, has long suggested New York's reserves are not built up to withstand disaster or severe economic downturn. The budget Cuomo proposed would get the two largest statutory reserve funds to under $2.5 billion, about 3.1 percent of General Fund expenditures, and far below other large states such as California, Texas and Michigan. In the City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom since taking office in 2014; he’s expanded the city budget from $75 billion six years ago to a proposed $95.3 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. That streak has now ended this month, with a city economy dependent on tourism and entertainment grinding to a halt. As bad as the picture is now for the city, it still has room to get worse. De Blasio and Cuomo are looking at plans to potentially shut down roads, bridges, tunnels and trains to halt travel in and out of the city. That would drain city coffers further and could have ripple effects for national and global markets. Texas is used to booms and busts in the oil and gas sector blowing a hole in the state’s $110 billion annual budget. It’s got a rainy day fund that has more than $11 billion. “The ups and downs are nothing new for us,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park, which has a Shell manufacturing site. “It’s a normal part of the budgeting process. I’m not overly concerned.” But the oil and gas downturn is coming at the same time as the outbreak — meaning that state budget writers will have to make some tough decisions when they gather in Austin for the next session in January. An oil production tax provides 6.1 percent of the state’s revenue and natural gas production tax generates 2.7 percent. That, combined with an expected plunge in sales tax from shuttered restaurants, hotels and businesses and a lack of income tax, means Texas will have a tough time cushioning the blow. Typically, state budget writers have blunted oil price busts by drastically cutting services like education. But the state, which has the highest uninsured rate in the country, is lagging in its response to the outbreak, meaning that the virus spread could stretch thin hospitals and other services. Lawmakers will have to figure out where to get the money to help hospitals and providers while boosting health services. If Democrats take the majority in the state House this year, they will insist on not balancing the budget on the backs of low-income residents. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said that he expects the federal government to throw the state a financial lifeline — as it did after Hurricane Harvey. Illinois is particularly vulnerable budget-wise. Not only is its rainy day fund depleted, but the state a few years ago also passed a constitutional amendment that restricts the use of motor fuel fees and taxes for road construction and repair only. So Illinois has much less flexibility than other states in funneling money to a fund to respond to the impacts of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, which is grappling with a $30 billion unfunded pension debt, relies on tax revenues from conventions, tourism and hotel and restaurant activities. The city has already lost at least 20 conventions, with a combined 200,000 visitors, as a result of the 30-day ban on gatherings of 1,000 or more. (The governor has since put the ban at no more than 50 people.) “This is putting a severe dent in those industries. With Chicago being the economic engine of the state of Illinois, putting that engine in neutral while we’re navigating the social isolation necessary to combat the coronavirus puts state and local finances in a very precarious position,” said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government watchdog that is often called to testify and provide independent opinions about state and city finances. Msall said the situation is reminiscent of the economic impacts of the attacks of 9/11. “The difference is in 9/11, we knew we needed to secure against additional attacks and rebuild. Here, we don’t know when the virus will stop attacking or when it will be effectively limited — and when people can socialize again and when businesses can conduct normal operations, when entertainment, colleges, universities and schools can reopen.” In New Jersey, the economic fallout could quickly eat through the state’s $1.5 billion projected surplus, which amounts to just 3.8 percent of the state’s current $39.9 billion budget. The revenue estimates used to project the surplus made no assumptions about any economic downturn, let alone the coronavirus, and state officials don’t immediately plan to announce an updated forecast. Murphy, who has fought with fellow Democrats in the Legislature over his proposal to raise taxes on millionaires, suggested that some sort of revenue raise could be needed. Still, he said, the damage could be far more than New Jersey could handle on its own. Extending the state’s top tax rate to those earning from $1 million to $5 million would raise less than $500 million a year, based on those now-outdated projections. Murphy is working with the state's congressional delegation to lobby for federal aid in the form of block grants. In the short term, the Wall Street selloff could temper income tax losses when tax season rolls around in 2021, but a drop in dividends and, more importantly, mass layoffs are sure to suck hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars out of the state’s coffers. The state collects sales tax on all online sales, potentially stabilizing that major revenue source. State Senate President Steve Sweeney proposed on Saturday a two-month holiday from the state sales and payroll taxes and deferral of other taxes, including property taxes — a potential short-term hit to local governments. Murphy said the state may not be able to afford it. The Boston marathon may be postponed, but Massachusetts lawmakers maneuvered around questions of how coronavirus will impact the state budget early this week, calling the situation ""fluid."" Officials said instead they are focused on legislation to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, and closed the State House to visitors other than elected officials and staffers. Massachusetts hammers out its budget details over the course of the spring, but the state is used to having its budget come late into the summer. ""For right now, we are focusing on legislation related to Covid-19. That is our priority,"" Senate President Karen Spilka told reporters. ""This is a very fluid situation."" In the meantime, Gov. Charlie Baker signed into law a $15 million fund to help the state combat coronavirus; on Monday, he proposed a $10 million small business recovery loan fund for businesses affected by the outbreak. House Speaker Robert DeLeo echoed Spilka's comments about the budget, saying the virus is ""taking precedence over other issues."" Massachusetts has around $3 billion in its so-called rainy day fund, according to the independent Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

"Donald Trump’s cease-fire with the press was short lived. Days after calling news media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic “very fair” at a White House news briefing, the president on Thursday went back on the offensive, agreeing with a reporter from the right-wing outlet One America News Network that outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal were siding with Chinese government propaganda and joking that he wanted to remove 75 percent to 80 percent of the journalists in the briefing room in the name of social distancing.  The president lashed out in particular at one reporter who asked why the White House was so unprepared to implement widespread testing for the respiratory illness given Trump’s assertion earlier this week that he’d known all along the outbreak would morph into a pandemic. Trump replied that his administration was, in fact, prepared for the virus that he spent weeks dismissing as a minimal threat to Americans. “We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly,” Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker.  “I’ll tell you how prepared I was — I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was,"" he continued, pointing to the single step he has pointed to almost exclusively as evidence that his administration has adequately addressed coronavirus. ""In fact, it was your network — I believe they called me a racist because I did that. It was many of the people in the room, they called me racist and other words because I did that.”  And he used a question about whether Congress should implement some kind of social distancing measures to joke about such measures imposed on journalists in the White House briefing room. The White House recently said it would pool cameras and let fewer reporters into the room to allow an empty seat between individuals in the typically jam-packed space. “I know all of them. I don’t know if they’re sitting like you people are sitting,” Trump said about the several members of Congress who have now tested positive for coronavirus.  But pointing at the reporters in the room, Trump continued: “You’re actually sitting too close. We should probably get rid of another 75, 80 percent of you. I’ll have just two or three that I like in this room. I think that’s a great way of doing it. We figured a new way of doing it.”  “But you’re actually much too close. You two,” Trump said, circling the air in the direction of the briefing room's front row, “should leave immediately.” White House news briefings, once a daily occurrence, had gone all but extinct in the Trump administration until the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic. Briefings under past Trump press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders were particular points of contention as the president's spokespeople struggled at times to answer questions about the factual inaccuracies or odd rhetoric emanating from their boss. But daily briefings, lately anchored by the president, have returned in recent days amid the coronavirus outbreak. And until Thursday, the president had remained mostly cordial with the press as he and others at the briefing work to disseminate the administration's messaging on its coronavirus response. But during his extensive media criticisms on Friday, Trump claimed that he’d been tested for coronavirus only after a deluge of questions from the media, which followed Trump’s appearance in pictures with an aide to the Brazilian president who tested positive for the virus.  “I didn't have any symptoms and I got a test, but I got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy,” Trump told reporters Thursday, when asked about his conflicting messaging over whether people with no symptoms should seek out a test, which have been in short supply across the country. “My doctor told me don't get it, you don't need it,” Trump continued. “Everybody said you don't need it, but I had to do it because the press was going crazy. And then after I got it, they said you shouldn't have gotten it, you had no symptoms.”  Toward the end of the briefing, a correspondent for the Trump-friendly cable news outlet OAN gave the president a wider opening to go after the press, which he seized. ""It amazes me when I read the things I read,"" he began, rapping several newspapers for ""phony"" reporting on his handling of the crisis. When the reporter posited that ""major left wing news media"" had been ""siding with state propaganda"" emanating from China by criticizing his use of the term ""Chinese virus,"" Trump went on an extended riff about the ""corrupt media.""  ""I think they do — I mean, they're siding with China. They're doing things they shouldn't be doing. They're siding with many others. China is the least of it,"" Trump asserted. ""So why they're doing this, you'll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.""  Ironically, Trump singled out only The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal — three papers whose journalists China announced it would expel from the country earlier this week, a move that Trump's administration condemned.",Trump drops his coronavirus media detente,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-media-coronavirus-137692,politico
"AUSTIN, Texas — Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order limiting public gatherings to 10 people, shutting schools, prohibiting visitors to nursing homes and retirement communities and limiting bars and restaurants to take-out through April 3 in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. He also recommended that non-essential state employees telework.  The virus's quick spread is sparking a dramatic response from Republican state leaders, who until now had been letting local officials issue guidance on closures. About 140 Texans have tested positive for COVID-19 and three people have died since the first case on March 4.  “The traditional model that we have employed in the state of Texas for such a long time so effectively does not apply to an invisible disease that knows no geographic or jurisdictional boundaries,” Abbott, said at a press conference. The state issued a public health disaster order, the first such order since 1901, according Abbott. Abbott said he expects testing capacity to reach 15,000 to 20,000 tests per week. So far, about 2,000 people have been tested in the state. And he said that hospitals are prepared for a potential surge in critically-ill patients, but didn't say whether the state is requesting military hospitals from the federal government.

"Pressure is building on the Trump administration to delay this year’s tax filing deadline, with Democratic and Republican lawmakers joining business groups in demanding that step in response to the coronavirus. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Thursday urging him to push the deadline to July 15. And a trio of senators introduced legislation that would do the same. The move would harmonize the filing deadline with the three-month grace period for tax payments that Mnuchin announced Tuesday. In his letter to Mnuchin, Neal said that having separate deadlines for filing and paying “will potentially create a great deal of confusion for taxpayers accustomed to having only one deadline.” He also cited the closure of some IRS assistance centers across the country. In introducing their legislation, Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Angus King (I-Maine) said a filing extension also would ensure that taxpayers don’t have to violate CDC social distancing guidelines, since they may have to meet with an accountant or need to physically retrieve documents to file by April 15. People could still file their taxes before July 15 if they choose to, so their refunds wouldn't be delayed, the senators said in a news release. “Treasury’s decision to extend the tax payment deadline from April 15 to July 15 was an important first step, but it only makes sense to also extend the tax filing deadline itself,” Thune, who is Senate majority whip, said. “There’s enough confusion amid this outbreak as it is, so I believe it’s incumbent upon Congress to provide as much clarity and relief as possible to American families."" In recent days, numerous business groups and organizations representing tax preparers have called on the administration to push back the filing deadline. Businesses have also sought an array of other measures to ease their tax burden during the health crisis. Neal also asked Mnuchin to delay payment of estimated taxes for the second quarter of 2020, noting they would otherwise be due June 15.",Lawmakers want delay in tax filing deadline amid coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/tax-filing-deadline-delay-coronavirus-137696,politico
"The Senate is inching closer to negotiating a third, trillion-dollar stimulus package to confront the coronavirus pandemic.  Senate Republicans are expected to unveil their proposal Thursday to deal with the crisis, after days of preliminary discussion. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed the Senate will stay in until a bipartisan deal is reached.  McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor Thursday, outlined the Republican proposal to assist small businesses by providing federally guaranteed loans; direct cash payments, as well as lending to industries such as the airlines that are hit hard by the coronavirus. In addition, Republicans are looking to get more resources for the health care system, which could be overloaded as the virus continues to spread throughout the U.S. “Our proposal will immediately help American workers, families, and businesses,” McConnell said of the plan, known as “Phase 3.” “Yes, it will help position our economy to thrive once again after this public health menace is behind us … Fundamentally, we have to beat back this virus.” Senate Republicans are expected to discuss the stimulus package at their lunch Thursday. But the package will need support from at least seven Senate Democrats if all Republicans back it. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) emphasized Thursday that Democrats, who have outlined their own vision, will pursue a “workers first” proposal and called for a “Marshall Plan” for the health care system. He also called for a new form of unemployment insurance.  Schumer has stayed in close touch with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the Trump administration, about the third stimulus package, as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).  In his floor remarks, Schumer also expressed skepticism about the administration’s proposal to provide $1,000 checks to workers to mitigate the economic consequences of the crisis, saying that “it cannot be a substitute” for other provisions like paid sick leave. He added that if Congress moves ahead with cash payments, the payments should be more substantial and frequent.  The Treasury Department floated a plan this week to lawmakers to provide direct payments to Americans starting in April, and then another round of payments in May.  “As we Democrats seek input into the joint bipartisan package that will be put together, our goal is to make sure that no one, no worker, no family, no one loses a paycheck or goes into financial ruin as a result of the coronavirus,” Schumer said. “That will take strong, bold, immediate action.” The minority leader also called for “four corner” negotiations between party leaders in the Senate and the House, but McConnell has shown no interest in involving the House. In preparing the “Phase 3” package, McConnell has directed task forces to come up with proposals. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are suggesting giving small businesses forgivable loans, which would be administered by a bank, credit union or some other type of lender.  According to a draft discussion of the small business proposal, obtained by POLITICO, the maximum small business loan the government could back would double to 10 million from 5 million through the end of the year. In addition, Republicans have discussed providing direct cash payments for individuals below a certain income level and the deferment of student loans, potentially for up to three months.  McConnell emphasized Thursday that the proposals are not “bailouts.”  “From small businesses to key sectors, we are not talking about so-called ‘bailouts’ for firms that made reckless decisions,” McConnell said. “Nobody is alleging a moral hazard here. None of these firms — not corner stores, not pizza parlors, not airlines — brought this on themselves.” Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have outlined their ideas for expanded paid sick leave and unemployment insurance as part of a $750 billion proposal.  The third stimulus package comes after the Senate passed Wednesday a multibillion dollar House-passed emergency aid package. While some Republicans had expressed reservations about the package's paid sick leave provisions, the final vote tally was 90-8.",Senate to begin negotiating third massive coronavirus package,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/senate-negotiates-third-coronavirus-package-137607,politico
"President Donald Trump on Thursday put the onus on governors to obtain the critical equipment their states need to fight the coronavirus pandemic, telling reporters that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk” for the potentially life-saving supplies. Appearing at the daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force, the president defended his decision to invoke the Defense Production Act — which would allow the administration to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of emergency medical provisions — without actually triggering the statute. “Governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work, and they are doing a lot of this work,” Trump said. “The Federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we're not a shipping clerk.” The president’s remarks amounted to a rebuke of governors’ recent pleas for more robust federal intervention amid the rapidly spreading outbreak, which they warn will soon overwhelm local health care systems if hospital beds, face masks and other necessities are not soon furnished in significantly greater numbers. Trump said Thursday the administration will “help out wherever we can,” but added that the acquisition of urgent supplies “is really for the local governments, governors and people in the state, depending on the way they divide it up. And they'll do that, and they're doing a very good job of it.” But earlier Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., exhorted the administration to help meet the demand for equipment. Cuomo has specifically sounded the alarm over the lack of ventilators in states across the nation, warning that New York would require five or six times its current supply of the respiratory machines to treat the projected number of coronavirus patients.  “Every state is shopping for ventilators. We‘re shopping for ventilators. We literally have people in China shopping for ventilators, which is one of the largest manufacturers. So this is a major problem,” Cuomo said at his daily news conference, adding that the administration “can actually play a very constructive role“ under the DPA. “We're going to need protective equipment in hospitals,” Cuomo said. “We‘re going to need ventilators. And that is something that a state can‘t do but the federal government can do.” Trump announced on Wednesday that he would dispatch one of the Navy’s two hospital ships to New York Harbor, while the other prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast. The vessels are equipped with 1,000 hospital beds each and are intended to relieve civilian hospitals struggling with capacity in the face of the public health crisis. The Pentagon has also took a variety of actions this week, including putting on alert 1,000 “deployable” beds from a variety of different medical units, making available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves, and distributing up to 2,000 ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday called for construction companies to donate their inventories of N95 protective masks to local hospitals and halt new mask orders, and said on Thursday that the administration had “literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators that can be converted to treat patients.“ He did not say where the ventilators were found.  Despite those measures, the Trump administration has not completed a comprehensive assessment to determine the full scope of supplies that will need to be ordered, according to current and former administration officials, and his invoking the DPA does not do anything to increase production of those items. Public health experts, meanwhile, have encouraged increased coordinaton between the administration and manufacturers assembling medical equipment for health care providers. “They need to receive assurances from the federal government that they will be compensated, even if health care institutions don‘t end up needing the equipment,“ Tom Inglesby and Anita Cicero, both of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, wrote in an op-ed earlier this month. Following the White House briefing, the president traveled to FEMA headquarters in Washington to participate in a video teleconference with governors on COVID-19 response efforts. In a memo from the National Governors Association delivered to Trump and Pence ahead of the call, the states‘ chief executives outlined their “top needs and priorities to be shared“ with the administration. Among their list of major concerns, the governors requested that the federal government “increase access to [personal protective equipment], masks, test kits, [and] extraction kits,“ and demanded “accelerating the production of life-saving equipment, such as ventilators.“ They also asked for the administration to “provide guidance on [the] implementation of“ the DPA.

"The number of National Guardsmen called up to deal with the coronavirus response may double by the weekend, and a top general says they may help with local law enforcement. More than 2,000 Guardsmen have already been deployed in 27 states to respond to the pandemic, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel told reporters Thursday. After possibly doubling in days, the number could rise to tens of thousands as the crisis deepens, he said. “When there is a hurricane you can see it on a map, you have a sense of how hard the storm will hit and how long the storm will last,"" said Lengyel, who is chief of the National Guard Bureau. ""With Covid-19, it's like we have 54 separate hurricanes in every state, territory and the District of Columbia.” In their current state-level Title 32 status, the country's 450,000 Guardsmen can be deployed by their governor to transport medical supplies, help with drive-through testing, and assist local law enforcement with enforcing curfews and other tasks, Lengyel said. He advised against federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 — one of the options the administration had been considering — because doing so means the states would lose some of those authorities. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal government is prohibited from using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement. This limitation does not apply to the National Guard when activated by a state's governor and operating under Title 32. Louisiana state officials deployed Guardsmen in this capacity in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When under state control, Guardsmen have ""additional authorities that can assist law enforcement and they maintain their direct command and control links within their states,"" Lengyel said. This ""makes it a faster, more rapid, more efficient response for the government and the state emergency response network to use them."" Hours after Lengyel spoke, Pentagon spokesperson Alyssa Farah announced that the administration plans to keep Guard troops under state control. ""The @DeptOfDefense is not considering federalization of the @USNationalGuard,"" she tweeted. ""The #COVID19 response is dynamic, but at this time Governors remain in control of their states’ National Guard forces & can request additional assistance from federal Title 10 forces through@FEMAgov."" The primary reason to federalize the National Guard would be in a ""World War III"" scenario where additional forces are needed rapidly to go to war ""with a major peer competitor,"" Lengyel explained. But in the case of the coronavirus, no such action is needed, which he said would cost ""billions and billions of dollars.""  ""I think you can get everything you need more efficiently and more effectively if you leave them in a state status,"" Lengyel said. ""There is no need right now to have 450,000 Guardsmen on duty in any given state.""","National Guard call-ups may double by the weekend, chief says",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/national-guard-call-ups-coronavirus-137578,politico
"As Congress drafts one of the biggest pieces of legislation in a generation, leaders in the House and Senate face mounting questions about how to keep members safe from the highly infectious coronavirus — including whether to vote away from the U.S. Capitol.  With two lawmakers now testing positive for the virus, Democratic and Republican leaders are eager to reassure their own members who warn that the situation could drastically worsen if roughly 435 of them are forced to be in a single room.  But congressional leaders also acknowledge that allowing members to vote remotely would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history — not to mention a massive and complicated undertaking that would take time to develop.   So far, the Senate has remained in Washington, even as the nation inches closer to a national lockdown, as GOP leaders scramble to complete a $1 trillion stimulus package in the coming days. The House, which has already recessed for the week, won’t return until that bill is ready for a vote, Democratic leaders announced Thursday.  But the rapidly worsening outbreak has heightened anxieties in both parties, with a growing number of lawmakers urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take drastic measures, including electronic voting outside the Capitol for the first time in history in a bid to halt the spread and shield themselves, their staffs and their families.  It’s an unlikely idea that past leaders have also entertained during times of national crises, including after the Sept. 11 attacks, only to dismiss it out of concern that it could erode the institution or signal a lack of confidence in the nation’s governing body.   “Boy, if we did, I would want it very, very limited,” Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Senate’s longest-serving Democrat, said Wednesday. The Vermont Democrat added that the idea came up in the Senate Democrats’ conference call earlier that day.  The issue is also expected to come up in conversations among House Democrats and Republicans on Thursday, as the two hold separate conference calls to update their members on the state of the Senate’s legislation and their own voting practices. House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern told members during a conference call on Thursday that he would review options on remote voting, according to people familiar with the conversation.  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said during the call that the House could clear the massive stimulus package with unanimous consent — which would prevent lawmakers from needing to be in the building — but said it was ""unlikely.""  “I share the concerns of many members regarding the number of members on the House Floor at any one time,” Hoyer said in a letter to House Democrats on Thursday, announcing that they wouldn’t need to return to Washington until it was time to vote on the next tranche of emergency aid.  Hoyer told members that he will be “adjusting” the House schedule to require less time at the Capitol and halt the virus’ spread among lawmakers. But the Maryland Democrat did not address the possibility of allowing members to vote remotely from their districts, an idea that has steadily gained traction, particularly among West Coast lawmakers, amid the rapidly intensifying outbreak.  “No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options,” Hoyer said.   Hoyer confirmed that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point.  Pelosi has privately rejected the idea of voting outside of the Capitol in past meetings, as have House GOP leaders, though lawmakers and aides have acknowledged that the situation is fluid. There are both security and logistical concerns about enacting a remote voting plan, which would fundamentally alter the institution.  The thinking among GOP leadership is that the House would also need to come up with legislation specifically on remote voting, which would redirect energy that lawmakers want to spend on the stimulus bill, according to a GOP aide.  Democratic leaders are expected to discuss the idea with their caucus on a conference call Thursday afternoon. And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) directed his GOP committee leaders to take the temperature of their members on the issue, among other things, and will also host a conference-wide call Thursday to discuss it further.  The push to allow remote voting has amplified in the last 12 hours, with two lawmakers — Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) — each testing positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  And it’s created a domino effect in the halls of Congress: Nearly two dozen members have decided to self-quarantine after potential exposure to the virus, including several who had close contact with Diaz-Balart and McAdams on the floor or in various gatherings on Friday before the House left for recess. Even the head of the Federal Aviation Administration had to go on lockdown after interacting with Diaz-Balart. The House physician’s office had been aggressive in tracking down potential contacts, compiling a list of people who were in close proximity and asking questions like whether they shook hands. From that list, the physician’s office then called each person individually to ask more questions, and further trace any interactions.   Lawmakers and staff were told to isolate themselves if they’d been in close quarters with either McAdams or Diaz-Balart, and any relevant offices were disinfected immediately.  For McAdams, who developed symptoms on Saturday night, all contacts were traced back to Thursday night. The Utah Democrat had been in contact with more than a dozen lawmakers and staff members on Friday night, socializing in one member’s office as the chamber awaited a vote in the House that wasn’t called until after midnight.  Diaz-Balart, meanwhile, was one of several deputy whips who participated in a 90-minute meeting in House Minority Whip Steve Scalise’s office on Friday, where they joined in on a Republican conference call and then watched Trump’s press conference on TV. Now, the core of the GOP whip’s team – including Scalise — will be sidelined in self-isolation until March 27.  But the hope among leadership is that the next stimulus package will be so bipartisan that their vote-counting operation — and even the House Rules Committee — won’t be as necessary as it would under normal circumstances. There’s also been discussions about “pre-whipping” legislation, according to Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.), one of the deputy whips who has been forced to self-quarantine.  “I very much want to vote on the next bill, but if they have to move ahead because it’s an emergency, I understand,” said Cole, who is also the top Republican on the House Rules Committee.   “So far, we haven’t lost many members [on coronavirus bills] and votes haven’t been so close,” he added, before acknowledging: “but they could be.”  One scenario floated by GOP lawmakers and aides: if they can pass legislation by unanimous consent — or if quarantined members have to miss the roll call vote — they can just formally enter into the record how they would have voted on the bill.  Even before the two lawmakers were diagnosed, there was growing anxiety among House members and staff about the inevitability of the virus spreading on Capitol Hill. Several staffers had already tested positive in both chambers. And while congressional leaders are taking steps to limit physical interactions during votes and meetings, the very nature of the job makes it nearly impossible for members to socially distance themselves. Everything from elevator buttons to the Capitol’s underground trains could become a hotbed for the virus.  The stress about potential infections in the Capitol complex has been compounded by the gravity of the legislative challenge ahead: a $1 trillion package being drafted in mere days with the entire economy hinging on the result.  “The mood is very very somber,” one senior Democratic aide said. “I think we realize we’re staring down one of the worst public health crises we’ve ever faced, and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.”  Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Van Taylor (R-Texas) led a bipartisan letter on Wednesday night calling for remote voting, with signatures from more than 50 members.  “When it comes to social distancing and public health best practices, Congress should be an example, not an exception,” Porter wrote on Twitter.  The idea of remote voting has also drawn attention in the Senate, despite McConnell dismissing the suggestion earlier in the week. As concerns grow across the Capitol about the rapid spread of the deadly virus — which is especially harmful to the elderly — more senators raised the possibility Thursday.   “I think it's important if we're talking about weeks or months,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said when asked about the possibility of the Senate working remotely. “We probably cannot keep operating all in one location.""  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), was looking at the possibility of allowing senators to vote via telephone in the case of a national emergency.   “Don't want to make the Senate telephonic, where you call in your vote. That would not be what the Senate's all about,” Schumer told NPR. “But during this emergency, we would allow that. We're looking at allowing that to happen. We think it's constitutionally allowed.""  Separately, Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced a bill Thursday that would allow Senate leaders to institute remote voting for up to 30 days during a national crisis.   Some more senior senators, however, have dismissed the idea. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters on Wednesday: ""It is my understanding that there will not be remote voting.""  Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have opted for conference calls. And at least one member, Sen. Sherrod Brown, has decided to drive himself to Washington, instead of taking a plane. Senate Republicans are continuing to ignore advice from the CDC — and even Trump — and met in person for lunch Thursday.  McConnell is moving swiftly to pass a third phase of Congress’ response to the coronavirus — a trillion-dollar stimulus package with billions of dollars directed toward massive industries and small businesses and direct cash payments for Americans impacted by the virus.   “We’re not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions...none of these firms — not corner stores, not pizza parlors, not airlines — brought this on themselves,” McConnell said Thursday. “We’re talking about loans which must be repaid.”  The Kentucky Republican is expected to introduce text of the GOP proposal later Thursday and then begin negotiations with Schumer.   House Democrats, meanwhile, are working on a counter-proposal, hoping to use that as a bargaining chip in discussions with the Senate. Schumer and Pelosi have repeatedly called for “four corner” negotiations between them, McConnell and McCarthy on the third stimulus package, an idea McConnell has dismissed.   McConnell has said the Senate would not leave until it passes the “Phase 3” legislation. But on the floor Thursday, the GOP leader said that wouldn’t be the last action Congress takes to address the coronavirus pandemic.   The administration has already asked for another $48 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the crisis — a request McConnell said his chamber would immediately begin work on after moving the “phase 3” bill.   “Immediately after we pass this legislation, Congress must begin a bipartisan, bicameral appropriations process to address the administration’s new supplemental funding request,” McConnell said on the floor.   “We have to beat back this virus.”",Anxiety grows in Capitol as lawmakers weigh remote voting,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/congress-coronavirus-pandemic-137414,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday, State is expected to issue a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. President Donald Trump also said on Thursday that the military is trying to help a large group of Americans stranded in Peru. ""We have a group of young people in Peru, and we're working on taking care of that with the military,"" he said, though he said the efforts shouldn't be considered an ""evacuation."" But Americans are stuck abroad in a number of other countries, including Guatemala. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information. It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” Another woman stranded in Guatemala who said she is pregnant and in need of medical attention got an email from the embassy earlier on Thursday asking for more information, including medical proof and length of her pregnancy. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said that she was sold a plane ticket by Colombian airline Avianca, went to the airport and found it was closed. Avianca is now not answering her calls. A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later. ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.” “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said. Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Civil War effectively ended at Appomattox, Va. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he declared a national emergency to help combat the pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together,because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command and control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy hospital ships to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to deploy the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a green light for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and other administration officials who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely because the Comfort is undergoing maintenance that could take weeks. The Mercy, homeported in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. While Pentagon officials have been meeting regularly on the virus pandemic for six weeks, major contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon for enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with police to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated National Guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients, and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing, “There is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said, “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the respiratory syndrome, which can be deadly. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander in chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"Senate Republicans raced this week to introduce a trillion-dollar coronavirus stimulus package. Lobbyists for industries left reeling by the pandemic were hustling just as hard to shape it. The bill’s unveiling on Thursday capped an extraordinary week on K Street in which trade group after trade group asked Congress for sums that would have been unfathomable just a few weeks ago: $1.4 trillion to shore up the manufacturing sector, $4 billion for museums, $100 billion for doctors, nurses and hospitals. The Senate’s breakneck work to craft relief legislation this week has driven a frantic effort from industries crippled by measures taken to slow the spread of the virus as well those who have suffered less harm.  Not everyone got what they wanted in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s bill. But it wasn’t for lack of trying. “The Hill appears to be overwhelmed with people advocating for why they’re uniquely affected by the coronavirus epidemic,” said Sean Kennedy, the top lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association, which asked Congress for more than $300 million in relief this week. The restaurant association has mobilized its members to make tens of thousands of phone calls to their lawmakers. With many restaurants shuttered to slow the virus’ spread, their proprietors have had plenty of free time to become armchair lobbyists, Kennedy said. Other lobbyists have pleaded their clients’ cases to a handful of aides to top Republican senators, such as Erica Suares in McConnell’s office and Nick Rossi, who’s chief of staff to Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican. Some lobbyists for industries hit hard by the restrictions imposed by coronavirus were underwhelmed by what they got in McConnell’s bill: $58 billion in loans and loan guarantees for the airlines and another $150 billion for other “severely distressed sectors” of the economy, as well as nearly $300 billion in loans for small businesses. “We think it will be insufficient to stem the tide of job loss and closing of hotels that we’re seeing, candidly,” said Brian Crawford, the top lobbyist for the American Hotel & Lodging Association. “We’re hoping this is an opening salvo.” “It needs to be bigger,” said Tori Barnes, the top lobbyist for the U.S. Travel Association, even though she praised of the measures it includes. The hotel and travel industries personally pleaded their cases to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, warning that the industry could shed millions of jobs in the coming weeks without significant help. The hotels asked for $150 billion in grants, along another $100 billion for the broader travel industry. McConnell’s bill would force hotels and the travel industry to compete with restaurants, casinos, distillers, moving companies and manufacturers — all of which have asked for aid this week — for $150 billion in loans. The legislation will need the support of Senate Democrats to pass, giving lobbyists for industries that feel they’ve gotten short shrift another chance to shape the bill before senators leave town in the coming days. Not every industry lost out in McConnell’s bill. The airlines, which asked for $59 billion in cash, loans and loan guarantees, got $58 billion in loans. Nick Calio, the head of Airlines for America, the industry’s trade group, said the money will keep the airlines going for five to six more months. “We have been hit the hardest of anyone by this,” he said in an interview. The National Retail Federation, meanwhile, secured a tweak to the Republican tax law that it had been pressing for since shortly after its passage in 2017. The fix would return an estimated $15 to $30 billion to hotels, restaurants and retailers that have upgraded their properties over the past two years but haven’t gotten a tax break for it, according to the trade group. David French, the National Retail Federation’s top lobbyist, said it was harder to lobby for the provision because he couldn’t meet with senators or their staffers in person, with the Hill mostly closed to visitors.  “It’s working, but it’s certainly not like in the old days,” he said. Lobbyists’ inability to meet with lawmakers and administration officials face to face hasn’t stopped them from trying to cash in on their connections. “Have you adjusted your consultant strategy and team lineup in light of the new Corona virus realities?” the lobbyist Terry Allen wrote in an email to potential clients on Thursday morning. “Fidelis Government Relations now has best in class reach into both VP Mike Pence and incoming White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.” The lobbying shop boasts the services of Pence’s former chief of staff, Bill Smith, as well as Wayne King, a former aide to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), whom Trump tapped earlier this month to become his next White House chief of staff, Allen wrote in the email, which was obtained by POLITICO. Pence is “quarterbacking the government's response to the Corona virus,” he added. In an interview, Allen said he’d already gotten a call from a potential client in response to the email. While the pitch emphasized the government’s coronavirus response, Allen said the pandemic wasn’t the focus of the firm’s lobbying efforts. “Regardless of whether the coronavirus is prominent, our lineup is strong,” he said.",Lobbyists make a mad dash to shape coronavirus stimulus package,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/lobbyists-coronavirus-stimulus-package-138519,politico
"The Department of Veterans Affairs is preparing to deploy 3,000 doctors, nurses and other emergency personnel — along with mobile hospitals and pharmacies — to bolster the nationwide effort to combat the coronavirus, Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie told POLITICO on Thursday. The VA, which runs 170 veterans hospitals and 135 community living centers around the country, is designated as the backup health system to the military in the event of war. But it is also authorized to assist in natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or in this case, a pandemic. The VA is ""preparing for a national call on this matter,"" Wilkie said in a telephone interview, likening the personnel to military reservists who can be called up by the president at any time. ""They know that they can be deployed anywhere in the country. Just like the reserves, their physicals are up to date, their shots are up to date. That prepares them to launch when called upon."" Asked if he has any timeline on when they might be needed, Wilkie said, ""we haven't come to that point yet."" But he said the agency is gaming out where they might be most needed. For example, ""city X has this happen, what is the request from the governor, and how do you respond to that governor's request that comes through,"" Wilkie said. One of the main purposes of the National Disaster Medical System, as it is known, is ""to assist state and local authorities in responding to medical and public health effects of major disasters and emergencies,"" according to the VA. This crisis poses numerous challenges, including the fact that some of the VA's emergency medical personnel are likely already treating patients with the virus — and the number of cases on veterans hospitals are expected to grow. That is a double-edged sword because it means some already have experience with the outbreak but they also might be needed where they are. ""They've been responding to natural disasters, so that's their forte,"" Wilkie said. ""But they're also working in hospitals now where they're dealing with this virus."" The emergency cadre includes ""doctors, nurses, psychologists, engineers, nutritionists, police,"" Wilkie said. ""In addition to that, we are able to provide a mobile hospital. We're able to provide command posts. We're able to provide nutrition centers, medical vans, mobile pharmacies to support those needs."" Beyond providing additional medical personnel, if necessary the VA health system could also make available extra hospital capacity. ""If the president so chooses,"" Wilkie said, ""we would augment civilian capabilities when it comes to medical space available."" In the meantime, the VA is trying to minimize the spread of the virus in its own medical facilities, including barring family visits, reducing routine appointments, and delaying dental and elective surgeries. The steps are all designed to cut down on social interaction but also free up resources for what is expected to be an increase of the virus among veterans. ""We were the first system in the country to start triaging people before they even entered,"" Wilkie said. Barring visitors for elderly veterans ""is a terrible thing because the majority of those 7,800 who are in those living centers come from World War II and Korea. And we had to make the painful choice in order to protect them,"" Wilkie said. So far, Wilkie reports that 85 veterans ""we know of"" have the virus. Of those, 50 are recuperating at home. ""They didn't need to be admitted to our hospitals,"" he said. But he said ""we expect a lot more"" veterans suffering from the coronavirus. ""We'll see a jump in the next few days, as the rest of the country.""","VA secretary: VA preparing to deploy 3,000 medical personnel for virus response",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/veterans-affairs-coronavirus-138513,politico

"The $1 trillion proposal Senate Republicans unveiled Thursday night represents one of the most dramatic bailouts in American history, picking winners and losers during one of the worst economic crises in decades. Airlines, financial markets, small businesses and hospitals would all get a boost under the nearly 250-page bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rolled out less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump signed a second multibillion-dollar coronavirus response measure. Individual taxpayers and families would get checks of up to $1,200 or $2,400, depending on income. Senate Democrats have introduced their own $750 billion proposal, and House Democrats are working to craft their version of a massive measure to shore up the economy, stressing that the package should include tens of billions of dollars in additional emergency money for federal agencies, as well as state and local governments. Here's who would benefit from the Senate GOP plan: The bill would provide the battered industry with $58 billion in loans and loan guarantees, plus a holiday from paying fuel tax. Passenger air carriers could borrow up to a total of $50 billion, and cargo air carriers would get up to $8 billion. Those loans would come with some strings, including limits on compensation for executives. But Democrats had sought additional restrictions, like rules against stock buybacks. While the total should satisfy airlines, the industry had wanted half to be grants, rather than loans. A pot of $300 billion would be devoted to pumping cash to small businesses in the form of “loans” employers wouldn’t have to pay back as long as they maintain their payrolls during the emergency. Those rules would be retroactive to March 1, to entice employers to rehire workers who have already been laid off this month. While no business could receive more than $10 million, the size of each loan would be calculated based on a business’ average expenses from last year, including payroll, mortgage payments and debt obligations. Small businesses would also be allowed to use existing SBA loans for costs that aren’t usually covered, like paid sick leave, salaries, mortgage payments and supply chain disruptions. The maximum amount a business could get in so-called “express loans” would increase from $350,000 to $1 million. Hospitals bracing for a wave of coronavirus cases in the coming weeks would get some temporary relief from Medicare cuts that have shrunk payments by 2 percent under the safety net program that covers health care costs for older Americans. Providers would also get a 15 percent Medicare payment bump for coronavirus patients. The provisions would likely send billions of dollars to hospitals, although they fall far short of the $100 billion the industry is demanding. Besides a boost for hospitals, the measure Republicans have pitched would help prop up the rest of the U.S. health care system as the virus rages, including sending more than $1.3 billion to community health centers, allowing labs to develop emergency tests and forcing insurers to cover vaccines. The measure would fix a mistake in the 2017 tax law that keeps restaurants, hotels and stores from immediately writing off certain renovation costs. The National Retail Federation estimates the change would return up to $15 billion a year to the three industries, which are among the hardest hit as people stay home because of the coronavirus and officials curtail or shutter those businesses altogether. Most American adults would get checks of up to $1,200, plus $500 for every child. But people who made more than $99,000 in 2018 would get zilch, as well as couples who file joint tax returns and make a total of more than $198,000 a year. As businesses clamor for liquidity amid mounting layoffs and decreased demand for services, the Senate bill would free up cash through a host of tax relief provisions. Social Security taxes would be on pause for employers for the rest of the year, but they would have to pay back that money in 2021 and 2022. Employers could apply recent operating losses to previous tax years, get quicker refunds and deduct more from the interest paid on their debt. Faster reimbursements would go out to business owners forced to give workers paid time off during the outbreak. Instead of making employers wait to receive tax credits, they would be able to deduct anticipated credits from their normal filings or get a direct credit in advance. The bill provides some relief for students receiving financial aid. Students would not have to repay their student loans or Pell Grants if they drop out in the middle of the semester because of the coronavirus. Colleges would also be allowed to continue to pay students under the Federal Work-Study program if they are unable to work because their employer closed due to the outbreak. Federal student loan payments, including interest, would automatically be suspended for at least three months. The bill would also give Education Secretary Betsy DeVos the power to defer payments for an additional three months beyond that. The suspended payments would still count as payments for borrowers on track for loan forgiveness under federal programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Companies that were required to pay a one-time tax on profits they brought home under the 2017 tax overhaul will be able to recover tax over-payments. Allowing companies to recover that money will help them deal with one of the biggest problems of the crisis: Maintaining liquidity. The Treasury Department would be temporarily allowed to guarantee money market mutual funds, which are critical instruments for short-term financing. The measure would revive an authority Treasury last used during the 2008 Wall Street meltdown to stop runs on the funds. Toby Eckert, Michael Stratford, Kathryn A. Wolfe, Bernie Becker, Tanya Snyder, Zachary Warmbrodt and Susannah Luthi contributed to this report.

"Hospitals bracing for a flood of coronavirus cases are demanding a federal bailout.  They want $100 billion in the next relief package along with targeted changes to tax laws they say are needed to free up the money before the first surge of cases sweeps in. Senate Republicans' draft trillion dollar stimulus proposal didn't deliver on the request but did give the industry two important wins: temporarily freezing a 2 perent reduction in Medicare payments that was mandated under budget sequestration and boosting Medicare payments 15 percent for coronavirus-diagnosed cases. But with supplies tightening and beds already at a premium in some regions, investor-owned and nonprofit hospitals are lining up for more, along with airlines, hotels, retailers and other industries. The 1.5 trillion-dollar hospital industry drives one-third of the nation's health care spending, and typically collects much higher pay from private insurers than from Medicaid and Medicare. Elective procedures, like colonoscopies and cataract surgery, which the Trump administration wants suspended, make up some of their most profitable lines of business. Now, with a flood of coronavirus cases threatening to swamp emergency departments and intensive care units, hospitals want help as they transition to fighting the pandemic. It's a moment of solidarity for massive national for-profit and tax-exempt chains whose some executives rake in multi-million dollar salaries and small independent community and rural hospitals. The $100 billion ask from the American Hospital Association — joined by the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association — is built around the argument that it's better to get federal assistance before the full force of the pandemic hits, to fortify a health system that lacks the beds, necessary equipment and the workforce to deal with a pandemic. Hospital lobbyists want a massive infusion of cash for specialized gear to protect workers, child care for doctors and nurses and to offset revenue lost from the suspension of elective surgeries and other new costs. As prominent employers in many congressional districts, hospitals are used to being heard, and lawmakers are signaling that they’re ready to step in. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is closely aligned with New York’s hospital lobbies, vowed he’d fight for a “Marshall Plan for hospitals” Schumer’s calling for $400 billion to purchase equipment and deal with the expected swell in patients. The money would also address cash-flow issues for facilities that will take a major financial hit postponing lucrative elective procedures like joint replacements. The hospitals' lobbying push rapidly intensified this week as government officials presented sobering forecasts of staggering caseloads and reports out of virus-ravaged Italy showed overwhelmed hospitals rationing care — a harbinger of what could happen to the more unwieldy, patchwork U.S. system. Millions of Americans remain uninsured and some of the most impoverished states don’t have coverage for some low-income residents because they haven’t expanded Medicaid. But even in states that did, projections show the health system could be overwhelmed in a matter of weeks. Colorado, Kentucky, Massachusetts and Ohio have suspended elective surgeries to try and keep beds open.  The cancellation of these procedures began, for some, even before Surgeon General Jerome Adams urged them to do so over the weekend. Many patients simply heeded public officials' advice to stay home. Now, many hospitals are in limbo, waiting for a potential surge of Covid-19 patients. What this means for their financial situation varies. Small, rural hospitals, in particular, were already close to going broke before the virus hit, but they’re also used to operating on small margins. After years of consolidation, some big health systems in urban areas have built up huge overhead as their hospitals and specialty centers see a massive drop-off in referrals and appointments for pricey procedures. Meanwhile, hospitals in some hard-hit areas are grappling with more infected patients, coupled with a lack of personalized equipment to keep frontline nurses, doctors and other staff safe. “We’ve had a dramatic shift in our area in the last three to four days,” Cassie Sauer, president and CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association, said earlier this week. “The number of patients has grown exponentially.” Those hospitals that haven’t seen cases yet are ramping up for the pandemic. The waiting game raises questions about how long some hospitals can they keep paying their staff while turning away paying business at an ever-accelerating pace. Jose Sanchez, CEO of the Chicago safety net Norwegian American Hospital, said he’s got enough cash to make the next two payrolls. For now, he’s trying to make sure all expected billings come in on time — especially from private Medicaid plans where he’s seen a delay as insurers have their staff working from home. “If you were in a different business, you’d be laying people off, but that’s just the opposite of the situation we’re in,” said Charlie Shields, CEO of Truman Medical Centers in Kansas City, Mo., who’s canceled elective surgeries and seen a sharp drop in admissions. He hasn’t run out of cash yet and said they can run a while -- but he wants a federal funding boost in the meantime. And with the supply shortage of protective gear intensifying, Shields said he's seizing any chance to stock up on inventory, further driving up costs. Scott Christensen, CEO of Delta Regional Medical Center in Mississippi’s impoverished Delta region, said he expects the coronavirus to arrive at his doorstep any minute. Cases have been confirmed in neighboring counties and he’s setting up a drive-through testing site — mostly for free, since Mississippi didn’t expand Medicaid and imposes some of the strictest limits on who gets covered through the program. Christensen shuttered the hospital’s cardiac rehabilitation center and sleep center, and patients generally have stopped showing up. But he hasn't furloughed any workers — yet. “It’s been a really bad month financially,” he said. “But we’ll have to get through it.” Still, the situation isn’t equally dire for all, and some hospitals are used to empty beds. A study from Congress’ Medicare advisers found that most rural hospitals only have about 40 percent of their acute care beds occupied on a given day. Since coronavirus hospitalizations so far skew elderly, some may see a financial boost — especially if Congress goes through with the Medicare sequester freeze. Wall Street is sparking some of the financial concern. A J.P. Morgan analysis first reported by Bloomberg painted a grim picture for two major for-profit hospital chains — Community Health Systems and Tenet Healthcare Corp. — that also hold major debt and need to keep up their planned revenue from scheduled procedures. Chip Kahn, CEO of Federation of American Hospitals, which represents for-profit systems, said essentially the pandemic could upend some hospitals’ entire business models, by replacing expensive inpatient procedures with intensive coronavirus treatment. He warned, some big-name chains “could really be in trouble.” The average surgical hospital stay brings in nearly $44,000, compared to under $20,000 for a non-surgical stay. And the demographics will change, as coronavirus brings in more Medicaid and uninsured patients. He noted that for the seriously ill, hospitalizations rack up costs quickly, and as coronavirus spreads the cases may not all be covered with commercial insurance. That said, analysis from J.P. Morgan this week found 87 percent of responding hospitals said they hadn’t yet racked up extra staffing or supply costs due to coronavirus. The respondents said they also had not yet seen “measurable” deferments of scheduled procedures due to coronavirus fears, although that could be changing rapidly. Fitch, a ratings agency, said not-for-profit hospitals and health systems should have “sufficient financial cushion to absorb an increase in operating costs"" but warned, that some smaller facilities are at heightened risk, and the coming economic disruption will increase pressure on all providers.",Hospitals bid for $100 billion in next coronavirus package,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/hospitals-coronavirus-funding-138383,politico
"President Donald Trump has replaced a scheduled in-person gathering of G-7 world leaders at Camp David with a videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, the White House announced on Thursday. “In order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19 and at President Trump’s direction,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement, “National Economic Council Director and U.S. Sherpa for the 2020 G7 Larry Kudlow has informed his Sherpa colleagues that the G7 Leaders’ Summit the U.S. was set to host in June at Camp David will now be done by video-teleconference.” Trump spoke with leaders from the seven nations this week via videoconference in what Deere said was the first time the group has met virtually. “The White House also informed the other G7 members that in order to continue close coordination, the President will convene the Leaders’ via video teleconference in April and May just as he did this week,” Deere added. The White House said the decision to hold the meeting via videoconference was made so that member nations could devote the resources it would have used to attend the June meeting to help their own countries. The decision comes as a number of G-7 nations, including Italy and Germany, have closed their borders. Others, like Canada and the U.S., have tightened travel restrictions for their residents. Trump originally decided in October to host this year’s conference at his Trump National Doral Miami resort, but hastily scrapped the plans after drawing criticism from allies and members of his own party who said he was using his office to promote his personal properties.",G-7 meeting replaced with teleconference due to coronavirus,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/g7-meeting-replaced-with-teleconference-due-to-coronavirus-138338,politico
"Doctors and nurses across the U.S. say shortages of masks and other safety gear are putting them and their coworkers at risk, despite White House assurances that the supply gaps from the coronavirus pandemic are being addressed by policy fixes and donations from good Samaritans. As health providers take to social media to plead with the federal government to make more gear available, and state officials hold press conferences begging other industries to donate masks to their local hospitals, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence insisted from the White House podium Thursday that plenty of masks are available now. “We put a priority at the president's direction on making sure health care services through America have the protection to keep themselves and their family safe,” Pence said, saying that the bill Congress approved this week lifting legal liability for masks not previously approved for hospital use will allow tens of millions produced by the company 3M and others to be sold for the treatment of coronavirus patients. “We vastly increased the supply of medical masks and we'll continue to put a priority on making sure we are calling on industry at every level, calling on major suppliers that the president met with this week to make sure those equipment are there,” he said. Guidance from the CDC released Monday that bluntly acknowledged the shortages tells another story. That advice, which health care workers tell POLITICO they consider dangerous, includes reusing respirator masks between different patient visits, using masks that have passed their expiration date, and even constructing “homemade” masks out of a bandana or scarf. With medical workers already getting sick and dying from the disease in Washington state and other coronavirus hot spots, health care workers tell POLITICO they’re terrified for themselves and their patients. “It’s the scariest thing about going to work every day,” said Sean Petty, a pediatric ER nurse and member of the New York State Nurses Association. Petty told POLITICO that his public sector hospital in the Bronx implemented what he described as “extreme rationing” of masks this week. Petty also noted the shortage has forced his hospital to only provide masks to patients who have severe enough symptoms to qualify to be tested for coronavirus — which could be risky because the transmission of the virus from asymptomatic patients is not fully understood. Despite the ramped-up domestic production the Trump administration touted Thursday, those on the ground say it's unclear when those supplies will make it into medical providers’ hands. The 500 million masks the federal government ordered this week, for example, may not be delivered for another 18 months. Jamie Lucas, executive director of the Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, said Thursday that none of his members have heard from their employers that more masks are on the way. “They're preparing as if what they have is what they’ll have,"" he said, including rationing and reusing masks in potentially unsafe ways. A 2006 report by the National Academies of Sciences’ Institute of medicine both predicted the current shortage and warned against the repeated use of a single mask. “These devices will be in short supply if a pandemic strikes,” the report found. “And there is currently no simple, reliable way to decontaminate these devices that would enable people to safely use them more than once.” A registered nurse at a large nonprofit hospital in Manhattan, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job, told POLITICO she was given an online training last week about the protective gear she needed to wear when caring for potential coronavirus patients and that the training stressed the use of an n-95 respirator mask. But when she was called in this week to assist with a patient showing flu-like symptoms, she was told by management that a regular surgical mask was adequate protection — echoing the recent shift in the CDC's guidelines. Despite deep misgivings, she spent hours in the room with the patient. “I’m worried about myself and my colleagues being put at risk, and I’m also worried that we’re not doing nearly enough to prevent transmission from infected patient to staff to other patients who may be immunocompromised,” she said. Nurses and doctors are not the only ones at risk. Lucas told POLITICO that hospital cleaning staff have been directed to clean rooms that held coronavirus patients without a mask in order to conserve them for medical providers. Even with new data showing the virus can survive on surfaces for hours, the unprotected cleaners are expected to turn over the rooms for new patients much more quickly. As of Thursday afternoon, hundreds of thousands of health care workers had signed an online petition demanding the government do more to ensure an adequate supply of masks and other protective equipment. Yet federal aid has been slow to arrive. On Wednesday, the Trump administration invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of desperately needed hospital equipment. Though the White House had discussed taking this step for weeks, it has not yet done the required assessment of what supplies are most in need, meaning those items may take months to actually make it to the front lines. Trump also indicated he was in no hurry to move forward, tweeting this week that he only signed the act “should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.” Many states say that “worst case scenario” has arrived. On Thursday, Massachusetts lawmakers wrote to the Trump administration saying they had only received 10 percent of the 750,000 masks and other equipment they requested weeks ago, and warned that the state's hospitals are ""facing or are imminently anticipating shortages."" The office of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose state has more than 900 confirmed cases, said Thursday there are still ""substantial shortages"" of protective gear despite two shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile. Inslee's office said the federal government hasn't filled the state's most recent request for tens of thousands of additional N-95 respirators, surgical masks and face shields. The stockpile of medical equipment, originally designed for use during a nuclear disaster or biological attack, was never intended to last during a prolonged pandemic. Officials in Ohio say what they‘ve received from the stockpile falls far short of hospitals' needs.  “Ohio has received our full allocation from the national strategic stockpile,” Tamara McBride, the chief of the Bureau of Health Preparedness at the Ohio Department of Health, told reporters earlier this week. “If we do not take conservation steps now, we will not have health care workers that are protected to care for the most sick.” Like other states, Ohio’s leaders have asked veterinarians and dentists to donate masks and other materials to hospitals. They have also asked food service workers to donate latex gloves. A hospital in Atlanta has even had to rely on a donation of masks, gloves, and gowns from a TV medical drama being filmed nearby.  Pence lavished praise Thursday on the construction industry for responding to the federal government's call to donate masks, but did not say how many have been obtained that way. And as recently as Tuesday, the Association of General Contractors said the administration had not consulted with it about this request, and the group worried that the loss of masks would put their own workers at risk. ""Without those masks, they would be immediately out of work, because they can‘t work without masks,"" said Vice President of Public Affairs Brian Turmail. AGC added Thursday that HHS had asked the group to send an inventory of all their members' available safety equipment, including masks and protective suits, but no donations have yet been made. ""We are going to ask our chapters tomorrow morning to collect this information and share it with HHS,” Turmail said. In the meantime, all sectors of the medical community are doing whatever they can to conserve masks. Medical students, for example, have halted their clinical rotations, and hospitals have suspended elective procedures. Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told reporters on a call Thursday that the lack of masks and other personal protective equipment remains the “number one issue” she’s hearing from teaching hospitals battling coronavirus. “Are we worried about this? Yes, we are,” she said. “We are really going to have to push to get more PPE into the hands of our health care workers.” Gavin Bade contributed reporting.",Medical staff describe shortages and rationing of masks as White House assures they’re available ’now’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-medical-supplies-138290,politico
"For many Americans right now, the scale of the coronavirus crisis calls to mind 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis—events that reshaped society in lasting ways, from how we travel and buy homes, to the level of security and surveillance we’re accustomed to, and even to the language we use. Politico Magazine surveyed more than thirty smart, macro thinkers this week, and they have some news for you: Buckle in. This could be bigger. A global, novel virus that keeps us contained in our homes—maybe for months—is already reorienting our relationship to government, to the outside world, even to each other. Some changes these experts expect to see in the coming months or years might feel unfamiliar or unsettling: Will nations stay closed? Will touch become taboo? What will become of restaurants? But crisis moments also present opportunity: more sophisticated and flexible use of technology, less polarization, a revived appreciation for the outdoors and life’s other simple pleasures.

"National security staffers are fretting that confusing telework guidance has left an overabundance of employees showing up to the office amid a global pandemic.  While health officials have encouraged Americans to work from home if possible as the coronavirus spreads through the United States, Pentagon and intelligence community officials have sent mixed signals about what their own staffers should do, according to three national security officials and a top senator who oversees the intelligence community. As a result, these staffers said, some Defense Department civilian employees who don’t need to be at work are still coming in every day, raising the risk that the virus will spread through the Pentagon’s ranks. “You go outside the building and every other workplace is saying go home, but there are quite a few people in the building that are not mission-essential,” said one defense official. At issue is the question of how national security and intelligence officials who feel they need to self-quarantine but can’t work from home are supposed to get time off. Agency spokespeople said there are various options for employees in such scenarios, but several officials said these offerings have been insufficient and poorly messaged. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, picked up on these complaints and recently wrote Defense Secretary Mark Esper, expressing concern. “These personnel should not face uncertainty or obstacles in their efforts to preserve our individual or collective health,” he wrote in a letter obtained by POLITICO. Warner said the instructions “have ambiguity that is creating confusion and anxiety,” calling the issue a “matter of urgent priority.” The Pentagon defended its approach, pointing out that its guidelines are consistent with government-wide instructions issued by the Office of Personnel Management. Pentagon spokesperson Alyssa Farah said employees can use paid “weather and safety leave” — paid time off when employees can't safely get to work — if they want to self-quarantine yet are not eligible to telework. Another Pentagon spokesperson added that OPM guidance lets agencies give advanced sick leave to employees who run out of it, noting that employees can also request an advance on their annual paid time off allotment. But several staffers said such instructions have been inconsistent and incomplete. Another U.S. official said some workers at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency — which analyzes images captured by America’s spy satellites — have been directed to use sick leave if they need to quarantine themselves and can’t work from home. NGA employees have a finite amount of sick leave, and the official feared the directions would discourage people from staying away from the office even if they felt they could expose others to the coronavirus.  The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record, called the instructions “dangerous and unfair.” A spokesperson for the agency said officials had approved weather and safety leave for employees who can’t telework. Teleworking is a challenge for many defense and intelligence officials, since many have to handle secret material or work on secure networks. It’s a particular problem for lower-level staffers who do not have the equipment to work remotely, or who must physically be in the building to check classified emails and access secret servers. “It’s just very difficult to do our job without being in the building,” a third government official told POLITICO. But because close contact with others can spread the virus, national security agencies are working to dramatically reduce how many people are in the building at any moment. The Pentagon is urging all of its 23,000 employees who can work from home to do so if possible, and looking to acquire additional devices to enable remote access to the Pentagon’s secret and classified networks. Many offices will “voluntarily go to minimal staffing,” including staggering shifts in the building “to limit cross-interaction.” At the NGA, for instance, a spokesperson said the agency is aiming to have half as many people in its offices as would be there normally. And many staffers at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are also doing their work from home, according to two people close to the agency. An ODNI spokesperson said the agency is also using staggered shifts to limit how many people are present at any specific time. Still, coronavirus cases have been creeping up throughout the Defense Department community in recent days. As of March 18, 51 service-members had tested positive for the virus, along with nine civilians, 10 military family members and 11 contractors. Several National Security Agency employees have also put themselves in quarantine after returning home from countries with large coronavirus outbreaks, according to the U.S. government official. An intelligence official said that none of those employees have tested positive for the virus. At the Pentagon, some civilians are choosing to come to work instead of taking leave because they can’t afford to lose a paycheck, defense officials said. While the Pentagon has urged its employees to telework and restricted Pentagon visitors, it still hasn’t imposed its most severe limitations on in-person work. Right now, Esper has only increased the Health Protection Condition level to BRAVO, or “moderate,” meaning at-risk civilians who do not have telework agreements must take sick leave rather than administrative leave in order to work from home, defense officials said. In the Navy, for example, civilian employees can take an advance on their annual paid leave, according to a spokesperson. Employees without symptoms can also use “weather and safety” leave to telework, the spokesperson added. That arrangement might change if Esper raised the Health Protection Condition level to CHARLIE, or “substantial.” Individual telework agreements are also subject to the approval of direct supervisors, defense officials said, creating another potential complication. “If someone wants to get a telework agreement, they can ask their supervisor. If the supervisor denies it because he/she needs the worker at the office, then they will have to take sick leave if they don’t want to come to work,” said another defense official. Before the crisis, many supervisors at the Pentagon looked unfavorably on telework agreements because they were frequently abused, the defense official said, adding that some may have been reluctant to grant them “as a threshold matter.” The result is that civilians are still coming to work every day who are not “mission essential,” said the first defense official, noting that the situation is causing “frustration.”  “Is this a national emergency or not? Clearly, it’s not,” the official said.", ‘Confusion and anxiety’ at Pentagon over telework guidance,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/pentagon-telework-coronavirus-137731,politico
"It would cost the U.S. up to $2 billion to adjust the country's voting processes in ways that would allow November's election to go on, even if the coronavirus pandemic persists, according to a new think tank study. The cost would come from implementing nationwide changes like universal voting by mail, expanded online voter registration and increased public health safeguards at polling places, the authors at the Brennan Center for Justice estimate. The analysis comes as the pandemic wreaks havoc on the primary election calendar, with several states opting to postpone their contests weeks, if not months, to slow the spread of the disease. ""There is no question that the Covid-19 pandemic presents a difficult and, in many ways, unprecedented challenge to America’s elections,"" the analysis says. The costs include up to $1.4 billion for every state to ensure universal voting by mail, according to the preliminary estimate. Of that, as much as $593 million would be spent on additional postage costs, while $240 million would go toward bolstering absentee ballot processing. In addition, the study says it would cost almost $272 million to maintain existing in-person voting systems, including for people without access to mail or the internet. The bulk of that figure, an estimated $140 million, would hire more poll workers and boost their pay. The study estimates that another nearly $86 million would need to be funneled to states to ""adopt and bolster online voter registration systems,"" while $252 million would be spent on raising public awareness.",Think tank estimates $2 billion cost to carry out November election during pandemic,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/2020-election-cost-coronavirus-138232,politico
"The coronavirus outbreak could close down many U.S. classrooms for the rest of the school year, blowing a hole in kids' math and reading skills, tanking test scores for years to come and making it a scramble for some to even finish high school. Kansas schools that have shuttered through the end of the school year likely are just the first in line, with governors in California, New Jersey and Ohio signaling the same is possible for their states. Many schools initially announced closures for a short period, but with warnings from the White House growing more dire, shutdowns are extending — even though the CDC says it's not certain that will halt the spread of the virus. The CDC has said in its updated guidance for schools that closures of eight weeks or more may affect community spread, but hand-washing and home isolation have had more impact. Testing is being postponed or scrapped entirely as schools rush instead to gear up for remote learning and figure out how to distribute school meals. As of Thursday morning, an estimated 43.9 million school students were enrolled in at least 95,000 public or private schools that are closed now, are scheduled to close or were closed and reopened, according to Education Week. The closures could mean students who are struggling to read at their grade level are promoted anyway and could struggle for years to come. Plans for college could be upended for high school seniors counting on their final semester to rack up credits and take one more stab at the SAT. For students from low-income families, who could have trouble getting to the free or subsidized food many of them rely on, the gap between them and their wealthier counterparts is all but sure to grow. But all students will suffer. Schools in other countries have smoothly moved to remote learning, but the U.S. faces barriers not only in computer access but getting those services to students quickly and equitably. “We know kids in low socioeconomic communities lose two to three months in reading and math skills over a normal summer. With schools letting out now and potentially not returning before the end of the school year, learning loss may be profound,” said Betsy Zorio, vice president of U.S. programs and advocacy at Save the Children. “Summer programs to mitigate further loss and after-school programs in the fall will be critical to help them catch up — and reach those critical milestones of third grade reading and math proficiency.” The disruptions are happening just ahead of testing time, adding to the turmoil. The Education Department last week announced it would consider one-year waivers of school test requirements, but there is some interest in a national testing waiver. The Council of Chief State School Officers has been advocating for speeding up the process for states to obtain waivers, and says it looks like it will happen. Carissa Moffat Miller, the group’s executive director, told reporters Wednesday that such a decision would allow school officials faced with an unprecedented crisis to focus on “more critical education, health and nutrition concerns.” In Louisiana, Gov. Bel Edwards announced he would shelve standardized tests for students. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called off state testing at all grade levels on Tuesday. And New York halted preparations for this year’s standardized assessments for grades 3-8, suspended shipments of paper-based English language arts exams and postponed the opening of its computer-based testing portal that had been scheduled for March 23. Test scores will drop and it’s “only a question of how much,” said Douglas Harris, a Tulane economics professor and founding director of the Education Research Alliance for New Orleans who studied the effects of school reforms after Katrina in 2005. “There's no way in which this is going to be helpful to students academically.” Harris found that test scores for fourth grade students, who were in New Orleans before Katrina in 2005 and returned in the spring of 2006, dipped in every subject except social studies, and the dip continued in 2007. He attributes the outcomes mostly to the disruption and trauma. This situation should be more manageable academically because many schools are still operating, even if virtually, so there will be less trauma and the disruption may be shorter. But he still sees similarities between the two events: Both forced students from their schools, and while today’s students aren’t fleeing their homes, the coronavirus is shoving students into social isolation — and it’s still scary. “Schools will do the best they can under the circumstances, but they don't have practice in this,” Harris said. “So teachers are going to be winging it and students will almost certainly not learn as much as they were in the past. And that's what we saw with Katrina.” The virus has cascading consequences in store for the education system, Moffat Miller said, consequences that won’t vanish if and when the virus stops circulating. Some students are better equipped to learn outside of the classroom than other students. States and school systems face enormous costs. Testing and other systems designed to make schools accountable will need to be modified. “And there will inevitably be questions that we haven't even thought of yet that we're going to need to address,” Moffat Miller said. For high school students headed to college, it's meant trying to stay on top of shifting and confusing college testing plans. Earlier this week, the College Board announced it was exploring options to have students take much-anticipated AP exams at home ""depending on the situation in May,"" with more information to come. The exams are the end point for a year's study of college-level material and high scores can be used in some instances for college credits. ACT on Monday announced that its test scheduled for April 4 will now take place on June 13 instead. The College Board announced it was canceling the SAT scheduled for May 2. In Kansas, where schools are expected to be out through June, the Department of Education’s continuous learning task force, comprised of educators, has worked on guidance to help schools. They are working to move education online, assist students without access to online tools, provide for at-risk students and those with individual education plans and distribute meals for students who need them. “We're looking at special ed students and what requirements we have for them and to get their best learning in place. We're looking at seniors who are trying to graduate and are in panic mode because they don't know how they will. We're looking at all of those things so that learning will continue,” said Marcus Baltzell, spokesperson for the Kansas National Education Association. He added, “We're essentially redesigning education in Kansas and we're doing it in three days.” Washington state recently started working on potential criteria for a streamlined process to ensure that students who are on track to graduate this year can actually do so. Student closures, even from vacations, always have high costs for learning, said Andreas Schleicher, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s education director and head of the Programme for International Student Assessment, which measures high school students' performance internationally. But he said the U.S. can look to other countries, such as China, where students were quickly moved to an organized learning environment online. Some teachers in France, he said, have been working with their students on Zoom, which gives them a way to connect even if it’s not an education platform. “I think the U.S. can really learn from those countries that have been able to manage this in a matter of weeks or days to bridge that kind of school-closure gap,” he said. “So I think this is not an insurmountable kind of challenge.” The U.S. is different from other parts of the world, however, in that its systems are decentralized, with no national standards or curriculum, said Ary Amerikaner, vice president for P-12 policy, practice and research at The Education Trust. “While each state has common standards, individual educators may be using different instructional materials and a variety of electronic resources at their disposal,” she wrote in an email. The other issue is digital equity. “Many of our schools were not set up for remote learning, and, where it does exist, there are concerns about how equitable access and opportunities are for our most vulnerable students,” she wrote. Millions of students in the U.S. already struggle with what’s known as the “homework gap” because they don’t have broadband internet at home, and school closures will worsen the digital divide for these students, typically from low-income and minority households. Senate Democrats are pushing to address this issue as part of a legislative response to the pandemic, and the Federal Communications Commission is working with Congress to secure funds for programs to support in-home equipment for affected students. Extra support from states and the federal government is “essential” now, said Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN, the Consortium for School Networking. The FCC should also strengthen and offer more flexibility from its educational technology program, E-Rate, and provide mobile hotspots and broadband connections to rural and other unconnected students and teachers, he said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Education Department, states and districts should invest in training on teaching strategies for this emergency, he said. ""Utilizing e-learning is quickly becoming a requirement of school districts across the country and not just a choice, he said in a statement. Harris, meanwhile, wrote in a blog for Brookings that while technology could be used to help students in the short term, more funding should be devoted to summer school. “Sometimes it’s best to fight the old-fashioned way,” he said.

"The Pentagon and the White House, in the weeks leading up to the president’s national emergency declaration on Friday, quarreled over the response to the coronavirus outbreak that was sweeping the country. Defense Department leaders urged measures such as restricting troop travel in order to contain the virus. But other administration officials pushed back, arguing against any “rash” steps that could have political ramifications and economic impact, defense officials told POLITICO. It wasn't until President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 that leaders began to coalesce around a strategy. Trump’s comments served as a “green light” for DoD leaders to take more aggressive steps such as providing medical equipment, putting field hospitals on alert and making preparations to dispatch the military’s twin hospital ships to virus hotspots, said one defense official. “We’re muddling through,” the official said. From the start of the crisis, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has given his deputies — the service chiefs, combatant commanders and civilian leaders — flexibility to issue guidance to a mammoth force of almost 3 million people, including 1.3 million active-duty military and their families. And in recent days, senior Pentagon officials advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former administration official. Esper obliged, making appearances on Fox News, CNN and in the White House briefing room to lay out a number of steps the department is taking to support the coronavirus response. “I want to assure all of your viewers that the United States military remains ready and capable of defending the American people, protecting the nation and safeguarding our interests abroad,” Esper said on Fox News on Tuesday. But absent clear direction from the White House, the Pentagon’s initial internal response to the crisis, was ad hoc. In recent days, officials have scrambled to prepare the Navy's hospital ships, USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy, to help relieve pressure on civilian hospitals, defense officials said. Despite Trump’s assertion that the ships are “in tip-top shape,” the Comfort, homeported in Norfolk, Va., has been in pierside maintenance since December after returning from a five-month deployment and will not get underway until April 2. Meanwhile the Mercy, based out of San Diego, will be able to launch to its West Coast destination, either in California or Washington State, on Monday. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. In its efforts to get the Comfort underway as soon as possible, the Navy’s Military Sealift Command, which is responsible for the hospital ships, has been forced to defer ""a small amount"" of scheduled work on the vessels until a later date, a Navy spokesperson said. Guidance on domestic and international travel for troops also trickled out in a disjointed fashion over the past few weeks. U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East and Afghanistan, canceled all leave and liberty travel for U.S. troops serving in the region on Feb. 27. On the same day, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command postponed a major exercise with South Korea, and the Navy ordered all ships that have visited countries in the Pacific region to remain at sea for 14 days in order to monitor sailors for any symptoms. But DoD-wide travel restrictions did not go into effect until March 11, when Esper banned movement of DoD civilians and families traveling to, from or through “Level 3” locations — such as South Korea, Iran and Italy — for 60 days. In some ways the Department of Defense has been ahead of the curve on the coronavirus crisis. Even before the first cases were reported in South Korea on Feb. 2, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea began enforcing strict measures in January, including testing, self-isolation and social distancing. Pentagon leaders began contingency planning for the crisis six weeks ago, said another defense official. The Defense Department has also been conducting regular, sometimes twice-daily, press briefings on the crisis in recent days, sending senior officials such as Esper, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel and others to the podium to talk about the department’s response. This is a sharp contrast to the State Department, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been criticized for a lack of transparency. But until this week, department leaders were not always on the same page. While Esper believes commanders and service leaders are in the best position to make major decisions for their forces, he has given explicit instructions to those officials that any major decision needs to be communicated up the chain of command, officials say. After being blindsided on multiple occasions over the past few weeks, Esper has had to intervene at lower levels to ensure the department presents a unified front, three current and former defense officials tell POLITICO. “It comes back to: we shouldn’t learn about these through media channels or them becoming public,” said one defense official. “But the last thing we want to do is hamstring those commanders.” After the Army on March 8 preempted DoD in ordering a halt to the movement of troops and their families into and out of Italy and South Korea, Esper was forced to step in, two defense officials said. The secretary stressed to Army leadership the need to keep him and the Joint Chiefs informed of any new guidance, according to the officials. The Pentagon on Monday banned all domestic and international travel through at least May 11. Esper intervened once more over the weekend after the Army considered freezing basic training for new recruits amid concern about virus spread, according to three defense officials. The Washington Post first reported the Army's move. Esper met with the leaders of the armed services on Monday to discuss the issue, ultimately deciding to continue basic training while taking precautionary measures, one of the defense officials said. Since Monday, Esper and the rest of the department have spent a good bit of time in front of cameras. Speaking alongside Trump on Wednesday, Esper said that in addition to preparing the hospital ships, which are equipped with 1,000 beds each, he has alerted field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as needed to support the response. These capabilities are designed for trauma and other combat injuries, Esper stressed, and will be used to relieve pressure on civilian hospitals treating coronavirus victims. Separately, the Pentagon has opened its 16 certified coronavirus testing labs to test non-DoD personnel; will make available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves; and will distribute up to 2,000 deployable ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services, Esper said. “We have plans in place. We've been implementing them now for several weeks. And we're also wanting to lean forward and support again, the whole government approach to assist the American people,” Esper said on Fox.",Trump’s wobbly coronavirus response leaves Pentagon playing catchup,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-pentagon-coronavirus-defense-138095,politico

"Even by Washington standards, a trillion dollars is a lot of money. It could fund the Environmental Protection Agency for 120 years, or the Securities and Exchange Commission for 550 years, or 20 end-to-end border walls with Mexico. It could buy every American adult four new iPhone 11 Pros. The last time the U.S. economy imploded, after the 2008 financial crisis, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned then-President-Elect Barack Obama’s team that if he wanted to pass a stimulus bill, he shouldn’t even bother proposing anything that required the T-word. But President Donald Trump is about to do just that, and suddenly a 13-digit ask no longer seems so controversial. With the coronavirus slamming U.S. commerce to a halt, Trump’s administration has released the outlines of a $1 trillion stimulus proposal, half to send checks to individuals, half to backstop ailing businesses. [Update: Senate Republicans have now released their own trillion-dollar package.] And barely a decade after the vicious partisan war over Obama’s merely $800 billion The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Republicans and Democrats generally seem to agree that a $1 trillion stimulus package makes perfect sense—on top of two bipartisan pandemic response bills with a combined $100 billion-plus price tag that have already flown through Congress—and may well need to be followed up with even more stimulus. Their disagreements will be about what’s in it. The two-page memo summarizing Trump’s proposal that the Treasury Department released Wednesday is as short on details as it is long on dollars, but as a starter document, it gives a sense of what the president wants. “We’re going big,” Trump declared at a White House press conference. “We don’t want airlines going out of business or people losing their jobs and not having money to live.” People are already losing their jobs, and money is already getting tight, but this time, it seems like Washington might send help in a hurry. Here are some of the questions raised by the five main elements of Trump’s plan—and also by what’s left out of it. The $500 billion centerpiece of the Trump stimulus is a meme-maker’s dream, a straightforward proposal to give American taxpayers money. Obama’s economists, 11 years ago, described the ideal short-term stimulus as “timely, temporary, and targeted,” and sending people checks is certainly timely—the memo proposed one round in April and a second in May—as well as temporary. But it’s not yet clear whether the Trump version will be targeted at the poorer Americans who are most desperate for help and most likely to help the economy by spending it quickly to pay bills or buy essentials. The memo did say the payments would be “tiered based on income level and family size,” but did not specify whether the “individual taxpayers” who receive them would include the 75 million Americans who don’t earn enough to pay federal income tax, who presumably need the money the most, or, for that matter, millionaires and billionaires who don’t need the help. Congressional Republicans suggested Thursday that the payments could be “phased in,” so poorer families would actually get less. Nevertheless, there’s wide agreement that sending people money can be good stimulus—and it can be even better politics, which is why nobody in Washington wants to try to stop the cash train. Like the Danny DeVito character said in Heist: Everyone likes money. That’s why they call it money. Republicans would have screamed bloody murder if Obama had written $500 billion worth of checks and simply added the cost to the federal deficit, but under Trump, they’ve stopped warning about debt crises or national bankruptcy or runs on the dollar. So what’s not to like? Direct government payments are hard to steal, hard to screw up and easy to understand. Forget timely, temporary and targeted. Dumping cash on the American people is like those Xfinity ads: simple, easy, awesome. Trump recently suggested that when it came to industry rescues, “airlines would be Number One,” and the memo includes a $50 billion secured lending program designed to keep American passenger and cargo carriers in the air. There does seem to be broad agreement that the airlines, unlike cruise lines or restaurants or other businesses devastated by the pandemic, are vital to the functioning of the economy and the country. And even though the airlines asked for an aid package evenly divided between grants and loans, the Treasury plan would limit aid to collateralized loans that would presumably be paid back with interest after the crisis subsides, much like the 2008 bank bailouts that turned a profit for taxpayers. The memo even floated the idea of limits on increases in executive compensation until the loans are repaid, a nod to populist anger that is also reminiscent of restrictions on bank compensation in the 2008 bailout. But Democrats are already pushing to attach much tougher conditions on the airlines, which have spent the vast majority of their cash in recent years on stock buybacks that enriched their investors and executives. They want to attach harsh limits on buybacks and dividends as well as executive bonuses in exchange for Uncle Sam’s largesse. A group of eight senators has even called for attaching restrictions on the industry’s carbon emissions, which is clearly not a concern of Trump’s. The Treasury memo actually suggests that airlines should face “continuation of service requirements,” which could amount to a perverse requirement to fly empty planes when most Americans are no longer traveling. The memo also suggests $150 billion in aid to “Other Severely Distressed Sectors of the U.S. Economy,” which will probably include just about all of them by the end of the month. This one-sentence placeholder is likely to inspire the most pushback, in part because in addition to secured loans, it floats “loan guarantees,” which means the government would be on the hook if they aren't repaid. But the real question would be who qualifies for a bailout, and what would make them deserving. Trump recently pointed out that cruise lines are not at fault for their ongoing plunge in bookings, but one prominent Republican told me in an email: “No aid to cruise lines. Not essential. Owned by foreigners who don’t pay taxes or billionaires.” Climate-conscious Democrats are likely to be even less enthusiastic about bailouts for oil and gas interests that have been battered by the virus and an overseas price war. And bailouts for the tourism and hospitality industries could be even more controversial, partly because it’s even less clear how they’re essential to national survival, partly because Democrats will not want to bail out the international hotelier who currently lives in the White House. The industry lobbyists begging for bailouts argue that they need help in order to help their workers, but a more reliable way for the government to help workers is just to help the workers directly. The cruise lines say they need help to avoid layoffs, but it’s hard to imagine that they’ll avoid layoffs when they’re not offering cruises—so where will the money go? One of Trump’s proposals should not cost taxpayers a dime, but may be his most frightening ask: a federal guarantee for the $2.6 trillion money market fund industry. Treasury did this on its own during the 2008 financial crisis after one fund collapsed, and it instantly reassured panicked depositors who were pulling their cash out of other funds, as well as panicked companies that relied on the funds to buy “corporate paper” to finance their operations. But after the backlash against bailouts, Congress stripped Treasury’s power to do it again. So Trump would need a vote to do it this time. It makes sense to reassure the markets that money market funds will be safe, although it does raise the question of whether the funds should pay the government for insurance if they’re going to get backstopped whenever times get tough. It also feels a bit like a backdoor bank bailout, since one effect will be to reassure skittish companies that have been drawing down lines of credit from banks that they can rely on corporate paper instead. But the most pressing question it raises is: Are these funds in more trouble than we realize? The last time Treasury did this was at the height of the worst panic since the Depression. Slipping this financial provision into an economic stimulus bill may be a far-sighted move to give Treasury the tools it would need to deal with a potential banking panic, but it could also send a message that Treasury is worried about a banking panic, and those kinds of messages can panic bankers. The final piece of the Trump proposal is a $300 billion loan guarantee program to help small businesses keep their entire workforce on their payroll for eight weeks. This idea seems both unimaginably large—it’s seven times the annual budget for the State Department—and absurdly small, since there are 28 million small businesses in America, and it’s hard to see how restaurants or gyms or stores that don’t have customers are going to be able to pay back the loans after they pay their workers not to work for eight weeks. It feels like a program that could work if the business interruptions are very short, in which case it might not even get started in time to help, but it feels likely to get swamped by demand if the pandemic keeps the country on lockdown for long. The goal is to reduce disruption to people’s lives and careers—everyone prefers a paycheck to a government check—but this will be an extraordinarily disruptive crisis, and again, airlifting money to businesses is not always the most efficient way to help their employees, especially if the businesses end up failing anyway. The Obama stimulus included nearly $100 billion targeted directly at the most vulnerable victims of the Great Recession, particularly the poor and the unemployed. That aid turned out to be extremely effective not only in reducing poverty and easing pain but in reviving the economy; this Dartmouth study estimated that every dollar spent on the poor created from $1.96 to $2.31 in economic activity. The Trump proposal makes no effort to target the poor, although the bipartisan emergency response bill does include a modest boost in unemployment benefits and food aid. Similarly, Obama’s stimulus sent about $250 billion directly to cash-strapped state and local governments, many run by Obama’s political enemies, so they wouldn’t have to slash services, raise taxes or lay off workers; studies found that aid to states also helped the U.S. avoid a second Great Depression, helping governors and mayors avoid “anti-stimulus” at the worst possible time. The Trump proposal did not include state aid, either, although Democrats did get a boost in the federal share of Medicaid payments in that bipartisan emergency bill. In general, the Trump approach favors aid to businesses over aid to governments or the needy. And at least for now, it opts for just a few massive programs rather than a litany of small programs, an approach that will be sorely tested on Capitol Hill. Congress larded up the Obama stimulus with all kinds of quirky add-ons, from fire stations to military hospitals to cemetery maintenance to emergency farm loans; Senate Appropriations Chairman Daniel Inouye inserted $198 million for Filipino veterans who had been denied benefits they were promised after fighting alongside Americans in World War II, an honorable but not particularly stimulative provision. The Trump approach has different vulnerabilities—strip clubs and porn studios may apply for business interruption loans, too—but its omissions could make it easier to pass and potentially easier to defend. The trillion-dollar question is what Democrats will demand as their price for bailing out the sinking Trump economy. Pelosi has already warned that she wants to target the spending to the families that need it most. Democratic Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have proposed to make vote-by-mail available to every American, a provision that could ease fears that coronavirus could disrupt the 2020 election, while Patty Murray of Washington and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have said they won’t accept a stimulus without a dramatic expansion of paid sick leave for workers. The Obama stimulus included a powerful independent oversight board that scrutinized every dime, and perhaps as a result, it produced remarkably low levels of fraud and abuse; Democrats would like to see the same kind of oversight for Trump. It’s also tempting to look beyond the current crisis. Democratic economists have floated the possibility of including permanent “countercyclical stabilizers,” which would automatically provide stimulus for a faltering economy even if a Democrat were in the White House and Republicans rediscovered their allergy to deficit spending. And after the Obama stimulus helped jump-start the clean-energy economy with massive investments in solar, wind and electric vehicle batteries, some Democrats are interested in using the Trump stimulus to advance long-term priorities like transit, green infrastructure, or at least virus-related public health initiatives. Of course, time is of the essence, and the president is sure to demand immediate action on his proposals, while accusing House Democrats of leaving Americans to suffer if they don’t pass them right away. If they complain that the package doesn’t include funding for additional hospital beds, or for manufacturing ventilators, or for feeding the hungry, well, Trump and the Republicans seem perfectly willing to pass another stimulus bill after this one goes out the door. In Washington, a trillion dollars doesn’t seem to go as far as it used to.","What Trump’s Trillion-Dollar Bailout Gets Right, and Wrong",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/trump-coronavirus-bailout-economy-plan-137680,politico
"OTTAWA — Justin Trudeau’s week will one day fill the pages of Canadian history books — he’s sealed off the U.S. frontier to non-essential travelers, unleashed a huge economic aid package and moved closer to invoking a law that can empower the government to limit civil liberties. And the G-7 leader has done it all from home, with his three young kids underfoot. In fact, for more than a week, the prime minister has looked after the children solo — 24/7 — as the only able adult in the house. He and his kids entered 14 days of self-isolation together after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for Covid-19 last Thursday. He insists he’s fine and says Sophie, who is quarantined in one part of their house, is feeling better despite mild flu-like symptoms. There are no caregivers or political staff at the Trudeau home, just the five members of his immediate family, a government official told POLITICO. Like so many parents now working from home, he's encountered some challenges. Trudeau was late for an evening phone meeting with political staff this week after getting delayed by six-year-old Hadrien’s bathtime, said the official who was on the call. From the homefront, the prime minister has also been in the thick of domestic and international coordination on coronavirus, fielding calls from U.S. President Donald Trump, other world leaders, provincial premiers and his cabinet ministers. He even participated in a video conference call with fellow G-7 leaders about a joint Covid-19 response while he sat in his home office, where his kids’ artwork can be seen tacked on the wall. Trudeau tweeted a photo taken by his daughter Ella-Grace, 11, of the moment. The image showed the prime minister all by himself while some of his peers, like Trump, were seated at boardroom tables flanked by officials. Trudeau has about a week left in self-isolation and, the official said, it could mean he will be absent from the House of Commons next week when Parliament reviews his multibillion-dollar rescue plan. Elements of the package must be approved by a quorum of MPs, who will be recalled to Ottawa. Trudeau has said his cabinet is also mulling whether to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government extraordinary powers to, among other things, restrict the mobility of Canadians. Such an unprecedented step would also need parliamentary approval and, if cabinet decides to move forward with the law, Trudeau may not be present for the debate. All of these major steps have been discussed by phone from inside Rideau Cottage, a red-bricked house on the property of the Governor-General’s much larger residence Rideau Hall. But despite the situation, Trudeau has increased his public appearances. He’s been slipping outdoors to hold almost-daily news conferences a few steps from his front stoop. In his first media availability outside the home after Sophie’s positive test, Trudeau called his situation “an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating,” but he noted his family was doing the right thing by following the advice of medical professionals. Inside Rideau Cottage, domestic duties have kept the prime minister busy. Trudeau, the official said, has been preparing meals for Hadrien, Ella-Grace and Xavier, 12, using supplies left outside the door. The drop-offs have also included a box of Star Wars Legos to help preoccupy the kids. The sounds of children yelling or laughing have at times been overheard during phone discussions about “pretty serious stuff,” the official said. All meetings with staff, they added, have been conducted by phone because installing secure video links in the home where people are self-isolated was seen as a big obstacle. The phone calls have created new challenges as ministers and other officials try to follow along with charts and graphs. Key discussions have grown more complex due to the lack of body language. “You don’t see the nuance of the raised eyebrow,” they said. The official said the prime minister’s example of working from home could serve as an opportunity to “normalize” the fact that many more people may have to do the same. There are small silver linings. The proximity of Trudeau’s news conference Wednesday to his front closet came in handy. He made his major economic announcement and then he paused the live outdoor news conference, which was held on a cold late winter day. “Just before I take questions, I’m supposed to model healthy behavior, I’m going to go grab my coat and I’ll be right back,” he said before dashing into the house and returning a few seconds later. Trudeau has used his news events to urge others to work from home as much as possible. “Don’t go out unless you absolutely have to,” he said this week. “Work remotely if you can. Let the kids run around a bit in the house. Things will get better.”",Justin Trudeau: Working from home just like the rest of us,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/justin-trudeau-works-from-home-coronavirus-137898,politico
"Telehealth may be about to boom as federal officials push doctors to video chat with patients, hoping to reduce stress on hospitals preparing for a flood of coronavirus cases. The Trump administration has used the president's national emergency declaration and an emergency funding package to lift key barriers to virtual care, including rules that limited payments for telehealth visits and blocked the use of popular video messaging platforms like FaceTime over privacy concerns. Many private insurers appear to be quickly following suit, raising the prospect that remote consultation could become the new normal long after the crisis subsides. ""This will be the inflection point for telemedicine that we've never had,"" said Andrew Watson, a vice president at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Watson, a former president of the American Telemedicine Association, said the current outbreak will help prove face-to-face interactions aren't as essential as many in the medical community believe. ""Health care has always thought that was the key part of providing care, but this pandemic has shown us that we can take care of our patients remotely and we certainly have the technology to do it,"" he said. President Donald Trump, whose administration has sought to expand digital health, this week boasted telehealth had never been used ""on a scale like we're going to use."" In quick succession this week, his administration lifted restrictions that telehealth boosters have long fought against, arguing they held back much wider deployment of a technology that's been in physician rooms and hospitals for over a decade. During the coronavirus crisis, the goal is to leverage telehealth to prevent further transmission of the illness by keeping patients out of hospitals and exam rooms who don't have the virus or have much milder cases. At least temporarily, Medicare will now cover at least part of every telehealth visit, waiving a policy that barred the health care program for seniors from paying for the technology outside of rural areas and for new patients. Medicare also will allow doctors to see patients across state lines virtually to help ease demand on providers swamped by the coronavirus. Separately, federal regulators said providers can prescribe an opioid addiction treatment to new patients through the technology, temporarily green-lighting a policy the administration had been reviewing for some time. The coronavirus emergency has ""removed a lot of the red tape"" for telehealth, said Jeff Wessler, CEO of cardiology technology company Heartbeat Health. Wessler and other technologists hope the coronavirus outbreak could prove the value of virtual care to skeptics. But telehealth companies have already been slammed by a surge in demand, largely from patients worried they have coronavirus. Teladoc, one of the leading U.S. firms, said it's handled 100,000 medical visits in the past week — a 50 percent jump from its typical demand in previous weeks. Zipnosis, a software platform enabling patients and clinicians to exchange text and video messages, said daily visits jumped from 650 to more than 16,000, and it's seen over 62,000 people experiencing coronavirus symptoms in the past two weeks. There are also questions about how quickly providers, as well as patients, can scale up use of the technology. According to Medicare's most recent data, just about a quarter of 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries — less than 90,000 patients — used telehealth services in 2016. Some in recent years have urged caution about the technology, questioning whether its convenience could encourage people to use more care, driving up costs. Some researchers suggest clinicians might behave differently in virtual visits, such as inappropriately prescribing more antibiotics. Health care's use of consumer video chat platforms built by the likes of Apple and Facebook has also been hampered by privacy rules governing health information, which the Trump administration temporarily waived this week. Privacy advocates have questioned the ability of tech giants to protect sensitive health information — and those questions may become even more pressing as the health system comes to rely more on telehealth. There's bipartisan support in Congress for making many of the new federal allowances for telehealth permanent. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said he hoped the administration's short-term measures would make the case for his legislation permanently expanding Medicare's telehealth benefits. Advocates in the private sector and on Capitol Hill have also called for broader coverage of not just video visits, but also greater remote monitoring of patients through digital devices like heart-rate trackers and glucose monitors. Expanding telehealth isn't as easy as flipping on a switch. A viable telehealth program needs a reliable video chat service, webcams and training for clinicians on not just how to use the technology, but also how to make patients feel comfortable with it, said John Scott, medical director of the University of Washington's telehealth program. Telehealth providers also need to stay current on evolving federal guidelines for screening and treating coronavirus. That health system, among those hit hardest by the virus, is planning a massive expansion of telepathy capacity, aiming to conduct about 80 percent of visits virtually. Scott hopes to get each of the system's 400 primary care doctors trained on telehealth as soon as possible. Watson, the UPMC executive, said his health system's colorectal surgery clinic is now conducting all pre- and post-operational visits virtually. He plans to keep that to at least 60 percent after the coronavirus crisis because patients and staff will be used to it. For Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York City, which has seen an explosion in cases this past week, the biggest challenge to building out its telehealth program is just finding time for virtual visits. The same pool of doctors slammed with emergency room duty are also taking virtual calls, said Michelle Lin, the health system's director of performance improvement. It's also not clear to what extent commercial players are covering virtual screening, she added. There's also concern that some of the highest-risk patients, who tend to be older and have underlying health conditions, won't know how to use or access these new digital tools. Medicare chief Seema Verma at a White House briefing this week urged family members to help and for seniors to contact their doctors or the Medicare hotline.",Coronavirus response could give long-awaited jolt to telehealth,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-response-telehealth-137884,politico
"Donald Trump’s cease-fire with the press was short-lived. Days after calling news media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic “very fair” at a White House news briefing, the president on Thursday went back on the offensive, agreeing with a reporter from the right-wing outlet One America News Network that outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal were siding with Chinese government propaganda and joking that he wanted to remove 75 percent to 80 percent of the journalists in the briefing room in the name of social distancing.  The president lashed out in particular at one reporter who asked why the White House was so unprepared to implement widespread testing for the respiratory illness given Trump’s assertion earlier this week that he’d known all along the outbreak would morph into a pandemic. Trump replied that his administration was, in fact, prepared for the virus that he spent weeks dismissing as a minimal threat to Americans. “We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly,” Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker.  “I’ll tell you how prepared I was — I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was,"" he continued, pointing to the single step he has pointed to almost exclusively as evidence that his administration has adequately addressed coronavirus. ""In fact, it was your network — I believe they called me a racist because I did that. It was many of the people in the room, they called me racist and other words because I did that.”  And he used a question about whether Congress should implement some kind of social distancing measures to joke about such measures imposed on journalists in the White House briefing room. The White House recently said it would pool cameras and let fewer reporters into the room to allow an empty seat between individuals in the typically jam-packed space. “I know all of them. I don’t know if they’re sitting like you people are sitting,” Trump said about the several members of Congress who have now tested positive for coronavirus.  But pointing at the reporters in the room, Trump continued: “You’re actually sitting too close. We should probably get rid of another 75, 80 percent of you. I’ll have just two or three that I like in this room. I think that’s a great way of doing it. We figured a new way of doing it.”  “But you’re actually much too close. You two,” Trump said, circling the air in the direction of the briefing room's front row, “should leave immediately.” White House news briefings, once a daily occurrence, had gone all but extinct in the Trump administration until the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic. Briefings under past Trump press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders were particular points of contention as the president's spokespeople struggled at times to answer questions about the factual inaccuracies or odd rhetoric emanating from their boss. But daily briefings, lately anchored by the president, have returned in recent days amid the coronavirus outbreak. And until Thursday, the president had remained mostly cordial with the press as he and others at the briefing work to disseminate the administration's messaging on its coronavirus response. But during his extensive media criticisms on Friday, Trump claimed that he’d been tested for coronavirus only after a deluge of questions from the media, which followed Trump’s appearance in pictures with an aide to the Brazilian president who tested positive for the virus.  “I didn't have any symptoms and I got a test, but I got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy,” Trump told reporters Thursday, when asked about his conflicting messaging over whether people with no symptoms should seek out a test, which have been in short supply across the country. “My doctor told me don't get it, you don't need it,” Trump continued. “Everybody said you don't need it, but I had to do it because the press was going crazy. And then after I got it, they said you shouldn't have gotten it, you had no symptoms.”  Toward the end of the briefing, a correspondent for the Trump-friendly cable news outlet OAN gave the president a wider opening to go after the press, which he seized. ""It amazes me when I read the things I read,"" he began, rapping several newspapers for ""phony"" reporting on his handling of the crisis. When the reporter posited that ""major left wing news media"" had been ""siding with state propaganda"" emanating from China by criticizing his use of the term ""Chinese virus,"" Trump went on an extended riff about the ""corrupt media.""  ""I think they do — I mean, they're siding with China. They're doing things they shouldn't be doing. They're siding with many others. China is the least of it,"" Trump asserted. ""So why they're doing this, you'll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.""  Ironically, Trump singled out only The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal — three papers whose journalists China announced it would expel from the country earlier this week, a move that Trump's administration condemned.",Trump drops his coronavirus media detente,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-media-coronavirus-137692,politico
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced the text of the Republicans’ trillion-dollar proposal for the so-called “Phase 3” coronavirus stimulus package, paving the way for negotiations with Democrats to formally begin.   The centerpiece of the Senate Republican proposal — crafted with support from the White House — is a direct payment to qualified Americans of up to $1,200. Married couples could get $2,400. Taxpayers who earn more than $75,000 annually will begin to see that payment reduced by $5 for every $100 they earn over the $75,000 threshold, with those who make more than $99,000 getting nothing. Families with children would get $500 per child.  While a Treasury Department outline circulated earlier in the week had called for two payments from the IRS — one each in April and May — the Senate GOP proposal only calls for one check at this time.  The GOP plan also outlines provisions to give small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans, moves back the income tax-filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, provides numerous tax cuts for corporations, and authorizes more than $200 billion in financial support for hard-hit industries such as airlines.   McConnell said he would direct a number of Senate GOP chairmen and senior Republicans to hold talks with their Democratic counterparts, including Finance Committee Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio of Florida and Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, and White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland will also be part of the talks.  McConnell said the bipartisan discussions would begin Friday morning, and he vowed they would continue until a deal is reached.  ""These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at the member level, starting now,"" McConnell said on the floor as he introduced the 247-page proposal. ""This legislation is a significant next step. And the Senate is not going anywhere until we take action.""  Senate Democrats have outlined their own $750 billion emergency plan that would expand paid family leave, pick sick leave and unemployment insurance.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) immediately complained Democrats ""had virtually no impact"" in drafting the proposal. Schumer further faulted Republicans for giving a ""bailout for a number of industries.  ""We don't want these industries to go under, but we don't want the dollars that are put there to go to corporate executives or shareholders,"" Schumer said. ""Again, they mus go to workers first."" Schumer doesn't want companies that lay off employees to receive government aid, and he wants restrictions on stock buybacks.  Schumer noted that McConnell has refused to engage Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Democrats as well, which will make it more difficult to achieve a bicameral compromise.  Schumer and Pelosi issued a statement following release of the GOP proposal: “To earn Democratic support in the Congress, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives and laying off workers.""   McConnell has faced some opposition from Senate Republicans over the direct payments plan, although White House officials tried to dismiss those complaints as not substantial.   Yet for once, McConnell isn't controlling each aspect of crafting a major piece of legislation put together on the fly, an unusual position for him. McConnell — as good a vote counter as the Senate has ever seen — usually figures out what the goal is first, and then he steers his colleagues toward that goal. Not in this case, though.  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been the most vocal opponent, despite support for the effort - so far - from President Donald Trump, Mnuchin and other senior administration officials. Graham told Senate Republicans on Thursday that he had called Trump to lobby against the plan, adding that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) — soon to take over as White House chief of staff — agreed with him.  ""Direct payments make sense when the economy is beginning to restart. It makes no sense now cause it's just money,"" Graham told reporters. ""What I want is income, just not one check. I want you to get a check every week, not just one week.""  Graham, like some other Republicans, wants to beef up the unemployment insurance system instead, as well as boosting loans for small businesses..  ""I personally think if we're going help people we ought to direct the cash payments maybe as a supplement to unemployment, not to the people that are still working everyday,"" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). ""Just a blanket cash check to everyone in America who is making $75,000... I don't know the logic of that. I could see tying it to unemployment, maybe boosting it for people who are going be laid off for a while.""  Shelby, however, cautioned that he wasn't saying he'd vote against the proposal, just that he didn't like it.  Jim Lankford (R-Okla.) said he had a ""lot of questions of how this works, who gets and who doesn't."" Other Republicans raised similar concerns, although they were cautious in their opposition.""  But White House officials privately believe that Senate Republicans will fall in line with Trump if he pushes the cash payments proposal. A senior administration official noted Graham has already expressed his opposition to direct payments.  ""We're all going to have to vote for something that in another environment we wouldn't support,"" said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).  McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon, outlined the Republican proposal to assist small businesses by providing federally guaranteed loans; direct cash payments, as well as lending to industries such as the airlines that are hit hard by the coronavirus. In addition, Republicans are looking to get more resources for the health care system, which could be overloaded as the virus continues to spread throughout the U.S.  “Our proposal will immediately help American workers, families, and businesses,” McConnell said of the plan, known as “Phase 3.” “Yes, it will help position our economy to thrive once again after this public health menace is behind us … Fundamentally, we have to beat back this virus.”  But the package will need support from at least seven Senate Democrats if all Republicans back it. Schumer emphasized Thursday that Democrats, who have outlined their own vision, will pursue a “workers first” proposal and called for a “Marshall Plan” for the health care system. He also called for a new form of unemployment insurance.  Schumer has stayed in close touch with Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the Trump administration, about the third stimulus package, as well as Pelosi.  The minority leader also called for “four corner” negotiations between party leaders in the Senate and the House, but McConnell has shown no interest in involving the House.  In preparing the “Phase 3” package, McConnell has directed task forces to come up with proposals. Rubio and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are suggesting giving small businesses forgivable loans, which would be administered by a bank, credit union or some other type of lender.  According to a draft discussion of the small business proposal, obtained by POLITICO, the maximum small business loan the government could back would double to $10 million from $5 million through the end of the year.  McConnell emphasized earlier Thursday that the proposals are not “bailouts.”   “From small businesses to key sectors, we are not talking about so-called ‘bailouts’ for firms that made reckless decisions,” McConnell said. “Nobody is alleging a moral hazard here. None of these firms — not corner stores, not pizza parlors, not airlines — brought this on themselves.”  The third stimulus package comes after the Senate passed Wednesday a multi-billion dollar House-passed emergency aid package. While some Republicans had expressed reservations about the package's paid sick leave provisions, the final vote tally was 90-8.  House Democrats are drafting their own stimulus package with extensive financial protections — including direct monthly payments of as much as $2,000 for adults; grants and debt relief for small businesses; and measures to halt evictions and foreclosures.  Democrats would also enforce strict rules on businesses that receive federal cash, such as maintaining payroll, upholding collective bargaining rights and no stock buybacks.  Pelosi and committee leaders laid out the details of the plan — which is still taking shape — on a more than two-hour conference call on Thursday.  Separately from the economic relief measures, House Democrats are also pushing for between $120 billion and $150 billion in cash for federal agencies. Much of that would trickle down to state and local authorities, which have been struggling to meet public health and economic demands amid the outbreak.  Democrats say Congress may have no choice but to dole out the funds on the third package, instead of waiting for a fourth, because it’s unclear how much longer both chambers will be able to meet in person.

"President Donald Trump on Thursday put the onus on governors to obtain the critical equipment their states need to fight the coronavirus pandemic, telling reporters that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk” for the potentially life-saving supplies. Appearing at the daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force, the president defended his decision to invoke the Defense Production Act — which would allow the administration to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of emergency medical provisions — without actually triggering the statute. “Governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work, and they are doing a lot of this work,” Trump said. “The Federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.” The president’s remarks amounted to a rebuke of governors’ recent pleas for more robust federal intervention amid the rapidly spreading outbreak, which they warn will soon overwhelm local health care systems if hospital beds, face masks and other necessities are not soon furnished in significantly greater numbers. Trump said Thursday the administration will “help out wherever we can,” but added that the acquisition of urgent supplies “is really for the local governments, governors and people in the state, depending on the way they divide it up. And they’ll do that, and they’re doing a very good job of it.” But earlier Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., exhorted the administration to help meet the demand for equipment. Cuomo has specifically sounded the alarm over the lack of ventilators in states across the nation, warning that New York would require five or six times its current supply of the respiratory machines to treat the projected number of coronavirus patients.  “Every state is shopping for ventilators. We’re shopping for ventilators. We literally have people in China shopping for ventilators, which is one of the largest manufacturers. So this is a major problem,” Cuomo said at his daily news conference, adding that the administration “can actually play a very constructive role” under the DPA. “We’re going to need protective equipment in hospitals,” Cuomo said. “We’re going to need ventilators. And that is something that a state can’t do, but the federal government can do.” Trump announced Wednesday that he would dispatch one of the Navy’s two hospital ships to New York Harbor, while the other prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast. The vessels are equipped with 1,000 hospital beds each and are intended to relieve civilian hospitals struggling with capacity in the face of the public health crisis. The Pentagon also took several actions this week, including putting on alert 1,000 “deployable” beds from a variety of different medical units, making available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves, and distributing up to 2,000 ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday called for construction companies to donate their inventories of N95 protective masks to local hospitals and halt new mask orders, and said Thursday that the administration had “literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators that can be converted to treat patients.” He did not say where the ventilators were found.  Despite those measures, the Trump administration has not completed a comprehensive assessment to determine the full scope of supplies that will need to be ordered, according to current and former administration officials, and his invoking the DPA does not do anything to increase production of those items. Public health experts, meanwhile, have encouraged increased coordinaton between the administration and manufacturers assembling medical equipment for health care providers. “They need to receive assurances from the federal government that they will be compensated, even if health care institutions don’t end up needing the equipment,” wrote Tom Inglesby and Anita Cicero, both of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in an op-ed earlier this month. Following the White House briefing, the president traveled to FEMA headquarters in Washington to participate in a video teleconference with governors on COVID-19 response efforts. In a memo from the National Governors Association delivered to Trump and Pence ahead of the call, the states’ chief executives outlined their “top needs and priorities to be shared” with the administration. Among their list of major concerns, the governors requested that the federal government “increase access to [personal protective equipment], masks, test kits, [and] extraction kits,” and demanded “accelerating the production of life-saving equipment, such as ventilators.” They also asked for the administration to “provide guidance on [the] implementation of” the DPA.

"The number of National Guardsmen called up to deal with the coronavirus response may double by the weekend, and a top general says they may help with local law enforcement. The Pentagon, meanwhile, announced on Thursday that the administration has no plans to put Guardsmen under federal control. More than 2,000 Guardsmen have already been deployed in 27 states to respond to the pandemic, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel told reporters Thursday. After possibly doubling in days, the number could rise to tens of thousands as the crisis deepens, he said. “When there is a hurricane you can see it on a map, you have a sense of how hard the storm will hit and how long the storm will last,"" said Lengyel, who is chief of the National Guard Bureau. ""With Covid-19, it's like we have 54 separate hurricanes in every state, territory and the District of Columbia.” Hours after Lengyel spoke, Pentagon spokesperson Alyssa Farah announced that the administration plans to keep Guard troops under state control. ""The @DeptOfDefense is not considering federalization of the @USNationalGuard,"" she tweeted. ""The #COVID19 response is dynamic, but at this time Governors remain in control of their states’ National Guard forces & can request additional assistance from federal Title 10 forces through @FEMAgov."" During his briefing with reporters, Lengyel made the case for keeping the Guard units under state control. In their current state-level Title 32 status, the country's 450,000 Guardsmen can be deployed by their governor to transport medical supplies, help with drive-through testing, and assist local law enforcement with enforcing curfews and other tasks, Lengyel said. He advised against federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 — one of the options the administration had been considering — because doing so means the states would lose some of those authorities. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal government is prohibited from using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement. This limitation does not apply to the National Guard when activated by a state's governor and operating under Title 32. Louisiana state officials deployed Guardsmen in this capacity in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When under state control, Guardsmen have ""additional authorities that can assist law enforcement and they maintain their direct command and control links within their states,"" Lengyel said. This ""makes it a faster, more rapid, more efficient response for the government and the state emergency response network to use them."" The primary reason to federalize the National Guard would be in a ""World War III"" scenario where additional forces are needed rapidly to go to war ""with a major peer competitor,"" Lengyel explained. But in the case of the coronavirus, no such action is needed, which he said would cost ""billions and billions of dollars."" ""I think you can get everything you need more efficiently and more effectively if you leave them in a state status,"" Lengyel said. ""There is no need right now to have 450,000 Guardsmen on duty in any given state.""","National Guard call-ups may double by the weekend, chief says",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/national-guard-call-ups-coronavirus-137578,politico
"President Donald Trump said he will ""slash red tape like nobody has even done it before"" in a bid to get unapproved coronavirus treatments to patients faster and identify effective drugs. The president said Thursday he directed the Food and Drug Administration to ""eliminate out-of-date rules and bureaucracy so this can go forward fast"" — but he did not offer any details. Instead, Trump and top health officials highlighted steps the government has taken in recent weeks to launch clinical trials of potential coronavirus treatments. Trump's remarks came one day after he teased that an ""exciting FDA announcement"" was on the way — news that reportedly caught some in the health agency by surprise as they scrambled to finalize details, said three HHS officials. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn appeared to downplay the president's optimism about speeding up access to three drugs in particular. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" Hahn said. “We need to make sure the sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patients, at the right dosage, at the right time,” he added. “That's why it is important we have our professionals looking at these therapeutics in development.” Trump suggested certain programs that the administration could use to get experimental drugs to people quickly outside of clinical trials. One such route, known as ""Right to Try,"" was established by a 2018 law that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence supported to help people who are seriously ill and have no other treatment options. ""What we're talking about today is beyond Right to Try,"" Trump said, adding that the law ""has been a tremendous success."" But outside researchers were quick to sound the alarm. ""Wow, that is bad advice from President Trump,"" said Diana Zuckerman, a drug safety expert at the National Center for Health Research. ""Lives can be saved if red tape is cut in terms of making tests, respirators, and hospital beds more available. Making untested antivirals available is not a good strategy."" The Right to Try program allows patients to appeal directly to drugmakers to use medicines that are still being developed and tested. Bioethicists and drug policy experts argue there are other ways to help people access experimental medicine — like the FDA’s compassionate use route, also name checked by the president — and that Right to Try fuels false hope, while making it difficult to collect data on how well the drugs work. The drugmaker Gilead has provided its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to patients with coronavirus under compassionate use rules first established in 1987. The National Institutes of Health has also started a clinical trial of the drug in coronavirus patients. There is limited data available on remdesivir's effectiveness against coronavirus, Gilead spokesperson Ryan McKeel said. ""It is not approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use,"" he added. McKeel said that Gilead is in discussions with the FDA about how to move forward if clinical trial data suggest the drug helps patients with coronavirus. Trump name-checked remdesivir at Thursday's briefing, along with two drugs that have been used for decades to treat malaria. He suggested that the malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, could be effective against coronavirus. But the data on that is still sparse. Some scientists say that even if the malaria drugs work against the virus, they will need to be given during the early stages of infection to have the greatest effect. And that could prove difficult because many people are without symptoms in the first days of infection, and even those who feel ill may have trouble getting tested.  ""Any benefit without doing harm is better than nothing,"" said Barry Bloom, a global health researcher at Harvard and a former White House consultant. ""Something that prevents people from being severely ill is wonderful but unlikely to affect the epidemic unless it could be used very early on.” It is unclear how many people have been treated under the federal Right to Try law for any condition. There are at least nine publicly reported cases. The libertarian Goldwater Institute, which spearheaded efforts to pass the legislation, says at least six of those involved people who received experimental brain cancer vaccine. Goldwater this week pushed for Right to Try to be used amid the coronavirus outbreak. Others are more skeptical about the program's usefulness during the current crisis. ""A lot of these [drug] products are already being deployed through clinical trials as well as compassionate use or emergency use authorities,"" Steve Ubl, CEO of the drug lobby PhRMA, said Wednesday when asked about the Right to Try push. ""I'll leave it at that."" Bioethicists were quick to sound the alarm when Goldwater floated the idea, arguing it would fuel false claims and panic around the outbreak. “Right now, to push the Right to Try pathway seems really irresponsible and dangerous,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a bioethicist at University of Pennsylvania. “This is the type of thing that's critically important to preserve clinical trials for or we’re not going to be able to figure out whether this stuff works.” Trump has urged manufacturers to get treatments and vaccines to patients quickly even as other officials have warned that creating an effective vaccine, in particular, will take at least a year. The FDA this week also let researchers alter clinical trials to keep subjects safe during the outbreak and allow for scientists to assess patients remotely. Hahn instead appeared to lean on compassionate use rather than the newer Right to Try law. ""The important thing about compassionate use — and that's what the president meant [with] this is beyond Right to Try — is that we get to collect the information,"" he said. “At this point, the issues that we have been raising with the administration have been focused more on logistics and ensuring that we online to have the free flow of goods to make sure that we can meet patient needs,” PhRMA’s Ubl told reporters Wednesday when asked about the lobby’s goals amid the government’s response.

"Weeks before President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, Sen. Richard Burr privately offered a grim prognosis for the outbreak while previewing some of the massive disruptions soon to come, according to a previously unreported recording obtained by NPR.  In the recording, which NPR reports came from the North Carolina Republican's remarks at a private luncheon late last month, Burr said that the COVID-19 outbreak ""is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic,"" which killed an estimated 50 million worldwide.  ""There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,"" said Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr also authored the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the 2006 law that formulated the federal response to outbreaks. In his comments to the Tar Heel Circle in North Carolina on Feb. 27, Burr gave attendees a chilling warning about the severity of the coronavirus at a time when there were only a little over a dozen reported confirmed cases in the U.S. and President Donald Trump was suggesting that number would drop down to zero in short order. Burr, too, had publicly declared confidence in the U.S. preparations for coronavirus, despite his darker assessment to the Tar Heel Circle. Those public declarations of confidence were featured in a separate ProPublica report on Thursday indicating that Burr — who has access to regular intelligence briefings — sold between $580,000 and $1.6 million in stock in the weeks before the market began to collapse under the strain of coronavirus. That decision probably spared Burr severe financial pain. Progressive groups quickly called for an investigation and even demanded that Burr step down. “As Intel chairman, @SenatorBurr got private briefings about Coronavirus weeks ago,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). “Burr knew how bad it would be. He told the truth to his wealthy donors, while assuring the public that we were fine. THEN he sold off $1.6 million in stock before the fall. He needs to resign.“ A spokesperson for the senator quickly rebutted the notion that anything improper had happened, noting that Burr‘s stock sale came before the market began to show signs of strain. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,“ the aide said. “As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy. He supported Congress’ immediate efforts to provide $7.8 billion for response efforts and this week’s bipartisan bill to provide relief for American business and small families.” Burr also responded sharply to the NPR report about his private remarks, calling it a “tabloid-style hit piece.“ He said the story left the impression that Americans weren‘t properly warned of the dire potential effects of coronavirus, and he said that impression was incorrect. But Burr‘s backup for that was a Feb. 26 news conference in which Trump, alongside public health officials, sharply downplayed the risk of coronavirus, saying numbers in the U.S. were going “down, not up,“ and suggesting schools take precautions for a scenario that he considered unlikely to unfold. That was in sharp contrast to Burr‘s message to the North Carolina group a day later.  Burr instructed attendees to reconsider traveling to Europe, a suggestion that came about two weeks before the president announced a travel ban for foreigners coming to the U.S. from most of Europe. ""You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference. Why risk it?"" he asked the group. The senator also said that the virus could prompt the shuttering of schools, something that happened in his home state a couple of weeks later.  “There will be, I'm sure, times that communities, probably some in North Carolina, have a transmission rate where they say, let's close schools for two weeks, everybody stay home,” he says in the recording. Burr even forecast the mobilization of the military, something that has only begun to happen in recent days on a wider scale. ""We're going to send a military hospital there, it's going to be in tents and going to be set up on the ground somewhere,"" he predicted, noting that ""It's going to be a decision the president and DoD make. And we're going to have medical professionals supplemented by local staff to treat the people that need treatment.”  Burr's tone in private went well beyond an op-ed he co-authored with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), reassuring Americans that although they were rightfully concerned about the outbreak, it was being properly handled by the authorities. ""Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump administration,"" the two senators wrote. ""The work of Congress and the administration has allowed U.S. public health officials to move swiftly and decisively in the last few weeks."" The Trump administration has faced fierce criticism for not taking the outbreak seriously enough at its outset and for fumbling the early testing process — issues the White House is still scrambling to address.  There are now more than 9,000 reported cases in the U.S., and Americans have been advised to ""hunker down"" in an attempt to contain the spread of more infections.",Recording shows Senate intel chair warned of coronavirus disruption in private weeks ahead of time,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/senate-intel-chair-warned-of-coronavirus-disruption-in-private-137407,politico
"Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday that she would end her presidential campaign, formally winnowing the 2020 Democratic field to a two-man race between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Today, I’m suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to Vice President Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,” Gabbard said in a video statement posted online. In endorsing Biden, Gabbard said that “although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he’s motivated by his love for our country and the American people.” “I’m confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha, respect and compassion, and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart,” she added. Gabbard closely tied the reasons for her withdrawal from the race to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying that “the best way that I can be of service at this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and to stand ready to serve in uniform should the Hawaii National Guard be activated.”  Gabbard previously served two tours in the Middle East with the Hawaii Army National Guard — in Iraq from 2004-2005 and in Kuwait from 2008-2009 — and stepped away from her campaign in August to report for active duty, participating in a two-week joint training exercise in Indonesia. Apart from Biden and Sanders, Gabbard outlasted all of her Democratic rivals to become the third remaining White House hopeful in what began as a historically diverse and crowded pack of candidates.  The Hawaii lawmaker faced significant criticism for her seemingly quixotic decision to stay in the race beyond the early nominating contests, and now finishes her campaign with only two pledged delegates — less than several of her former rivals who dropped out weeks ago. But Gabbard, long a controversial figure within the Democratic field, had little to lose after declaring in October that she would not seek reelection to a fifth term in Congress, a prospect complicated by a formidable primary challenger and thorny relationships with other Hawaii politicians. She had also become the subject of widespread skepticism among national Democrats, often rebuked for her past anti-LGBT rhetoric, isolationist brand of diplomacy and 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom she declined to label a war criminal despite the dictator’s use of chemical weapons to attack his own people. Gabbard typically polled better with independents than self-identified Democrats, and acquired some support from fringe conservatives. She was frequently referenced in Russian media and propaganda, prompting a high-profile clash with Hillary Clinton after the 2016 Democratic nominee claimed the congresswoman was the “favorite” of Moscow. Although Gabbard’s last appearance in a primary debate was in November, before the Democratic National Committee raised its bar to participate, she emerged as a fiery on-stage presence — blasting other candidates for their records and proposals on foreign policy, criminal justice and the impeachment of President Donald Trump, among other issues.  Her exit from the race Thursday after weeks of defying political pressure to drop out reflects the new nature of the Democratic primary, which has become frozen in place amid the COVID-19 outbreak and seen Biden mount a nearly insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders. The senator’s campaign manager announced Wednesday he would “assess” the state of his White House bid in the days ahead.","Tulsi Gabbard ends White House bid, endorses Biden",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/tulsi-gabbard-ends-white-house-bid-137242,politico
"The State Department on Thursday issued an extraordinary advisory urging Americans not to travel overseas and to return to the United States if they can, a move that comes amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The Level 4 travel advisory for all international travel appears to be unprecedented and is the most severe such warning issued by the department. It urges American citizens who live abroad or otherwise cannot reach the U.S. to essentially stay where they are and avoid crossing international boundaries. POLITICO first reported the plans for the advisory earlier Thursday. Numerous U.S. citizens are already in limbo abroad, and the new guidance threatens to stir further anxiety among travelers. U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about the State Department’s ability to aid Americans overseas, but in the new guidance, the department makes clear that U.S. citizens shouldn’t count on it to help. “Have a travel plan that does not rely on the U.S. government for assistance,” the travel advisory tells Americans who decide to go overseas or are already there. According to several people familiar with the situation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo approved raising the advisory from its previous status of Level 3. That earlier advisory merely encouraged Americans to reconsider travel abroad.  The State Department press office did not respond to requests for comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. Current and former U.S. State Department officials, some of them with several decades of experience, said they did not recall such a travel advisory ever being issued in the past. The highly unusual guidance came after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, following President Donald Trump's move to limit travel from China at the end of January.  Other countries have closed their borders and imposed further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C.  The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. The advisory acknowledged the difficult conditions, noting, for instance: “Many countries are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice.“  Some Americans are stranded in countries such as  Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville.  She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned.  “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO.  The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information. It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Members of Congress said they’re trying to handle pleas for help from constituents and have been pushing the State Department to figure out how to get Americans home. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from 9 Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help those stuck abroad. “We seek an immediate clarification regarding your current efforts to facilitate the return of Americans to the United States, whether by commercial airline flights, charter flights, or other means,” the letter reads. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner also reached out to Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. His spokesperson, Nelly Decker, said that the Virginia Democrat’s office was assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.""","State Department warns Americans: Don’t travel abroad, come home if overseas",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-travel-advisory-level-four-137227,politico
"The Democratic National Committee raised $12.8 million in February through its main account and a joint fundraising committee with state parties, according to numbers shared first with POLITICO. The total shows an improvement for the DNC as the committee gears up for the high-stakes 2020 election. In 2019, the committee and the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, which can take in six-figure checks from donors and divide them between the DNC and numerous state parties, regularly raised less than $10 million per month. The DNC finished February with $14 million cash on hand, it said. But the committee has a challenging road ahead: Democrats are slowly emerging from a long primary — and Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, will need to quickly build a large campaign machine if he wants to catch up with President Donald Trump, who has had months to prepare his reelection effort. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee has been raking in money for years under Trump, and the DNC’s total is likely much less than the RNC’s February haul. Though the RNC hasn't yet disclosed its individual fundraising total, it raised $27.1 million in January, and it said earlier this month that the RNC and Trump’s campaign raised a combined $86 million in February. The coronavirus outbreak creates even greater fundraising challenges for the DNC and campaigns across the board.

"It’s been nearly a month since governors first called on the federal government to help provide testing so states could monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus. They’re still waiting. And without knowing who's ill and where, they can't realistically slow the pandemic. While President Donald Trump is touting a dramatic uptick in testing across the country, governors and public health officials say they are still being forced to dramatically ration the tests, while labs are confronting daunting backlogs that delay the results. “I watch a news conference and they tell us we have testing capacity, but I am telling you we don’t have testing capacity. It is not out there yet,” said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a Wednesday news conference. His state has a current backlog of 1,700 samples waiting to be processed. Walz blames the Trump administration’s decision to prioritize 14 of the nation’s hardest-hit areas, supplying them with needed material and leaving the rest of the nation to scramble. “The minute they made that decision … our supply chain of reagents for our testing were dried up,” he said. Even as President Donald Trump calls on states to do more and says the federal government is not “a shipping clerk,” governors have been on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence and other federal officials, begging for additional supplies, testing kits, swabs, reagents and protective equipment. “I think it’s critical the feds move a lot faster on this stuff,” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said on Wednesday. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said his state is “critically low” on test kits and that he has been pushing the federal government for help. The shortage of tests means that in many states people who believe they might have contracted the virus can’t know for sure and are told to stay home for weeks. It means health care workers don’t know whether they've contracted the illness even as they treat infected patients and tend to members of high-risk groups, such as the elderly, who might be in the hospital for other reasons. And it means public health officials are left guessing where they should direct resources because they can’t be certain whether there are clusters of cases. Trump on Thursday insisted that governors have all they need, telling reporters he was hearing “very good things on the ground.” “I can tell you what we’re doing is working with local governors to get them what they want,” Trump said. But the president’s words don’t match reality, state and local officials say. “We’re the boots on the ground. We know what's available,” said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease division director for the Minnesota Health Department. “Some of the commercial labs do not have the materials they need.” That’s left states to impose strict criteria on who can be tested, frustrating people across the country who are showing symptoms, worried but were told to wait and see if their cases worsen. In several states, only those who are hospitalized or at high risk, including those with underlying conditions, can be tested. “Most individuals with mild symptoms do not need to be tested even with expanded testing options,” Indiana State Health Commissioner Kristina Box said during a news conference on Thursday. She added even though commercial labs were scaling up testing capacity in the state, they will still have to limit who is getting the tests. “We still have a shortage of supplies and we need to be mindful of that.” Shortages and testing backlogs continue to be reported across the country. In Eagle County, Colo., where state officials have reported a cluster of cases, the local hospital, Vail Health, confirmed at least 400 people are waiting to be tested. White House officials have sent mixed messages, telling states and Congress that supplies were on their way while acknowledging those supplies still might fall short. Last week, NIH infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci lamented to lawmakers that the testing effort to date was “a failing,” and CDC Director Robert Redfield told POLITICO he was not confident the U.S. has sufficient supplies of materials needed to prepare samples for testing. Still, Trump repeatedly assured governors that supplies were on the way. Meanwhile, the days have turned to weeks, and the shortages persist. “I feel a little like Charlie Brown and Lucy with the football with the federal government,” said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The Trump administration on Sunday announced it was teaming with Walmart to provide drive-thru testing in the giant chain’s parking lots, though it is unclear when those testing sites will be ready. Some state officials said they hadn’t received guidance from the administration on those plans and were unclear how they would fit into their broader testing work. They also had concerns about exhausting already limited supplies. “There hasn't been specific messaging to state public health folks about this,” said Minnesota’s Ehresmann, adding that her department found out about the announcement during the White House news conference. “It remains to be seen how that will impact things.” The American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents commercial labs, reported Wednesday night that its members had completed approximately 43,000 tests to date. That number is up from 27,000 tests on Tuesday — indicating private testing is starting to ramp up, in part due to diagnostic companies like Hologic and Thermo Fisher gaining emergency use authorization from FDA. But private labs are still not meeting demand. ACLA President Julie Khani pressed congressional leaders in a Wednesday letter to establish an “emergency laboratory surge capacity fund of $5 billion” to help labs cover coronavirus testing costs like child care for lab workers and products in short supply, such as swabs and personal protective equipment. States looking to lean on private labs for quick testing results might be disappointed. Quest Diagnostics, which is conducting testing in Marlborough, Mass.; Chantilly, Va.; and San Juan Capistrano, Calif., says it expects patients and providers to get testing results within three to four days of specimen pickup. But a company spokesperson told POLITICO that the timing could slip due to high demand. States that are waiting on reagents or other supplies from the CDC are trying to use workarounds to keep up testing capacity in their public health labs, but it is increasingly challenging. “We're getting reagents wherever we can get them,” Ehresmann said. “The bottom line is our lab has been using several different testing methodologies in an attempt to maximize the testing we can do, and if the supplies for that are running out, we move to the next methodology. We’re constantly trying to keep things moving.” Rob Davidson, an emergency room physician in Michigan and the executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare, said the lack of testing combined with a critical need for manpower leaves patients at risk. Doctors are being told to keep working until they have a fever, even if they are exposed to a patient with the virus. They are being told to use one mask per shift unless it becomes soiled. But because of the lack of testing, there is no way to know whether a doctor contracts the virus until it’s too late. “For God’s sake, just get us more tests,” he said.",States still waiting on coronavirus tests as Trump tells them to do more,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-tests-states-138426,politico
"The coronavirus is exposing potential flaws in America’s financial regulatory system, a decade after a massive overhaul was designed to prevent the next crisis. While U.S. banks have much stronger balance sheets than they did during the 2008 financial crisis, some of the reforms in the so-called Dodd-Frank law passed in 2010 did not anticipate that a devastating pandemic would virtually shut down the global economy. Here’s just one example of the limits of the law: The Federal Reserve is no longer allowed to bail out individual companies, which some argue may hamper the central bank’s power to help mission-critical institutions. On top of that, in recent years the Trump administration and Congress have relaxed regulations, including rules establishing financial cushions that banks must have to support their business and quickly turn assets into cash in a crisis. Many of those decisions from the past decade may make the U.S. more vulnerable than anyone realized. The key things to watch will be whether the nation's banks can follow through on a pledge to keep lending during the meltdown and if risky financial activities that escaped Dodd-Frank's hammer will turn out to have been worthy of greater oversight after all. ""It could all catch up to us,"" said Amanda Fischer, a former aide to the top Democrats on the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees who now directs policy at a think tank. ""The Coronavirus will expose whether our financial system is resilient or fragile in the face of a severe shock."" Much of the Dodd-Frank law was built around bank solvency, because the lenders were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis. But any coronavirus financial crash threatens to extend to all corners of the economy, including essential services like transportation and medical supplies, and the U.S. government may not have the tools to creatively solve a 2020 problem using a law designed to prevent the 2008 crisis. As the coronavirus panic unfolded, the Trump administration was among the first to second-guess lawmakers' post-crisis restrictions on regulators' bailout authority. While the 2008 meltdown spurred Congress to give agencies many new ways to intervene in the financial system, a political backlash — from Republicans as well as many Democrats — over the rescue of Wall Street banks spurred lawmakers to impose new hurdles if regulators were compelled again to save firms from collapse. Congress limited the Federal Reserve's authority to provide emergency lending to individual companies outside the banking industry, as it had done with the giant insurer American International Group in 2008. Lawmakers also restricted Treasury's ability to guarantee money market mutual funds as it did during the crisis. Dodd-Frank called for the Fed's emergency lending power to be used on a broad basis for several firms at once, not to bail out a single insolvent company. And the central bank would have to seek the Treasury secretary's approval for emergency lending going forward. The restrictions have come to the fore as the Trump administration scrambles for ways to prop up ailing companies, including airlines. ""I am in daily conversations with [Fed Chairman] Jay Powell,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a Fox News interview Sunday. ""We are looking at the tools we have, and they are looking at the tools they have. Certain tools were taken away from both of us after the financial crisis with Dodd-Frank. If we need more tools, we will go back to Congress and get bipartisan support to get that."" Mnuchin's not alone. Hal Scott, who has advocated for financial industry deregulation as director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, argued in The Wall Street Journal that Congress should restore all the powers it took away from the Fed, as well as the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ""Bold action can prevent a panic before it starts,"" he said. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh called on the Fed to invoke its emergency powers to create a new credit facility to ensure businesses and households have access to cash, a move that could benefit airlines, retailers and energy companies hit by the economic shutdown — not just banks and financial institutions. But if congressional authority is needed to arm the Fed with new bailout powers to rescue failing corporations, expect resistance from lawmakers and howls from Wall Street watchdogs. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and progressive advocates are already warning that any bailouts of big business should be accompanied by higher wages for workers and restrictions on payouts to investors. ""Let me be clear: We're not doing no-strings-attached bailouts that enrich shareholders or pay CEO bonuses,"" Warren said Tuesday. ""Period."" Powell himself said Sunday that the Fed had not made the decision to request further authority from Congress. Fischer, who is policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, said the Fed's emergency lending power isn't that constrained. ""The Fed will do what it takes in a downturn to stabilize the financial sector,"" she said. ""Who has standing to sue them to undo it? No one would sue them, no one would challenge them."" Unlike 2008, the banking industry does not appear to be in dire need of a government rescue. How long the industry remains on solid footing will depend on how effectively lawmakers and regulators shored up the banking system over the past decade. Bank CEOs, including Brian Moynihan of Bank of America and Michael Corbat of Citigroup, visited President Donald Trump at the White House on March 11 and repeatedly stressed that their banks are well-capitalized and ready to make loans to businesses and help struggling consumers. But an economy veering toward a recession will test whether the banks' buffers will be enough to help them follow through on those promises. The banks are facing major pressure on their margins from rock-bottom interest rates and will have to deal with borrowers unable to pay back loans. The implementation of the past decade's banking safeguards was a constant lobbying fight, with regulators, banks and consumer groups battling over what constituted adequate capital and liquidity. In 2018, Republicans and moderate Democrats enacted legislation that further eased some of those rules. ""We may have to find out there's well-capitalized for regulatory purposes and then there's well-capitalized in practice — for lending purposes and market purposes,"" said Graham Steele, director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a former aide to Senate Banking Committee ranking member Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). ""That's the one tension I'm worried about."" In addition to shoring up the internal operations of the banks themselves, regulators have spent the past several years implementing new powers to oversee a broader set of potential risks in the financial system. One of Dodd-Frank's biggest changes to Wall Street oversight was to regulate derivatives contracts known as swaps that financial firms and nonfinancial firms enter into to hedge risk and place speculative bets. Lawmakers imposed new regulations on the market after uncertainty about derivatives positions led to the near-failure and subsequent bailout of AIG in 2008. The weeks and months to come will pose a major test for the market's primary regulator — the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — and its ability to keep tabs on potential risks that might be building. It has struggled since taking on the new derivatives mandate because of budget cuts imposed by Congress. The CFTC now receives trading data on the swaps market but the agency still doesn't have complete awareness of everything going on, said Justin Slaughter, a former commission official and ex-Senate aide who's now a consultant at Mercury Strategies. ""We’re no longer flying blind, but I wouldn’t say the CFTC has got a truly clear window into what’s going on in real time,"" he said. ""It might be more accurate to say we’re flying with one eye open."" One of the most powerful entities Congress created in 2010 was the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The council, tasked with identifying systemic risks, includes the heads of the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, FDIC and CFTC. It was empowered not only as a convening body, but also with the power to place ""systemically important"" financial firms under the Fed's oversight and to pressure individual regulatory agencies to implement new rules. Trump's appointees have signaled that they have no intention of using the power to subject new financial institutions to Fed oversight. Coronavirus is the biggest crisis the group has faced yet. Since the pandemic exploded, the council has been quiet. It's scheduled to meet March 23, and lawmakers are now pressing the council to act. ""FSOC does not inspire a lot of confidence,"" Fischer said. ""It's interesting to me the president has taken such a market-centered approach to the pandemic. He's met with Wall Street CEOs. That's clearly the focus of his attention. But there's not been similar attention paid by regulators to market stability.""",The 2008 financial crisis did not prepare us for the 2020 coronavirus crisis,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/2008-financial-crisis-coronavirus-138263,politico

"Coronavirus is starting to drain money from the expensive world of political campaigning.  Campaigns across the country have canceled face-to-face fundraisers for the foreseeable future and are scrambling to figure out how to raise enough money to stay solvent. Big donors' stock portfolios are tanking. And small-dollar, online contributors — who have never been more important to campaigns — are facing sudden financial uncertainty and the real possibility of unemployment.  The severe economic shock from coronavirus could upend the 2020 election. And Democrats see themselves as having more to lose: President Donald Trump bungled the early days of the coronavirus crisis, they say, and while that could cost him politically, the tanking economy will hurt Democrats’ ability to raise the money challengers need to campaign for the White House and other offices in 2020. Trump’s well-stocked reelection campaign has less to lose amid the current financial uncertainty than does Joe Biden, who is emerging from a costly primary, they argue. Major donors from both parties already are beginning to scale back after years of riding high off of a booming stock market, donors and fundraisers told POLITICO.  ""I’m personally postponing anything where more than two people need to get together until we have an understanding of what the dangers are. And in terms of spending money, I’m trying to cut back as much as possible,"" said Democratic megadonor and philanthropist Bernard Schwartz, who has given at least $2.8 million to Democratic causes this cycle, including helping a pro-Biden super PAC.  Biden and Trump are starting to work donors via the phone and video meetups, while anxiety rattles through congressional campaigns and some organizations grow nervous about whether they will be able to stay in the black.  It won't take long until campaigns feel the sting, said Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, which supports down-ballot candidates.  ""I think the thing people don’t realize is that campaigns and organizations — both political and nonprofits — don’t keep that much cash on hand,"" Litman said. ""You’re running month to month. One bad month, you can make it through. Two or three, and it can be catastrophic."" Run for Something has canceled events through mid-June, which Litman estimated will cost the group $450,000, approximately 25 percent of its budget for the year. Both Trump and Biden, who is just beginning to gear up for a general election as the coronavirus rocks the United States, are trying to keep growing their campaigns. And the committees and campaigns associated with House and Senate candidates have canceled almost all upcoming events, they told POLITICO. “Safety is more important than fundraisers or negative ads,” Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “In-person fundraisers have been canceled and that will affect our bottom line. And we couldn't care less.” “This decision will cost us money,” Scott Fairchild, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote in an email to online donors explaining the committee was canceling all events. “A large chunk of our fundraising is going to dry up. And to compensate for this shortfall, our Democratic Senate campaigns will need the support of this online community more than ever.” Trump’s campaign has canceled a slew of events, including a pair of highly anticipated fundraisers featuring Melania Trump — her first for the reelection campaign — this week in Beverly Hills and next week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump also last week canceled a trip to Las Vegas for a fundraiser hosted by casino mogul and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “Trump’s fundraising juggernaut is certainly going to slow a bit as the country focuses on survival,” said Republican donor Dan Eberhart. “It may not be evident today, but campaign fundraising is certain to take a hit like every other sector of the economy. There is too much uncertainty for large and small donors alike.” Both Trump and Biden will keep raising money online and via “virtual fundraisers,” held most often through video conferences with donors. Biden has one such virtual event scheduled for Friday. (The transition hasn’t always been easy: The Biden campaign postponed one such event scheduled for this week in New York City amid technical difficulties, CNBC reported.) Earlier this week, the Biden campaign distributed a fresh list of incentives to its top fundraisers to try to keep money flowing in: perks for bundlers who raise $25,000 to $500,000 for the campaign. A fundraiser who raises $25,000 for Biden, known as an “Advocate,” gets “direct contact with Regional Finance Director” and “Inclusion in national leadership councils.” People who raise more money for the campaign — including the $250,000 “Scranton Circle” and the $500,000 “Philly Founder” — receive more perks, including “bi-weekly update calls with campaign leadership” and invitations to quarterly and annual finance committee events. “It may become more 'social distancing' or more draconian down the road, then eventually people will realize we need to move forward with the campaigns as well. Some of that means resources,” said John Atkinson, a Chicago-based bundler for Biden. Meanwhile, some big-name Democrats expected to spend huge sums on 2020, including Silicon Valley investor Ron Conway and businessman Mike Bloomberg, have turned their attention to combating coronavirus. Neither Conway, nor Bloomberg has announced plans to scale back on politics, but to some, the 2020 election suddenly seems like a more distant priority than a few months ago. Todd Schulte, president of the Mark Zuckerberg-backed FWD.us, implored lawmakers to use their small-dollar donor lists for advocacy instead of fundraising in an email to supporters about helping with coronavirus, obtained by POLITICO.  “Use your email lists,” Schulte wrote. “I don’t think I got a single email saying call X member and demand ‘more kits everywhere, mass investment in medical capacity, $1000 to every American, mandatory sick leave, and more.’ No one is going to give much online -- to you or your opponent,” Schulte wrote. Some candidates are letting their small-dollar donors off the hook. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn) included a note to donors about the financial toll the emergency is taking in fundraising emails. “It’s okay not to donate right now,” one email from Smith read. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is now running for Senate, and MJ Hegar, a Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, gave donors the ability to temporarily opt out of fundraising emails during the emergency. Not every candidate, though, has abandoned raising money in person.  GOP fundraiser Alexandra Kendrick said that while the vast majority of her clients have canceled fundraisers — including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was slated to host a weekend donor retreat in Napa next weekend — two candidate clients are currently planning on going forward with their events. “If it’s me and them sitting at a table with a chicken sandwich, so be it,” Kendrick said. “It’s not about the money, I think. It’s about the routine for them.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report.",Coronavirus shock slams campaign fundraising,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-campaign-fundraising-138381,politico
"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown America’s electoral system into shock, prompting officials in six states so far to move presidential primaries as the federal government urges people not to gather in large groups. Connecticut became the latest state to push back its vote on Thursday, and even more states are considering delays. Meanwhile, election officials are also gaming out the changes they can make to voting systems to allow Americans to participate in elections while keeping themselves safe and preventing the spread of the virus. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has urged states not to postpone their primaries and instead embrace expanded voting by mail. But Perez has little authority over how individual states conduct their elections. 23 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and other territories have yet to vote in the presidential contest, and we are tracking developments in every one as the calendar shifts and states puzzle through when — and how — people can vote. Here’s what has happened so far in all the states that were scheduled to vote from mid-March through the end of April. Connecticut (moved from April 28 to June 2) Gov. Ned Lamont announced on March 19 that the state’s primary would be moved to June 2. “In coordination with other states and our Secretary of the State, and in an effort to carry out Democracy while keeping public health a top priority, I have decided to move our presidential primary to June 2nd,” Lamont tweeted. Connecticut law only allows voters to cast ballots by mail with a valid excuse, but Secretary of the State Denise Merrill also said avoiding coronavirus is now a valid excuse for absentee voting in the state. “Secretary Merrill has determined that for reasons of public health, absentee ballots that are requested to avoid public gatherings at polling places are requested because of illness, and should be validly issued,” a statement from her office on March 13 read. Georgia (moved from March 24 to May 19) Georgia was one of the first states to postpone its primary, moving it to May 19. “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement on March 14. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices. Louisiana (moved from April 4 to June 20) Louisiana also postponed its presidential primary, delaying its election until June 20. Notably, Louisiana's new date moves the primary outside of the nominating contest window set by the Democratic National Committee, meaning the state could have its number of delegates cut unless the DNC changes or waives its current rules. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement on March 13. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" Kentucky (moved from May 19 to June 23) Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear jointly agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement.  Maryland (moved from April 28 to June 2) Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan postponed the state’s primaries to June 2 in response to the coronavirus. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said at a March 17 press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process in our state.” One election will still be held on April 28 in the state: The special election in Maryland’s 7th District to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. That election will be mail-in only, and it could be an important test: Activists and some politicians are pushing for mail-in elections to be more widely adopted nationwide as part of the response to the coronavirus outbreak. Ohio (delayed from March 17 to June 2) Ohio was supposed to hold its primary on March 17. But Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration backed a court case to delay the election for public health reasons the day prior, and after a judge ruled the primary should go on, DeWine and his public health director shut down polling places due to a “health emergency.” Following the closure, Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying the primary was postponed until June 2 and prohibiting county election authorities “from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. But that doesn’t mean June 2 is set in stone. Ohio’s state legislature is set to meet starting on March 24 to take action on the primary, The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported, with leaders noting that they have the power to set election details. ""The legal authority to change the date rests with the Ohio General Assembly,"" House Speaker Larry Householder wrote in a memo. ""No Ohio voter should ever wonder when they will have the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote."" Meanwhile, the Ohio Democratic Party filed a lawsuit over the move, looking for clarity for the new primary: “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election. So authority for a new election must come from the legislature or from a court,” party chair David Pepper said. The party’s lawsuit, effectively, asks for a mail-in primary through April 28. Wyoming (April 4) The Wyoming Democratic Party canceled the in-person portion of their caucuses in response to coronavirus. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Alaska (April 4) Alaska Democrats have not made changes to their party-run primary, which already had a significant mail-in component already. Alaska voters who were registered as Democrats by Feb. 18 had ballots mailed to them that need to be postmarked by March 24, with in-person voting scheduled for April 4. A spokesperson for the state party told POLITICO that the party was “currently in the process of reaccessing” the procedure and said changes were coming soon. Delaware (April 28) Delaware is, for now, continuing on as planned with its election.  “Governor [John] Carney's team is working closely with Elections Commissioner [Anthony] Albence, and we are continuing to move forward with planning, for now,” Carney spokesperson Jon Starkey wrote in an email to POLITICO. “We will continue to move forward — with plans to take additional health precautions to keep Delawareans healthy — until guidance from our public health experts makes clear we cannot safely hold the election on April 28.” Hawaii (April 4) A statement on Hawaii’s office of elections’ website8 says there are “no changes to the 2020 [e]lection schedule at this time.” However, Hawaii conducts its elections largely by mail already, so it may be able to continue as usual without significant disruption. New York (April 28) Discussions about moving New York’s primary have begun, but there is nothing definitive yet. Douglas A. Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, told The New York Times on March 15 that the presidential primary could move to June 23 (the date of other primaries in the state), but that decision would have to be made by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature. But Cuomo said he has not given any thought to the idea yet. “I have virtually no political thoughts at this time and no thought about postponing an election,” he said at a March 17 press conference. However, Cuomo has already delayed all village elections in New York until April 28. “Public health officials have been clear that reducing density is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread, and delaying village elections will help ensure poll workers and voters are not potentially exposed to the virus and at the same time maintain integrity in our election system,” he said in a statement on March 16. Pennsylvania (April 28) Gov. Tom Wolf said the state is considering moving its primary. “I’m not sure what impact it’s going to have on the primary,"" Wolf said at a press conference on March 16. “Obviously, we want to keep people safe, so to the extent that the state needs to move the April 28 date to another date, other states have already done this, Pennsylvania is certainly taking that into consideration.” However, it is not entirely clear if Wolf has the authority to do so on his own. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the clearest way to move the primary would be for the state legislature to do that — but there’s no consensus among lawmakers. Wolf may be able to use his emergency powers to move the primary. Puerto Rico (March 29) Puerto Rico is on the verge of rescheduling its primary. At the request of the island’s Democratic Party, the Puerto Rico Senate passed a resolution on March 16 pushing the primary until April 26, with the potential to further postpone the primary at a later date if the emergency persists. A statement from the party on March 16 said the Puerto Rico House of Representatives is expected to also pass the bill, and Gov. Wanda Vazquez has indicated she will sign the bill. Rhode Island (April 28) Election officials in the state are split on what to do. The state board of elections voted on March 17 to ask Gov. Gina Raimondo to postpone the presidential primary from April 28 to June 2 — but Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea’s office is recommending the April 28 primary stay in place as a “predominantly mail-ballot” election. The governor’s office told the Associated Press that Raimondo was “open to the idea” of moving the primary following the board’s vote. Wisconsin (April 7) Wisconsin is in a tougher situation than other states: Not only is the presidential primary scheduled for April 7, but so are general elections for state and local offices, including state Supreme Court and mayor of Milwaukee. Gov. Tony Evers has beaten back calls to postpone the election. ""How long do we potentially leave offices unfilled because we’re into July or August and we haven’t held a general election?"" he asked reporters on a conference call on March 17, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Evers has urged voters to vote absentee. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Democratic Party and the DNC have filed a lawsuit to expand voting access. The suit seeks to extend electronic and mail registration to April 3, axe photo ID and residency document requirements for absentee ballot and registration requests, and extend the mail-in deadline to count votes postmarked by Election Day and received within 10 days of the election. Mark Jefferson, the chair of the state GOP, put out a statement: “The best course of action during elections in times of crisis is to ensure equal access to the polls, not to suspend all common-sense regulations that ensure fair elections in a democracy,” he said. “We call on local election officials to make early-voting available immediately and we are exploring what legal options may be available. Suspending rules that ensure fair elections is simply not an acceptable solution.” Alice Miranda Ollstein and Elena Schneider contributed reporting.",Everything to know about states moving and changing their primaries over coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/state-elections-primaries-changes-coronavirus-138393,politico
"Washington is poised to blast more than $1 trillion into the U.S. economy to help offset the devastating effects of the coronavirus, which has locked down much of the nation and rocked businesses large and small. It might not be nearly enough. As forecasts darken with estimates for huge spikes in unemployment and sharp drops in economic growth, economists and Wall Street analysts are warning that even the huge stimulus package now under consideration on Capitol Hill may only make a small dent. Some suggest the number needs to be at least $2 trillion or perhaps far more. “They should be doing much more than they are thinking about and doing it much quicker, at least $2 trillion with the promise of more to come,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We have whole industries like the restaurant industry that have been obliterated already. Jobless claims next week could be two or three million.” Shepherdson added that “we could see a drop of 5 million jobs in April. We are going to see numbers we never thought possible. This will be the biggest economic hit that any developed economy has ever seen outside wartime.” Calls for much bigger stimulus are coming from across the partisan spectrum. Former Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Narayana Kocherlakota has suggested a package of at least $2.5 trillion. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed at least $2 trillion. Former White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci, who has broken with the administration, suggested the current package was far too small. He’s calling for more than $3 trillion. “This is literally like a combo of 9/11, the global financial crisis and an invasion of every nation’s homeland,” he said Thursday on CNN. “$1 trillion is six weeks’ worth of firepower. We need six months’ worth of firepower.” The reason so many want to see bigger numbers is mostly just simple math. “$1.2 trillion in pure terms is going to cover about two to three weeks of economic activity,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. “So if this were going to last just that long, $1 trillion might be enough. But really it’s only a down payment.” Slok added that “we need to flatten both the virus curve and the recession curve. So this would be a good start. But if the virus persists we may need far more stimulus.” Concern among those who say the current package is too small is driven mainly by fear that mass layoffs and business closings are already happening but have yet to show up in national economic data. That means if and when the virus crisis abates and Americans are able to go back to their regular lives, many will have no jobs and no income. And the rapid economic snap-back the White House is promising will be impossible to achieve. Most Americans work for the kind of small and mid-size employers that are most at risk of failing before they receive any federal assistance. “We don’t have time here. We need the business sector to be there when we need them again in June or July or heaven forbid September,” said Shepherdson. “So I’d like to see a package where businesses can just keep people on and pay them for two months even if they don’t do anything so they are still there when this is over.” White House officials continue to say that while the second quarter of this year will be bad, economic activity will quickly revive. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he thought the economy could emerge “stronger than ever before.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also promised a quick recovery in an appearance on Fox Business Network, forecasting a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent-up demand” and return to “a normal world.” But economists are increasingly worried the recovery could be much slower following mass layoffs and a wave of bankruptcies expected from small businesses like restaurants and bars that cannot survive the current lockdown of the American public. Wall Street is counting on Washington to quickly pass the next rescue package, warning that failure would cause massive sell-offs across financial markets. But some are also warning that Washington will have to come back and inject more money into the economy to avoid a long and deep recession. “How do you go to some people and say, ‘Sorry it’s a pandemic, tough luck,'” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “It’s almost like you have to bail out everyone. You can’t pick out winners and losers. Because this is nobody’s fault. That’s where that $1.2 trillion gets in trouble in my mind, because there is more damage than that out there.” The current figures being discussed, including proposals of around $1.2 trillion, are not without their defenders as at least a first step in trying to avoid a total economic collapse. “I do think the spread will be less bad because of what we’ve all done in the last week and the recovery a bit faster because of what is in process,” said Jason Furman, former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. “Over the last week I have not upgraded my assessment of the virus — I expected it to spread and be devastating. But I have upgraded my assessment of the government’s response. And that makes me feel just a little bit better about all of it.” But many analysts believe the current stimulus figure is based on an unrealistic assumption that normal life will resume in a matter of weeks when it actually may take months to flatten the virus curve and develop treatments and then even longer for a vaccine. “My rule of thumb with a stimulus package is you don’t match the economic damage. That’s not enough,” said Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “You need to do something on the order of twice that. So something like $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion could be the right number.” But more than the raw number, Caron said any stimulus package must immediately address the needs of small and midsize businesses that are seeing their revenues vanish — in some cases to zero. “Small and midsize businesses create 65 percent of employment. And consumption is 70 percent of the economy,” he said. “You’ve got to make sure those businesses are still there and people have jobs to go back to. And that means loans and other facilities that make money available to keep these businesses afloat. And that’s at least being discussed and that’s critical.” Defenders of the current plan note that the stimulus being considered by Congress is not the only firepower being deployed. The U.S. Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to essentially zero and opened up programs last deployed during the 2008 financial crisis to shore up financial markets and make loans more available to credit-worthy businesses. Still, some public policy groups say even with the Fed’s actions, Congress should err on the side of doing much more than it’s currently considering. “Given the sharp rise in unemployment we will likely see in coming weeks, there is an enormous risk that our fiscal policy response will be too small to cushion the blow to individuals and families or to significantly affect the downward trajectory of the economy,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report. “The risk of an inadequate response — resulting in significant hardship to families that can’t make ends meet and a considerably deeper and longer recession — vastly exceeds the risk of doing ‘too much.’”",‘It’s only a down payment’: Why a $1 trillion stimulus may not be enough ,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/why-coronavirus-stimulus-may-not-be-enough-138368,politico
"After being sidelined for much of the Trump administration, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams has suddenly emerged as a key player in its messaging about the coronavirus outbreak, often echoing the president’s arguments and winning his favor. Now a regular on Fox News and other programs, Adams routinely flanks President Donald Trump at news briefings and has amplified the White House’s line as it shifted from reassuring to more severe. “We’ve created a number of new stars, including the gentleman right behind me,” Trump said on March 14 at a White House news conference, turning to Adams. “I watched him the other day. It was such a fantastic job you did, and I really appreciate it.” Until this month, Health and Human Services leaders had worked to limit Adams’ portfolio, worried that the voluble doctor would go off-script and fail to coordinate his messaging, said four officials in the health department who spoke on condition of anonymity. Adams also had been one of several officials who had fallen out of favor with HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who instead leaned on Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health and Adams’ boss, to carry out some responsibilities that might have otherwise gone to the surgeon general. Meanwhile, the nation’s top doctor wasn’t added to the White House coronavirus task force until Vice President Mike Pence — Adams’ former boss as Indiana governor — took over the response from Azar three weeks ago. The high-profile, high-pressure job has placed a spotlight on an anesthesiologist who has long vowed that “health is apolitical and so am I.” But part of his success has come by paralleling Trump’s own questionable claims about coronavirus and break from other public health officials. Appearing on the March 2 edition of “Fox and Friends,” the surgeon general said he remained “convinced that more people are going to die by far from the flu than from coronavirus — not only in our country, but across the planet.” At the time, public health officials were urging Americans to stop comparing the new outbreak to the flu, noting that it minimized the risk of the far more deadly coronavirus, but Trump had used the comparison to allay concerns.  A spokesperson for Adams defended the comparison, telling POLITICO it “is not a case of either-or — both diseases can be deadly if we aren’t vigilant.” Adams on March 8 also said on CNN that he and other Trump officials “actually feel pretty good that some parts of the country have contained [coronavirus], just like when you look at the flu.” The interview came after Trump and other advisers on March 6 claimed the virus was contained — which it is not, as the president has since conceded. “That’s not under control for any place in the world,” Trump said on Monday.  In that same CNN interview, the 40-something Adams said that the 73-year-old Trump is “healthier than what I am” — a comment that drew snickers, given the roughly 30-year age gap. Adams’ allies said he was just responding to a question about the president’s relative risk for coronavirus and that the disease’s severity can be affected by pre-existing conditions, like Adams’ asthma. Adams last weekend delivered another controversial message: He scolded the media and appeared to encourage journalists to change their focus.  “No more bickering, no more partisanship, no more criticism or finger-pointing,” the surgeon general told reporters assembled at the White House. “There will be plenty of time for that.” A spokesperson for Adams said that he was attempting to encourage the media “to help share the facts and basic precautions” about the outbreak. Meanwhile, some of Adams’ warnings seem prescient, like a tweet last weekend urging hospitals to cancel all nonessential procedures to focus on coronavirus. While industry leaders privately called Adams alarmist and publicly wrote a letter of complaint, their thinking shifted amid the fast-moving outbreak, and on Wednesday, hospital groups agreed that they would scale back their services.  Adams also has used his platform to call for blood donations, enlist social media influencers, offer instructions on handwashing and hammer home the need for extensive social distancing — even beyond the 15-day time period previously announced by the White House. ""Fifteen days is likely not going to be enough to get us all the way through,” Adams said on Wednesday in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show. “But we really need to lean into it now so that we can bend the curve in the next 15 days, and at that point we'll reassess.” The White House praised Adams’ work on coronavirus. ""President Trump has built an incredible team that is helping coordinate our whole-of-government response and that includes the Surgeon General,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO, adding that Adams has also been leading on other priorities like fighting vaping, opioids and HIV. Spokespeople for Azar and Adams said the two men have a good working relationship.  “Secretary Azar agrees the surgeon general has an important role in communicating with the American people, educating them on appropriate measures to protect against viral infections, and calming fears,” an HHS spokesperson said. “Surgeon General Adams has been involved with the secretary’s briefings for weeks, and the secretary has always been supportive of the surgeon general’s advisories and initiatives.”  The surgeon general also has fans across the aisle. Adams is, indeed, “one of the stars of the Trump administration,” said Rebekah Gee, a Democrat who worked with Adams before she stepped down as Louisiana health secretary in January. Gee also praised Adams’ apolitical approach, including in the current coronavirus crisis. “He is doing a good job.” Adams first came to national prominence when then-Indiana Gov. Pence tapped him in 2014 to be the state’s health commissioner. The two men soon worked closely together to tackle Indiana’s 2014-2015 HIV outbreak, which was among the nation’s worst in years — and was compounded by Pence’s decision not to take swift action.  The issue was further complicated because the HIV outbreak was most severe among people who injected drugs, and Adams had to overcome opposition, including from Pence, to begin a needle-exchange program that has since been credited with helping contain the disease. “It's not always possible to get people to do what you think needs to be done by telling them what you think needs to be done,” said Joan Duwve, who served as Indiana’s chief medical officer and worked under Adams during the HIV outbreak. “I think that's probably where we were in the state of Indiana. … Jerome facilitated the necessary dialogue.” Adams ended up spending much of 2015 in the field, several former colleagues said, demonstrating skills that could be useful to navigate the current coronavirus outbreak. “Jerome took the time to understand everyone’s perspectives so he could then bring consensus around an issue — which was based on science and best practice,” Duwve added. Five years later, a similar needle-exchange program is now part of the Trump administration's goal to end the nation’s HIV epidemic by 2030 — despite long-standing conservative opposition. ""The fact that these evidence-based interventions are now part of a major national response to reduce HIV transmissions is probably a lesson learned from the Indiana outbreak,"" said Greg Millett of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. Adams joined the Trump administration in 2017, where he’s tried to straddle politically sensitive issues like gun violence — an issue that bogged down his predecessor, Vivek Murthy — and kept a relatively low national profile. Adams also had little interaction with the president until the current outbreak. But his high-profile remarks during Trump’s coronavirus response have raised eyebrows from media critics like Brian Stelter. The CNN host on Sunday devoted a segment to rebutting Adams’ call that reporters hold off on “criticism” during the coronavirus outbreak. “I need him to do his job, focus on keeping the country as healthy as possible, and do not lecture the media on how to handle this,” Stelter said during the show. A former staffer said that Adams’ remarks were likely misconstrued. “I think that was his frustration as a public health official coming out,” said Joey Fox, an Indiana consultant who worked closely with Adams in that state’s health department. “I’m sure he wants the news 24-7 to be blaring, ‘stay the hell home.’” But Adams’ remarks were amplified by pro-Trump media, including Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro. “I was cheering you on,” Pirro told Adams last weekend. “I think that the finger-pointing that's been going on against this administration — when we are dealing with something new, something we've never dealt with before, something we're not actually built to deal with — you came out and said, ‘Enough. Let's just do it.’""",Trump’s new public health 'star',2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/surgeon-general-jerome-adams-coronavirus-138397,politico

"The Department of Veterans Affairs is preparing to deploy 3,000 doctors, nurses and other emergency personnel — along with mobile hospitals and pharmacies — to bolster the nationwide effort to combat the coronavirus, Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie told POLITICO on Thursday. The VA, which runs 170 veterans hospitals and 135 community living centers around the country, is designated as the backup health system to the military in the event of war. But it is also authorized to assist in natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or in this case, a pandemic. The VA is ""preparing for a national call on this matter,"" Wilkie said in a telephone interview, likening the personnel to military reservists who can be called up by the president at any time. ""They know that they can be deployed anywhere in the country. Just like the reserves, their physicals are up to date, their shots are up to date. That prepares them to launch when called upon."" Asked if he has any timeline on when they might be needed, Wilkie said, ""we haven't come to that point yet."" But he said the agency is gaming out where they might be most needed. For example, ""city X has this happen, what is the request from the governor, and how do you respond to that governor's request that comes through,"" Wilkie said. One of the main purposes of the National Disaster Medical System, as it is known, is ""to assist state and local authorities in responding to medical and public health effects of major disasters and emergencies,"" according to the VA. This crisis poses numerous challenges, including the fact that some of the VA's emergency medical personnel are likely already treating patients with the virus — and the number of cases in veterans hospitals are expected to grow. That is a double-edged sword because it means some already have experience with the outbreak but they also might be needed where they are. ""They've been responding to natural disasters, so that's their forte,"" Wilkie said. ""But they're also working in hospitals now where they're dealing with this virus."" The emergency cadre includes ""doctors, nurses, psychologists, engineers, nutritionists, police,"" Wilkie said. ""In addition to that, we are able to provide a mobile hospital. We're able to provide command posts. We're able to provide nutrition centers, medical vans, mobile pharmacies to support those needs."" Beyond providing additional medical personnel, if necessary the VA health system could also make available extra hospital capacity. ""If the president so chooses,"" Wilkie said, ""we would augment civilian capabilities when it comes to medical space available."" In the meantime, the VA is trying to minimize the spread of the virus in its own medical facilities, including barring family visits, reducing routine appointments, and delaying dental and elective surgeries. The steps are all designed to cut down on social interaction but also free up resources for what is expected to be an increase of the virus among veterans. ""We were the first system in the country to start triaging people before they even entered,"" Wilkie said. Barring visitors for elderly veterans ""is a terrible thing because the majority of those 7,800 who are in those living centers come from World War II and Korea. And we had to make the painful choice in order to protect them,"" Wilkie said. So far, Wilkie reports that 85 veterans ""we know of"" have the virus. Of those, 50 are recuperating at home. ""They didn't need to be admitted to our hospitals,"" he said. But he said ""we expect a lot more"" veterans suffering from the coronavirus. ""We'll see a jump in the next few days, as the rest of the country.""","VA secretary: VA preparing to deploy 3,000 medical personnel for virus response",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/veterans-affairs-coronavirus-138513,politico

"A majority of Americans now approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, as the administration has issued stricter federal guidelines in recent days and the president has adopted a more public-facing role in combating the disease. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday reports that 55 percent of respondents approve of Trump's management of the public health crisis, while 43 percent disapprove. The latest figures represent a boost in the president's rating from the previous iteration of the survey, published one week ago, which showed only 43 percent approval for Trump and 54 percent disapproval. The uptick in public sentiment comes in the wake of a variety of measures the president has taken since last Friday to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States. Trump has been widely criticized for his initial response to the pandemic as well as his adminitration's inability to quickly ramp up testing in the U.S. Trump has declared a national emergency, expanded the European travel ban, urged people to avoid group gatherings of more than 10 people, signaled his support for dispensing checks to affected Americans, and invoked the Defense Production Act — although he has stopped short of actually triggering the statute. The president has also often led the daily press briefings of the White House coronavirus task force, announcing new federal actions, taking questions from reporters and generally appearing more solemn regarding the nature of the threat facing the country.  Governors on the front lines of the outbreak have praised the administration's increased engagement, while still demanding a more robust, all-encompassing federal response and the delivery of sorely needed medical equipment in anticipation of the coronavirus' overrunning of local health care systems.  But Trump has largely placed the onus back on governors to acquire those potentially life-saving supplies, telling reporters Thursday that the federal government is ""not a shipping clerk.""",Poll: Majority of Americans now approve of Trump's coronavirus management,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/poll-majority-of-americans-now-approve-of-trumps-coronavirus-management-138570,politico

"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Friday that ""more needs to be done"" to make coronavirus testing widely available across the U.S. even as the Trump administration ramps up its efforts to check Americans for exposure to the illness. ""Clearly, more needs to be done, but we are rapidly getting to the point where we will have many, many tests out there available for virtually everyone,"" Fauci said in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show. The remarks from the nation's top infectious disease expert represent an improvement in his assessment of the administration's testing system, which he characterized during congressional testimony last week as a ""failing."" While President Donald Trump's initial management of the pandemic has been widely condemned by state leaders and public health experts, the most criticized aspect of the administration's early response was its inability to quickly mount a large-scale testing operation and track tests that had migrated to local health care providers. But Trump and members of the White House coronavirus task force over the past week have touted increased levels of cooperation with the private sector that they say will make screening more accessible, while cautioning that the new wave of tests will result in an explosion of new cases. ""Early on, as I've said, it wasn't the way it should've been. But we're really now very much in the right direction, flooding the system with it,"" Fauci said Friday. ""There are going to be people, for sure, who will call in and say they can't get tested. It's not a perfect system yet, but we're getting there very rapidly."" The president has largely attributed the testing deficiencies to his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arguing that the federal agency was unprepared to tackle an outbreak of this magnitude. He has also claimed without evidence that former President Barack Obama's administration shares blame for the shortfall, remarking last week that ""I don't take responsibility at all.""","Fauci: 'Clearly, more needs to be done' on coronavirus testing",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/fauci-clearly-more-needs-to-be-done-on-coronavirus-testing-138636,politico
"The Sustainability Spotlight is an extension of the Global Translations newsletter. Each week we track major issues facing the globe. Sign up here. The coronavirus pandemic is about to show us the truth behind the ESG — Environment, Social and Governance — commitment of many companies.  Despite facing massive economic turbulence, airlines cleared the way for the world’s civil aviation authority (ICAO) to adopt its carbon offset scheme, known as CORSIA, as planned last weekend. But Alexis Crow, head of PwC’s geopolitical investing practice, warns that for some companies, “their power to deliver” on climate change commitments “may be eroded” by coronavirus. To retain overall ESG credibility, Crow said it’s crucial for companies to consider how the social aspect of ESG is implemented if they are putting their environmental work on hold.  The U.S. private sector has so far led the way globally — for better and worse. American companies are helping more staff work from home than anywhere else, but they're also firing workers and refusing them sick leave in massive numbers. Some of the world’s richest companies (including Amazon) don’t offer sick leave to some staff, while billionaires who burnish their progressive image are asking staff to go on unpaid leave (Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic).  Companies and governments struggling to ensure an effective social contribution can turn to organizations like the Social Progress Index (SPI), a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit that sucks in data from all over the world to present open source quality of life indicators. Organizations from the European Commission to the Indian prime minister’s think-tank and local authorities around Silicon Valley are using SPI’s data to redirect their resources. While SPI focuses purely on social data, CEO Michael Green says there are economic lessons to draw from the data. “Long-term economic success is built on strong social foundations,” he said, adding that “we can also point to a lot of supply chain risk” through social data.  With coronavirus now slamming into the American economy, and potentially trillions in bailout support about to become available, SPI has good timing with its next target: getting U.S. states and local authorities to see and address widely diverging levels of social progress. SPI gives Massachusetts scores of 64 in its index, and Mississippi just 27. HOW GREEN IS YOUR BAILOUT? By the end of next week, we will likely have more than $3 trillion in financial commitments on the table from governments around the world aimed at stabilizing the global economy.  While South Korea’s ruling party this week upped its existing plans for a Korean Green Deal in its platform ahead of an April 15 election, and a group of Democratic senators in the United States wants to place green conditions on airline bailouts, few have rushed to make green projects a feature of emerging stimulus and bailout plans. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has made green noises in the stimulus debate — ”we must keep our promises for people and planet” — but has no power.  Green skeptics on both sides of the Atlantic have wasted no time pushing for delays or cuts to climate initiatives. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš wants Europe to “forget about the Green Deal'' and Poland requested the bloc’s carbon trading scheme be paused. Some U.S. oil refiners are preparing to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone a government-mandated shift requiring retail fuel stations to sell only cleaner-burning gasoline to minimize air pollution in the warmer months, starting on June 1.  Wherever the economic stimulus money goes, it will dwarf the resources that have been on offer to stabilize the planet. Even at the height of global generosity, Ed King of the Global Strategic Communications Council (GSCC), a climate network, points out that rich nations pledged $100 billion a year in climate finance to poorer nations. They never delivered the cash. “After years of saying there was no cash, it turns out there is lots,” King said in an emailed statement. CORONAVIRUS MEETS CLIMATE CHANGE MAILBOX Zack Colman asked two frontline players — Bill McKibben, activist and co-founder of 350.org, and Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) — what the pandemic tells us about the climate challenge.  “It means that we should always remember the physical world is, in a word, real — you can't spin or negotiate or compromise with the physics of climate change any more than you can with the biology of Covid-19 ... If we'd started 30 years ago we could have easily 'flattened the curve' of temperature rise. If you want to bail out oil companies, banks, and airlines, make damned sure that they're forced to commit to meeting the Paris targets. It means listen to scientists.” — Bill McKibben “It means that the need to get our citizenry focused on the urgency and seriousness of the climate issue takes a backseat to the pandemic. The global pandemic demonstrates in very understandable terms that a problem on one continent will find its way to other continents, with serious economic and public health consequences.” — Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) BIODIVERSITY IS DOWN WHILE DISEASE OUTBREAKS ARE UP: Hundreds of disease outbreaks occur each year. While the intense connections generated by globalization explain some of that disease spread, so do environmental shifts: namely loss of biodiversity and climate change. Deforestation has been linked to three out of every ten recent disease outbreaks.

"BEIJING — China has exonerated a doctor who was officially reprimanded for warning about the coronavirus outbreak and later died of the disease, a startling admission of error by the ruling Communist Party that generally bodes no challenges to its authority. The party’s top disciplinary body said the police force in Wuhan had revoked its admonishment of Dr. Li Wenliang that had included a threat of arrest. It also said a “solemn apology” had been issued to Li’s family and that two police officers, identified only by their surnames, had been issued “disciplinary punishments” for the original handling of the matter. In death, Li became the face of simmering anger at the ruling Communist Party’s controls over information and complaints that officials lie about or hide disease outbreaks, industrial accidents, natural disasters and financial frauds, while punishing whistleblowers and independent journalists. After seeing thousands of new cases daily at the peak of the city’s outbreak a month ago, Wuhan on Friday had its second consecutive day with no new confirmed or suspected cases. The National Health Commission said all of the 39 new cases recorded Friday in China were brought from overseas, showing that rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect. China has loosened some travel restrictions in Hubei, the province surrounding Wuhan, although its provincial border remains closed and Wuhan itself remains under lockdown. Officials say they will only lift the quarantine after Wuhan goes 14 consecutive days with no new cases. Police in December had reprimanded eight doctors including Li for warning friends on social media about the emerging threat. China’s supreme court later criticized the police, but the ruling party continued to tighten its grip on information about the outbreak. The party has faced similar accusations of bungling or thuggish behavior following previous disasters. They include the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a 2005 chemical spill that disrupted water supplies to millions of people in China’s northeast, sales of tainted milk that sickened thousands of children and the failure of private finance companies after the global economic crisis. In each case, officials were accused of trying to conceal or delay information people said they needed to protect themselves. The party often responds by allowing the public to vent temporarily, then uses its control of media and the internet to stifle criticism. Critics who persist can be jailed on vague charges of spreading rumors or making trouble. The treatment of Li’s case may reflect concerns among the leadership about public anger over the failure to properly honor the sacrifices of front-line health workers while praising the party and its head, Xi Jinping, who has tightened controls on society since taking power in 2012. The most powerful Chinese leader since at least the 1980s, Xi gave himself the option of remaining president for life by changing the Chinese constitution in 2018 to remove a two-term limit. In Wuhan, local leaders were accused of telling doctors in December not to publicize the spreading virus in order to avoid casting a shadow over the annual meeting of a local legislative body. As the virus spread, doctors were ordered to delete posts on social media that appealed for donations of medical supplies. That prompted complaints authorities were more worried about image than public safety. Li was detained by police after warning about the virus on a social media group for his former classmates.",China exonerates doctor reprimanded for warning of virus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/china-exonerates-doctor-reprimanded-for-warning-of-virus-138637,politico

"Washington is poised to blast more than $1 trillion into the U.S. economy to help offset the devastating effects of the coronavirus, which has locked down much of the nation and rocked businesses large and small. It might not be nearly enough. As forecasts darken with estimates for huge spikes in unemployment and sharp drops in economic growth, economists and Wall Street analysts are warning that even the huge stimulus package now under consideration on Capitol Hill may only make a small dent. Some suggest the number needs to be at least $2 trillion or perhaps far more. “They should be doing much more than they are thinking about and doing it much quicker, at least $2 trillion with the promise of more to come,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We have whole industries like the restaurant industry that have been obliterated already. Jobless claims next week could be two or three million.” Shepherdson added that “we could see a drop of 5 million jobs in April. We are going to see numbers we never thought possible. This will be the biggest economic hit that any developed economy has ever seen outside wartime.” Calls for much bigger stimulus are coming from across the partisan spectrum. Former Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Narayana Kocherlakota has suggested a package of at least $2.5 trillion. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed at least $2 trillion. Former White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci, who has broken with the administration, suggested the current package was far too small. He’s calling for more than $3 trillion. “This is literally like a combo of 9/11, the global financial crisis and an invasion of every nation’s homeland,” he said Thursday on CNN. “$1 trillion is six weeks’ worth of firepower. We need six months’ worth of firepower.” The reason so many want to see bigger numbers is mostly just simple math. “$1.2 trillion in pure terms is going to cover about two to three weeks of economic activity,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. “So if this were going to last just that long, $1 trillion might be enough. But really it’s only a down payment.” Slok added that “we need to flatten both the virus curve and the recession curve. So this would be a good start. But if the virus persists we may need far more stimulus.” Concern among those who say the current package is too small is driven mainly by fear that mass layoffs and business closings are already happening but have yet to show up in national economic data. That means if and when the virus crisis abates and Americans are able to go back to their regular lives, many will have no jobs and no income. And the rapid economic snap-back the White House is promising will be impossible to achieve. Most Americans work for the kind of small and mid-size employers that are most at risk of failing before they receive any federal assistance. “We don’t have time here. We need the business sector to be there when we need them again in June or July or heaven forbid September,” said Shepherdson. “So I’d like to see a package where businesses can just keep people on and pay them for two months even if they don’t do anything so they are still there when this is over.” White House officials continue to say that while the second quarter of this year will be bad, economic activity will quickly revive. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he thought the economy could emerge “stronger than ever before.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also promised a quick recovery in an appearance on Fox Business Network, forecasting a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent-up demand” and return to “a normal world.” But economists are increasingly worried the recovery could be much slower following mass layoffs and a wave of bankruptcies expected from small businesses like restaurants and bars that cannot survive the current lockdown of the American public. Wall Street is counting on Washington to quickly pass the next rescue package, warning that failure would cause massive sell-offs across financial markets. But some are also warning that Washington will have to come back and inject more money into the economy to avoid a long and deep recession. “How do you go to some people and say, ‘Sorry it’s a pandemic, tough luck,'” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “It’s almost like you have to bail out everyone. You can’t pick out winners and losers. Because this is nobody’s fault. That’s where that $1.2 trillion gets in trouble in my mind, because there is more damage than that out there.” The current figures being discussed, including proposals of around $1.2 trillion, are not without their defenders as at least a first step in trying to avoid a total economic collapse. “I do think the spread will be less bad because of what we’ve all done in the last week and the recovery a bit faster because of what is in process,” said Jason Furman, former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. “Over the last week I have not upgraded my assessment of the virus — I expected it to spread and be devastating. But I have upgraded my assessment of the government’s response. And that makes me feel just a little bit better about all of it.” But many analysts believe the current stimulus figure is based on an unrealistic assumption that normal life will resume in a matter of weeks when it actually may take months to flatten the virus curve and develop treatments and then even longer for a vaccine. “My rule of thumb with a stimulus package is you don’t match the economic damage. That’s not enough,” said Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “You need to do something on the order of twice that. So something like $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion could be the right number.” But more than the raw number, Caron said any stimulus package must immediately address the needs of small and midsize businesses that are seeing their revenues vanish — in some cases to zero. “Small and midsize businesses create 65 percent of employment. And consumption is 70 percent of the economy,” he said. “You’ve got to make sure those businesses are still there and people have jobs to go back to. And that means loans and other facilities that make money available to keep these businesses afloat. And that’s at least being discussed and that’s critical.” Defenders of the current plan note that the stimulus being considered by Congress is not the only firepower being deployed. The U.S. Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to essentially zero and opened up programs last deployed during the 2008 financial crisis to shore up financial markets and make loans more available to credit-worthy businesses. Still, some public policy groups say even with the Fed’s actions, Congress should err on the side of doing much more than it’s currently considering. “Given the sharp rise in unemployment we will likely see in coming weeks, there is an enormous risk that our fiscal policy response will be too small to cushion the blow to individuals and families or to significantly affect the downward trajectory of the economy,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report. “The risk of an inadequate response — resulting in significant hardship to families that can’t make ends meet and a considerably deeper and longer recession — vastly exceeds the risk of doing ‘too much.’”",The government’s multitrillion-dollar problem,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/why-coronavirus-stimulus-may-not-be-enough-138368,politico
"The Pentagon and the White House, in the weeks leading up to the president’s national emergency declaration on Friday, quarreled over the response to the coronavirus outbreak that was sweeping the country. Defense Department leaders urged measures such as restricting troop travel in order to contain the virus. But other administration officials pushed back, arguing against any “rash” steps that could have political ramifications and economic impact, defense officials told POLITICO. It wasn't until President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 that leaders began to coalesce around a strategy. Trump’s comments served as a “green light” for DoD leaders to take more aggressive steps such as providing medical equipment, putting field hospitals on alert and making preparations to dispatch the military’s twin hospital ships to virus hotspots, said the defense official. “We’re muddling through,” one defense official said.  This story is based on interviews with half a dozen current and former defense and administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the last few weeks of sensitive discussions. From the start of the crisis, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has given his deputies — the service chiefs, combatant commanders and civilian leaders — flexibility to issue guidance to a mammoth force of almost 3 million people, including 1.3 million active-duty military and their families. And in recent days, senior Pentagon officials advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former administration official.  Esper obliged, making appearances on Fox News, CNN and in the White House briefing room to lay out a number of steps the department is taking to support the coronavirus response. “I want to assure all of your viewers that the United States military remains ready and capable of defending the American people, protecting the nation and safeguarding our interests abroad,” Esper said on Fox News on Tuesday. But absent clear direction from the White House, the Pentagon’s initial internal response to the crisis, was ad hoc. In recent days, officials have scrambled to prepare the Navy's hospital ships, USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy, to help relieve pressure on civilian hospitals, defense officials said. Despite Trump’s assertion that the ships are “in tip-top shape,” the Comfort, homeported in Norfolk, Va., has been in pierside maintenance since December after returning from a five-month deployment and will not get underway until April 2. Meanwhile the Mercy, based out of San Diego, will be able to launch to its West Coast destination, either in California or Washington State, on Monday. Defense Department spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman pushed back on the notion that the Pentagon’s initial response wasn't carefully planned. ""The Department has been planning and executing against the Coronavirus since the first cases were reported in January,” Hoffman said. “What is inaccurately characterized as an 'ad hoc' approach is instead a deliberate effort to balance mitigation and prevention with the need to defend our nation.""  The White House did not respond to requests for comment. In its efforts to get the Comfort underway as soon as possible, the Navy’s Military Sealift Command, which is responsible for the hospital ships, has been forced to defer ""a small amount"" of scheduled work on the vessels until a later date, a Navy spokesperson said. Guidance on domestic and international travel for troops also trickled out in a disjointed fashion over the past few weeks. U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East and Afghanistan, canceled all leave and liberty travel for U.S. troops serving in the region on Feb. 27. On the same day, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command postponed a major exercise with South Korea, and the Navy ordered all ships that have visited countries in the Pacific region to remain at sea for 14 days in order to monitor sailors for any symptoms.  But DoD-wide travel restrictions did not go into effect until March 11, when Esper banned movement of DoD civilians and families traveling to, from or through “Level 3” locations — such as South Korea, Iran and Italy — for 60 days. In some ways the Department of Defense has been ahead of the curve on the coronavirus crisis. Even before the first cases were reported in South Korea on Feb. 2, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea began enforcing strict measures in January, including testing, self-isolation and social distancing. The Defense Department has also been conducting regular, sometimes twice-daily, press briefings on the crisis in recent days, sending senior officials such as Esper, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel and others to the podium to talk about the department’s response. This is a sharp contrast to the State Department, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been criticized for a lack of transparency. But until this week, department leaders were not always on the same page. While Esper believes commanders and service leaders are in the best position to make major decisions for their forces, he has given explicit instructions to those officials that any major decision needs to be communicated up the chain of command, officials say.  After being blindsided on multiple occasions over the past few weeks, Esper has had to intervene at lower levels to ensure the department presents a unified front, three current and former defense officials tell POLITICO. “It comes back to: we shouldn’t learn about these through media channels or them becoming public,” said one defense official.“But the last thing we want to do is hamstring those commanders.” After the Army on March 8 preempted DoD in ordering a halt to the movement of troops and their families into and out of Italy and South Korea, Esper was forced to step in, two defense officials said. The secretary stressed to Army leadership the need to keep him and the Joint Chiefs informed of any new guidance, according to the officials. The Pentagon on Monday banned all domestic and international travel through at least May 11. Esper intervened once more over the weekend after the Army considered freezing basic training for new recruits amid concern about virus spread, according to three defense officials. The Washington Post first reported the Army's move. Esper met with the leaders of the armed services on Monday to discuss the issue, ultimately deciding to continue basic training while taking precautionary measures, one of the defense officials said. Hoffman noted the complexity of the issue, saying “the Coronavirus situations in the more than 150 countries DoD has forces around the world are different, have progressed at different paces and require different solutions."" ""That is exactly why Secretary Esper has delegated the authority to issue enhanced force protection guidance to local commanders,"" he said. Since Monday, Esper and the rest of the department have spent a good bit of time in front of cameras. Speaking alongside Trump on Wednesday, Esper said that in addition to preparing the hospital ships, which are equipped with 1,000 beds each, he has alerted field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as needed to support the response. These capabilities are designed for trauma and other combat injuries, Esper stressed, and will be used to relieve pressure on civilian hospitals treating coronavirus victims.  Separately, the Pentagon has opened its 16 certified coronavirus testing labs to test non-DoD personnel; will make available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves; and will distribute up to 2,000 deployable ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services, Esper said. “We have plans in place. We've been implementing them now for several weeks. And we're also wanting to lean forward and support again, the whole government approach to assist the American people,” Esper said on Fox.",Trump’s wobbly coronavirus response leaves Pentagon playing catch-up,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-pentagon-coronavirus-defense-138095,politico

"The State Department is beginning to put together charter flights for Americans stranded overseas during the coronavirus pandemic, with Morocco and Peru scheduled soon — even as others stuck in Guatemala took matters into their own hands. The rush to bring Americans home comes after the State Department announced a level four travel advisory Thursday, and amid reports of potentially thousands of Americans stuck in multiple countries without commercial flights or that had shut their borders. The first flights out of Morocco, which closed its borders on March 14, started Friday morning, according to the U.S. embassy there. U.S. citizens are able to hop a flight from Marrakesh for $1,485. The flights will stop in London before landing in 10 different U.S. cities. Stranded Americans — citizens and legal permanent residents only — must sign up by emailing [email protected] Congressional offices were alerted of the flights Thursday night, according to one aide who received details via a State Department email. Congressional staff also received an email saying that Avianca Airlines, a Colombian air carrier, has created an online page where the hundreds of Americans stranded in Peru can sign up for flights home. Others, tired of waiting for the U.S. government to act, took matters into their own hands, in some cases crossing over the border from Guatemala into Mexico to catch flights that are still operating. Two people stuck in Guatemala, which has also closed its borders to flights, told POLITICO that they had purchased tickets from Avianca this week which were canceled, and that the airline had ignored their calls afterward. Avianca did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump also said Thursday that the U.S. military is working on getting people out of Peru, but didn't mention any other countries specifically.

"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Friday that “more needs to be done” to make coronavirus testing widely available across the United States, even as the Trump administration ramps up its efforts to check Americans for exposure to the illness. “Clearly, more needs to be done, but we are rapidly getting to the point where we will have many, many tests out there available for virtually everyone,” Fauci said in an interview on NBC's “Today” show. The remarks from the nation’s top infectious disease expert represent an improvement in his assessment of the administration’s testing system, which he characterized during congressional testimony last week as a “failing.” While President Donald Trump’s initial management of the pandemic has been widely condemned by state leaders and public health experts, the most criticized aspect of the administration’s early response was its inability to quickly mount a large-scale testing operation and track tests that had migrated to local health care providers. But Trump and members of the White House coronavirus task force over the past week have touted increased levels of cooperation with the private sector that they say will make screening more accessible, while cautioning that the new wave of tests will result in an explosion of cases. “Early on, as I’ve said, it wasn’t the way it should’ve been. But we’re really now very much in the right direction, flooding the system with it,” Fauci said Friday. “There are going to be people, for sure, who will call in and say they can’t get tested. It’s not a perfect system yet, but we’re getting there very rapidly.” The president has largely attributed the testing deficiencies to his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arguing that the federal agency was unprepared to tackle an outbreak of this magnitude. He has also claimed without evidence that former President Barack Obama’s administration shares blame for the shortfall, remarking last week that “I don’t take responsibility at all.”","Fauci: ‘Clearly, more needs to be done’ on coronavirus testing",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/fauci-clearly-more-needs-to-be-done-on-coronavirus-testing-138636,politico
"A majority of Americans now approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, as the administration has issued stricter federal guidelines in recent days and the president has adopted a more public-facing role in combating the disease. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday reports that 55 percent of respondents approve of Trump’s management of the public health crisis, while 43 percent disapprove. The latest figures represent a boost in the president’s rating from the previous iteration of the survey, published one week ago, which showed only 43 percent approval for Trump and 54 percent disapproval. The uptick in public sentiment comes in the wake of a variety of measures the president has taken to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States. Trump has been widely criticized for his initial response to the pandemic, as well as his adminitration’s inability to quickly ramp up testing across the country. Since last Friday, Trump has declared a national emergency, expanded the European travel ban, urged against group gatherings of more than 10 people, signaled his support for dispensing checks to affected Americans, and invoked the Defense Production Act — although he has stopped short of actually triggering the statute. The president has also often led the daily press briefings of the White House coronavirus task force, announcing new federal actions, taking questions from reporters and generally appearing more solemn regarding the nature of the threat facing the U.S.  Governors on the front lines of the outbreak have praised the administration’s increased engagement, while still demanding a more robust, all-encompassing federal response and the delivery of sorely needed medical equipment in anticipation of the coronavirus’ overrunning of local health care systems.  But Trump has largely placed the onus back on governors to acquire those potentially life-saving supplies, telling reporters Thursday that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk.”  He has also denied responsibility for the administration’s testing failures in the early stages of the outbreak, instead blaming without evidence former President Barack Obama and attributing the shortfall to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey published Tuesday showed that more Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling the coronavirus than those who approve, 49 percent to 44 percent, and few trust in the information they hear from the president about COVID-19. The ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted March 18-19, surveying 512 adults. Its margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5 percentage points.",Poll: Majority of Americans now approve of Trump’s coronavirus management,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/poll-majority-of-americans-now-approve-of-trumps-coronavirus-management-138570,politico
"The scarcity of surgical face masks and other protective equipment for health workers has quickly become the most urgent problem facing those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. Manufacturers are ramping up production of masks, gowns and gloves, but there will be a lag before the new supplies can reach hospitals already struggling to care for infected patients. Earlier this week, Vice President Mike Pence called on construction companies to donate their dust masks – which are identical to the ones used by doctors and nurses -- to their local hospitals. But there’s another source of protective medical equipment that hasn’t yet been discussed: Dentists and veterinarians. With the right financial incentives, dentists and vets can help bridge this critical gap. Dentists and veterinarians use the exact same personal protective equipment as other medical workers, and they adhere to rigorous OSHA guidelines for surgical masks, gloves, and various sanitization materials. With an estimated 200,419 dentists and 71,060 veterinarians in the U.S. workforce primarily in private practice, there exists an inventory of readily available medical equipment in dental and veterinary offices that could reinforce the strained supply chain. But here’s the problem: Most dental and veterinary offices are small businesses. Despite recommendations from the American Dental Association, many dental offices are staying open during the crisis; they share the concerns of fellow small business owners in staying financially solvent and keeping employees on the payroll. Many are holding off as they await details of the small business loans included in the Senate’s COVID relief legislation, to see if they can afford to close. Meanwhile, their valuable medical supplies—such as face masks—have not been redirected towards hospitals.  Rather than hope for good will, federal and state governments should quickly implement policies to incentivize dentists and veterinarians to contribute their medical supplies to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Here are two ideas for doing that:  A direct buy-back program. Federal, state and local governments could offer to purchase personal protective equipment from dental and veterinary clinics and directly cut a check to the businesses. This would provide dentists and vets quick revenue at a time that they may be strapped for cash; this would allow them to close while redistributing their inventory to hospitals. While the ideal buy-back program would be at market rate or cost-plus pricing, the costs of such a plan may be less politically palatable given the already high level of estimated federal spending on COVID relief and economic stimulus. An alternative would be for governments to offer to purchase the protective equipment at a percentage of Medicare rates instead. (A similar policy could also be implemented for individual hoarders of protective equipment, but at a lower rate to discourage their practice.) A “war bonds” style bond exchange. Historically, war bonds were federally-backed patriotic debt securities purchased by citizens to finance the war efforts of World Wars I and II. Citizens purchased bonds to generate federal monetary supply in exchange for a guaranteed return on their security with interest at a lower rate. In echoing a war time call to combat disease, modeling a similar initiative for protective equipment could incentivize donations faster and at lower cost to the government than a direct buyback. Here’s how a bond program could work: the government could set the value of a “COVID bond” at a discounted Medicare rate for the protective equipment and guarantee a set rate of interest. For example, if you donated $100 worth of masks, the government would issue you a bond currently valued at $80 with a guaranteed rate of 2.5% interest a year. At the end of a 15-year term, the bond would be valued at $115.86. Dentists and vets could either hold onto the bonds or, if they needed short-term capital, sell the bonds on a secondary market to other individuals for cash. These options would benefit both sides: Hospitals would receive a short-term influx of protective equipment , while private dental and veterinary offices could utilize the funds to cover fixed costs and offer employees leave. This way, dentists and vets could immediately contribute to addressing the public health emergency at a time when they are already seeing fewer patients already and benefit when demand and productivity resumes.  With hospital supplies nearing critical levels, the federal government must use creative policy tools to bolster dwindling supplies of protective equipment. Tapping existing inventory of masks, gowns and gloves in dental and veterinary offices can bridge the gap in the availability of personal protective equipment as we wait for supply chains to ramp up.

"The U.S. and Mexico on Friday agreed to temporarily close the border to nonessential travel in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. U.S. and Mexican officials have been in talks this week over how to ensure that trade and essential travel is not disrupted at the border. It’s a similar move to the U.S. and Canada’s decision on Wednesday to impose travel restrictions at the northern U.S. border. “Both countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus and ensure the commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing,” Pompeo said in a White House press conference. “The United States is glad to have a friend that is working side-by-side with us in the fight.""  The U.S.' agreement with Mexico and Canada to restrict non-essential travel will go into effect on Saturday. Pompeo and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard finalized details on the travel restrictions on Thursday night after frequent talks this week, sources familiar with the talks said. Ebrard, for his part, wrote on Twitter on Thursday night that he has pressed to ensure that measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus “don’t paralyze economic activity and that the border continues to be open to commerce and work.” Still, the coronavirus outbreak — and travel restrictions — could disrupt the $1.7 billion in U.S.-Mexico trade that takes place every day. “We’ve already seen it get more expensive for truckers to take loads of goods from the border up north,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) told POLITICO. Cuellar explained that a lot of truck drivers typically fly into Laredo and pick up loads of goods from Mexico at the border to distribute to retailers across the country. Laredo is already seeing a significantly smaller number of truck drivers flying in, he said. But the Texas Democrat said he’s received assurances from the Trump administration that they are trying not to disrupt trade with any new travel restrictions. Trucks and trains will continue to cross the border to deliver goods between the two countries, he said. Cuellar said he’s been in touch with acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan to ensure the administration understands what constitutes essential travel at the border, given that there’s many Mexicans that “live in Nuevo Laredo and they come work here [in the U.S.] or people that come to buy medicine here that’s essential.” “It’s been a top priority to ensure that while, yes, we help stop transmission of the virus, we still keep balance of trade — especially given that we trade with Mexico a million dollars a minute,” Cuellar said. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said Friday that North American trade would not be affected by the U.S.' agreement with Canada and Mexico to partially close the border. ""Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce. Essential commerce activities will not be impacted. We will continue to maintain a strong and secure economic supply chain across our borders,"" Wolf said.  Meanwhile, Mexican officials have been working overtime to ensure that business goes on as usual between the two countries given that they are top trading partners. Mexican Undersecretary for North America Jesus Seade said he spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday to ensure any border measures don’t affect trade. Trump was also quick to emphasize on Friday that his administration is treating both Mexico and Canada the same in working together to combat the coronavirus. ""We are treating the borders equally, the northern border and the southern border. They're being treated equally. A lot of people say they are not being treated equally. They are,"" Trump said. Earlier this week, Trump said his administration plans to remove migrants and asylum seekers that cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally — a move that would be separate from the nonessential travel ban. He said he would invoke a law that allows the U.S. surgeon general to turn away people or goods to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.","U.S., Mexico to partially close border ",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/us-mexico-ready-to-partially-close-border-138946,politico
"Top Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators — joined by senior Trump administration officials — kicked off talks Friday on a massive, third stimulus package to salvage the economy, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to ravage the country. The negotiators are meeting this morning in the historic Hart 216 room, where Supreme Court nominations and crucial hearings often are held. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said they aim to have an agreement in principle by the end of Friday.  “I tasked these bipartisan teams to reach agreement by the end of the day today, tonight,” McConnell said. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we’ve agreed to … We’ll need tomorrow for Legislative Counsel to draft the agreement. And as [Mnuchin] has indicated, it is important for us to be on the Senate floor and pass the measure by Monday.” The talks come a day after Senate Republicans introduced their $1 trillion stimulus package to save the U.S. economy by assisting individuals, small businesses and industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.  But Senate Democrats have already raised concerns with the GOP proposal, saying it benefits businesses and industries while not doing enough for working people.  “We need to work together quickly and do something big and bold that helps the American people,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), before the start of the meeting. “Sen. McConnell’s bill is not pro worker at all, it puts corporations ahead of people.” Schumer, who spoke to President Donald Trump Friday morning, asked the president to use the Defense Production Act for more medical equipment, including ventilators, according to Schumer’s spokesperson.  After speaking with Schumer, Trump said he had an “extremely good” conversation with the minority leader and expressed optimism about the “Phase 3” stimulus deal.  ""We were working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will,” Trump said at a daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. He didn’t address the Defense Production Act. He added that he also spoke at length with McConnell.  Among the key provisions of the GOP package is a plan to provide direct cash payments to individuals of up to $1,200 and families of up to $2,400, based on income. In addition to direct cash payments, the GOP stimulus plan gives small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans and $200 billion for loans for industries, including airlines.  The structure of the payments are a potential issue even for some Republican members. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has panned the idea of direct cash payments broadly, while Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are calling for the package to be fixed, after expressing concern that its structure doesn’t sufficiently benefit lower income Americans.  “Americans urgently need cash to meet immediate needs, that’s been my goal from the start,” Romney said in a tweet Thursday night. “The current bill has promise but it shouldn’t give lower earners smaller checks — that’s directly contrary to my proposal. We need to fix this to ensure lower earners get equal payments.” Senate Republican aides are signaling they’re open to making changes during negotiations.  Meanwhile, Democrats are calling for expanded unemployment insurance and paid leave, as well as more assistance for hospitals. White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland reiterated that the administration wants to see lawmakers pass the package by Monday. “Hopefully we’ll be done in a relatively quick fashion,” Ueland told reporters Friday, adding the administration is “looking for swift action, swift conversation, swift resolution and hopefully swift accomplishment by Congress on behalf of the American people.” In addition to Ueland, Trump administration officials participating Friday include former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  The Republican senators attending the talks are McConnell, Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.), Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Senate HELP Committee Chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Senate Aging Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine), Small Business Committee Chair Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Senate Commerce Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).  Among the Democrats participating are Schumer, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore), Senate Small Business Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) , Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.). Senate HELP Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray is participating by phone.  Lawmakers are trying to move as quickly as they can and are expected to work through the weekend. McConnell has vowed the Senate will not leave Washington until a deal is reached.

"Larry Edgeworth, a longtime NBC News employee, died Thursday after being diagnosed with the coronavirus, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told staff in a memo Friday morning. Edgeworth most recently worked in an equipment room at NBC News' 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York, ""but prior to that he spent most of his 25 years at NBC News as a skilled audio technician, often traveling to the most remote locations,"" Lack wrote in his memo, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.  ""Many of you were fortunate enough to work with Larry over the years, so you know that he was the guy you wanted by your side no matter where you were,"" Lack wrote. Employees were notified on Wednesday that Edgeworth had tested positive for COVID-19, but his identity was withheld at the time for privacy reasons. Edgeworth's wife said he ""suffered from other health issues that led him to succumb to the illness,"" Lack wrote. Edgeworth is survived by his wife, Crystal, and two sons. ""We are doing everything we can to support his family during this very difficult time,"" Lack wrote. The announcement of Edgeworth's death prompted fond remembrances Friday from NBC News reporters and colleagues. Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent, described Edgeworth as a ""gentle bear of a man"" and the ""heart and soul of our extended NBC family."" ""I was always cheered and reassured knowing he was on the team in the field. He always had my back whether here in the U.S. or in the most dangerous situations around the world,"" Mitchell said in a statement.

"Mike Bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, a dramatic investment from in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. The money will support the DNC’s “Battleground Build-Up 2020” program, the DNC’s initiative in 12 swing states across the country. The money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. “This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot,” DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. The DNC has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure Donald Trump is a one-term president.”  The massive transfer signals a change of plans for Bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super PAC to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. ""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,' an unsigned memo circulated by the Bloomberg campaign read. ""The dynamics of the race have also fundamentally changed, and it is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party’s general election efforts."" A press release accompanying the memo said that staff in six battleground states will be ""employed and paid"" through the first week in April and have ""full benefits"" through the end of that month. Bloomberg would not be able to give the DNC such a massive sum of money as a regular donor. But presidential candidates are allowed to transfer unlimited amounts to their national party committee — though usually those candidates have raised the money from donors operating under campaign finance limits. Bloomberg self-funded his whole presidential campaign from his personal fortune. The memo from Bloomberg’s operation said that it would be transferring the money, and a Democratic official noted that federal candidates’ campaign committees can transfer an unlimited amount of money to a party committee. This, however, has rarely if ever been done with a candidate who exclusively self-funded their own campaign. “They put money into their campaign with the full intent of winning the nomination, and put it in before Super Tuesday,"" Graham Wilson, a lawyer for the DNC, said. He argued the transfer was not “not breaking new ground on the law.”  A Bloomberg spokesperson said that the transfer would appear on the campaign’s next FEC filing in April, meaning the money was transferred sometime this month. The Bloomberg campaign also announced that it would transfer “several” of its former field offices to state parties.",Bloomberg makes massive $18M transfer from campaign to DNC,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/mike-bloomberg-massive-18m-transfer-dnc-138771,politico
"Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on Friday asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review stock sales he made weeks before the markets began to tank in response to the coronavirus pandemic — a move designed to limit the fallout from an intensifying political crisis. Burr, who chairs the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, defended the sales, saying he “relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks"" and disputed the notion he used information that he was privy to during classified briefings on the novel coronavirus. Burr specifically name-checked CNBC’s daily health and science reporting from its Asia bureau. “Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” Burr said in a statement. Burr, who is retiring at the end of 2022, has faced calls to resign from across the ideological spectrum since ProPublica reported Thursday that he dumped between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 33 different transactions — a week before the stock market began plummeting amid fears of the coronavirus spreading in the U.S.  The North Carolina Republican has also come under fire for a secret recording obtained by NPR from Feb. 27, in which he issued a much more dire warning to a group of attendees at a private luncheon about the potential outbreak than the prognosis he was offering publicly at the time. Both liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson have called on Burr to step down. Carlson said ""there is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time of crisis"" and said Burr should resign and face prosecution for insider trading, if the report is true. Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, said it was ""stomach-churning"" that someone would think to ""profit off this crisis."" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is up for reelection this year in the Tar Heel state, didn’t go so far as to ask for Burr’s resignation, but did say Burr owes an explanation — and the pending Ethics probe now gives Tillis, and others, some cover to call for the investigation to play out. “Given the circumstances, Senator Burr owes North Carolinians an explanation. His self-referral to the Ethics Committee for their review is appropriate, there needs to be a professional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter, which the Ethics Committee can provide,” Tillis tweeted. The Ethics Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), is made up of three Republicans and three Democrats. The panel is notoriously slow and rarely takes punitive action against its peers, but with the Capitol focused on battling coronavirus — and some members limiting their interactions or being forced to go on self-quarantine — the probe could move at even more of a snail’s pace. Burr has acknowledged making at least one financial decision based on what he’s heard from federal officials: he said in 2009 that he encouraged his wife to withdraw cash from the ATM after hearing from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson amid the 2008 financial crisis. If Burr traded stocks based on information that was not available to the public, it could not only be an ethics issue, but a criminal matter as well. The 2012 STOCK Act prohibits members of Congress from insider trading. Former Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role in an insider trading case. Collins was a major investor in Innate Immunotherapeutics and even pitched the stock to fellow members. But Collins allegedly told his son about the firm's failed drug trial months before it was public, allowing his family members to dump their shares before the stock collapsed. Burr's committee was receiving regular classified briefings on coronavirus at the time of the stock sales, according to Reuters, but Burr has insisted that he used public reports to make investment decisions. In an initial statement, a spokesperson for Burr confirmed the transactions but noted they took place before the market volatility. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,"" his spokesperson said. ""As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy."" Burr also punched back at the NPR report on Twitter Thursday, calling it a ""tabloid-style hit piece"" and noting it was a publicized event that included ""many non-members, bipartisan congressional staff, and representatives from the governor’s office."" Burr is not the only one under scrutiny for their recent trading practices: Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sold off more than $1 million in stocks in the days and weeks following a private coronavirus meeting — then bought shares in a company that offers teleworking software, according to the Daily Beast. Loeffler, who is on the ballot this fall, was a wealthy business executive before being appointed to Congress late last year and is married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. “This is a ridiculous and baseless attack,” Loeffler wrote on Twitter. “I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement.”",Burr moves to quell fallout from stock sales with request for Ethics probe,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/sen-richard-burr-requests-ethics-probe-into-his-stock-sales-138768,politico
"The deadline for filing tax returns will be postponed three months, to July 15 because of the coronavirus outbreak, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced today. The decision comes after complaints over the administration’s previous plan to give people who owe the IRS an additional 90 days to pay, without penalties or interest, yet still require them to file returns by April 15. Many called that plan confusing, with lawmakers on both sides urging the administration to synchronize the dates. Tax preparers, meanwhile, said social distancing guidelines related to the pandemic would make it hard for many to meet the April 15 deadline. People may not be able to gather needed documents or confer with accountants. And services like the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance clinics — which help low-income people file returns — have been curtailed or closed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Senate Republicans unveiled plans Thursday to postpone the filing deadline as part of their stimulus legislation now pending in Congress.  At President Donald Trump’s direction, Mnuchin tweeted, “We are moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15. All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties.” He urged people expecting refunds to file ""now to get your money.""

"The Trump administration has held up $40 million in emergency aid Congress approved earlier this month to help American Indians combat the coronavirus — a delay that’s left tribal leaders across the nation frustrated and ill-equipped to respond to the fast-growing outbreak. The funding has languished in bureaucratic limbo for weeks, despite increasingly urgent pleas from tribal organizations desperate to stockpile essential supplies and keep health clinics operational. Federally run American Indian health facilities are well short on hospital beds and ventilators, some frontline clinics received fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests, and federal officials have already signaled there will be little in the way of reinforcements — telling tribal leaders that all they can send right now are expired respirators. That’s fueled alarm throughout American Indian country and on Capitol Hill, where advocates warn the administration has done comparatively little to protect American Indians as it plans drastic action elsewhere to protect vulnerable populations and slow the virus’ spread. “We’re already the poster child for the most vulnerable populations in this country,” said Stacy Bohlen, the CEO of the National Indian Health Board, which represents tribal governments. “This is not the place you want to skimp on resources if you want to hold the tide on this disease.” The funding holdup is the latest hiccup in the federal government’s response to an outbreak that is poised to overwhelm American health care. It’s also a setback for the Indian Health Service, the $6 billion health agency primarily responsible for serving roughly 2.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, more than a quarter of whom are uninsured. The IHS has come under fire over the last several years for poor medical care, untrained staff, leadership turnover and, more recently, an investigation over reports that it failed to prevent a pediatrician from sexually assaulting young patients despite repeated warnings. An IHS spokesperson told POLITICO that the agency is working with HHS and the CDC to determine how best to allocate the $40 million, but did not provide a timeline for distributing the funds. There are four confirmed coronavirus cases among American Indians so far, and on Thursday, a Cherokee Nation citizen became the first person in Oklahoma to die from the virus just a day after testing positive. “For months, we watched this virus from afar,“ said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. “We hope people understand this has now hit home and is a very real pandemic that can affect anyone of us.” But a widespread shortage of tests has largely prevented tribes from monitoring for the virus, which they worry could spread rapidly through their tight-knit communities. And most American Indians and Alaska Natives now live in urban areas, where American Indian health organizations are already running low on medical supplies and funding. In hard-hit Seattle for example, one health center anticipates losing $734,000 a month during the response effort — assuming it doesn't first run out of supplies and be forced to close. Other frontline urban American Indian facilities reported receiving fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests. The initial $8.3 billion coronavirus response package President Donald Trump signed into law March 6 allocated $40 million to help support American Indian care providers. Administration officials have since touted to tribal leaders the cash infusion as extraordinary for its inclusion of urban American Indian organizations and indicative of how serious Washington is approaching the outbreak. Yet the money remains hung up as officials at IHS and the CDC debate how to solve an obscure appropriations hurdle. Congress initially allocated the aid as grants through the CDC, despite warnings from tribal organizations and some House staffers that it could invite bureaucratic snafus, two people with knowledge of the process said. Congressional appropriators say they inserted specific language to avoid issues and ensure tribes were eligible for the funding.  “We checked with CDC when we were finalizing the language,” said Evan Hollander, a spokesperson for the House Appropriations Committee.  But the CDC has since told tribal organizations that it can’t distribute the funds because it doesn’t have the necessary funding relationship with the IHS hospitals, tribal-run health facilities and urban American Indian organizations that are supposed to receive it. Tribal leaders said the CDC has also balked at their idea to set up an inter-agency transfer that would deliver the money to IHS directly, questioning whether it has the authority for such a transfer A CDC spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the funding, saying only that the agency is working across the administration and with tribal organizations to “finalize a plan to allocate these funds and maximize public health impact and reach to tribal populations.” The IHS has also said there's another problem. Even if it received a direct funding transfer from the CDC, it could not simply hand over the money to tribes and urban American Indian organizations because the legislation structured the funds as grants, which requires a more complex process. Federal officials haven’t yet offered other alternatives for freeing up the money, and have remained vague about the funding’s status in conversations with tribes. “Health providers across Indian Country are risking their lives on the front lines of this crisis,” said Meredith Raimondi, a spokesperson for the National Council of Urban Indian Health, which supports health services for American Indians living in urban areas. “We don’t know what the delay is.” The delay comes as the Trump administration races to pour resources into the broader national response, promising a “whole-of-government” effort aimed at reinforcing frontline hospitals and ramping up production of ventilators and face masks. On a conference call last Friday, IHS officials, led by chief medical officer Michael Toedt, told House and Senate staffers that the agency’s health system had 625 hospital beds available nationwide, including just six ICU beds and 10 ventilators, according to three people with direct knowledge of the discussion. There are another 772 beds available across tribal-run health programs, he said, according to one person on the call. Tribes rely heavily on IHS facilities, which provide many health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives for free. Over a quarter of the tribal population in the U.S. is uninsured, more than double the national rate. Toedt days later reportedly revised IHS’ capacity figures on a press call for media outlets that cover Native issues. But IHS also warned at least one Hill office that the agency doesn’t have accurate information readily available because reporting is optional for tribal programs, and IHS was still collecting data from its regional offices, according to a person briefed on the call. IHS has since told POLITICO that as of Thursday, the agency had 37 ICU beds and 1,257 hospital beds across both IHS facilities and ones run by tribal organizations themselves, as well as 81 ventilators. Pressed further on IHS’ readiness, one IHS official characterized the agency as a “shoestring operation.” At another point, Toedt downplayed the threat by telling staffers that “IHS believes this virus will be slower to reach Indian country,” according to a person on the call. “It was quite scary, to be very frank,” said the person, who left the discussion shaken. Another person on the call blamed chronic underfunding of the IHS for the agency’s dire assessment. “They’re working out of a hole that is so deep it’s really kind of unfathomable,” that person said. An IHS spokesperson noted that the agency’s annual budget is less than one-sixth what tribal leaders estimate is needed to fully fund the American Indian health system. When asked about Toedt’s comments on the virus’ spread, the spokesperson emphasized that IHS has “always been clear that this is a rapidly evolving situation.” The IHS has also made few promises to organizations running low on critical protective equipment and medical needs, just as the rest of the health care industry struggles to stock up ahead of an expected wave of patients. Unlike states, American Indian organizations cannot easily draw on the federal Strategic National Stockpile designed specifically to aid the response to a public health emergency. Instead, the IHS told tribal organizations in recent weeks that its National Supply Service Center, created in 1981 to aid tribal needs, will release two models of respirators to help bridge the gap. However, it warned, the respirators are already expired. IHS confirmed those details, telling POLITICO that the broader health department is “inundated” with supply requests from all over the country. “To address ongoing nationwide shortages IHS has offered, at no cost, N95 respirators that have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life, in accordance with CDC guidelines,” the IHS spokesperson said. The CDC has said expired N95 respirators may offer more protection than surgical masks. In a survey published Tuesday by the National Indian Health Board, just 16 percent of its tribal leaders, providers and partners reported receiving federal resources of any form to aid the response. Even fewer — 4 percent — had received basic protective equipment. “We don't know what this really looks like,” Bohlen said of the virus’ impact on Indian country. “Because we don’t have the tools necessary — like the rest of America — to figure out what is going on here.”",Exclusive: Emergency coronavirus funds for American Indian health stalled,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-american-indian-health-138724,politico
"The 1.3-million member United Food and Commercial Workers union endorsed Joe Biden today, giving the former vice president another boost as he seeks to finish off the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The union’s endorsement came after Biden this week swept primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. In a written statement to POLITICO, UFCW President Marc Perrone said Biden is best equipped to help guide vulnerable service workers through the coronavirus crisis.  “At a time when UFCW members in healthcare, food retail, packing, and processing are on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, the vice president has again stood by our side by calling for paid leave and designating these brave workers as first responders,” Perrone said. On Thursday Biden encouraged states to classify grocery store workers as emergency personnel, making them eligible for certain benefits like free child care. UFCW adds to a growing list of union endorsements for Biden, including the National Education Association, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and the International Association of Fire Fighters. Initially reluctant to endorse any candidate in the crowded primary, unions have lately been rallying around Biden as he gains a commanding delegate lead. “In good times, UFCW workers are critical to keeping our families well-fed and well-supplied,“ Biden said in a written statement. “Their employers and our entire country should rally around these workers and ensure they receive the benefits and protections they need.“  Biden was one of several candidates to show up at UFCW picket lines in Boston last year to support striking Stop & Shop workers.",Biden lands food workers' endorsement,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/biden-lands-food-workers-endorsement-138727,politico
"House minority leader Kevin McCarthy complained Thursday that the decision by his homestate governor to institute a statewide shelter-in-place order was premature and made without input from other state leaders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Thursday ordered nearly 40 million residents to stay home, making it the first state to order the restrictive mandate as coronavirus cases surge across the U.S. The order is effective immediately and remains in place “until further notice,"" the governor said. ""We do think there was an ability to do this without shutting down the entire state,"" McCarthy told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday. ""I hope he consulted with a lot of experts before he just made this decision."" McCarthy, whose California district includes Bakersfield and the San Joaquin Valley, said his state produces ""essential things"" necessary for the national coronavirus response. And the state's massive population, he suggested, could have an outsize impact on the already struggling U.S. economy when it stays home en masse. ""You know how serious this virus is and how contagious it is. But California is 12 percent of the nation's population. There are essential things that are produced in California that when you think of the pharmaceutical industry and others based in San Francisco,"" McCarthy said. ""I would have thought the governor would have called a number of us to consult and talk to us why he would make this decision. I know I never did get a call from him. Maybe he feels there's a need behind it."" Under Newsom's order, Californians can leave home for essential purposes such as purchasing groceries, prescriptions, health care, and jobs deemed essential. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who issued the same order for his city hours before Newsom's statewide measure, saw the action as necessary for preventing overwhelmed hospitals in coming days.  ""We wanted to act quickly, and I'm so glad our governor acted for the entire state because the data showed us very clearly two days for some cities, maybe six to nine days for others, we are all about to be overwhelmed in our hospitals,"" Garcetti said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""But things we can do right now allow us all to be first responders and potentially take this fate of this virus in a different direction."" But Garcetti said residents are still encouraged to go outside, visit parks and go hiking while abiding by the order — a measure the mayor predicts will last for a couple of months.  ""You can go out, just don't go out with a group of your family to get things at the grocery store. Don't pack yourselves together in a car. Really abide by this,"" Garcetti said.  He continued: ""This won't just be a couple of weeks. In my opinion it will be at least a couple of months. I know that that's really jarring and tough for folks initially. But I do think people will come together in a way, remember those things that we love and those people we love in a way we haven't done for a long time.""",McCarthy complains he wasn't consulted ahead of California's shelter-in-place order,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/kevin-mccarthy-slams-gavin-newsoms-stay-at-home-order-for-californians-138690,politico

Big donors' stock portfolios are tanking. And small-dollar, online contributors — who have never been more important to campaigns — are facing sudden financial uncertainty and the real possibility of unemployment.  The severe economic shock from coronavirus could upend the 2020 election. And Democrats see themselves as having more to lose: President Donald Trump bungled the early days of the coronavirus crisis, they say, and while that could cost him politically, the tanking economy will hurt Democrats’ ability to raise the money challengers need to campaign for the White House and other offices in 2020. Trump’s well-stocked reelection campaign has less to lose amid the current financial uncertainty than does Joe Biden, who is emerging from a costly primary, they argue. Major donors from both parties already are beginning to scale back after years of riding high off of a booming stock market, donors and fundraisers told POLITICO.  ""I’m personally postponing anything where more than two people need to get together until we have an understanding of what the dangers are. And in terms of spending money, I’m trying to cut back as much as possible,"" said Democratic megadonor and philanthropist Bernard Schwartz, who has given at least $2.8 million to Democratic causes this cycle, including helping a pro-Biden super PAC.  Biden and Trump are starting to work donors via the phone and video meetups, while anxiety rattles through congressional campaigns and some organizations grow nervous about whether they will be able to stay in the black.  It won't take long until campaigns feel the sting, said Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, which supports down-ballot candidates.  ""I think the thing people don’t realize is that campaigns and organizations — both political and nonprofits — don’t keep that much cash on hand,"" Litman said. ""You’re running month to month. One bad month, you can make it through. Two or three, and it can be catastrophic."" Run for Something has canceled events through mid-June, which Litman estimated will cost the group $450,000, approximately 25 percent of its budget for the year. Both Trump and Biden, who is just beginning to gear up for a general election as the coronavirus rocks the United States, are trying to keep growing their campaigns. And the committees and campaigns associated with House and Senate candidates have canceled almost all upcoming events, they told POLITICO. “Safety is more important than fundraisers or negative ads,” Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “In-person fundraisers have been canceled and that will affect our bottom line. And we couldn't care less.” “This decision will cost us money,” Scott Fairchild, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote in an email to online donors explaining the committee was canceling all events. “A large chunk of our fundraising is going to dry up. And to compensate for this shortfall, our Democratic Senate campaigns will need the support of this online community more than ever.” Trump’s campaign has canceled a slew of events, including a pair of highly anticipated fundraisers featuring Melania Trump — her first for the reelection campaign — this week in Beverly Hills and next week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump also last week canceled a trip to Las Vegas for a fundraiser hosted by casino mogul and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “Trump’s fundraising juggernaut is certainly going to slow a bit as the country focuses on survival,” said Republican donor Dan Eberhart. “It may not be evident today, but campaign fundraising is certain to take a hit like every other sector of the economy. There is too much uncertainty for large and small donors alike.” Both Trump and Biden will keep raising money online and via “virtual fundraisers,” held most often through video conferences with donors. Biden has one such virtual event scheduled for Friday. (The transition hasn’t always been easy: The Biden campaign postponed one such event scheduled for this week in New York City amid technical difficulties, CNBC reported.) Earlier this week, the Biden campaign distributed a fresh list of incentives to its top fundraisers to try to keep money flowing in: perks for bundlers who raise $25,000 to $500,000 for the campaign. A fundraiser who raises $25,000 for Biden, known as an “Advocate,” gets “direct contact with Regional Finance Director” and “Inclusion in national leadership councils.” People who raise more money for the campaign — including the $250,000 “Scranton Circle” and the $500,000 “Philly Founder” — receive more perks, including “bi-weekly update calls with campaign leadership” and invitations to quarterly and annual finance committee events. “It may become more 'social distancing' or more draconian down the road, then eventually people will realize we need to move forward with the campaigns as well. Some of that means resources,” said John Atkinson, a Chicago-based bundler for Biden. Meanwhile, some big-name Democrats expected to spend huge sums on 2020, including Silicon Valley investor Ron Conway and businessman Mike Bloomberg, have turned their attention to combating coronavirus. Neither Conway, nor Bloomberg has announced plans to scale back on politics, but to some, the 2020 election suddenly seems like a more distant priority than a few months ago. Todd Schulte, president of the Mark Zuckerberg-backed FWD.us, implored lawmakers to use their small-dollar donor lists for advocacy instead of fundraising in an email to supporters about helping with coronavirus, obtained by POLITICO.  “Use your email lists,” Schulte wrote. “I don’t think I got a single email saying call X member and demand ‘more kits everywhere, mass investment in medical capacity, $1000 to every American, mandatory sick leave, and more.’ No one is going to give much online -- to you or your opponent,” Schulte wrote. Some candidates are letting their small-dollar donors off the hook. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn) included a note to donors about the financial toll the emergency is taking in fundraising emails. “It’s okay not to donate right now,” one email from Smith read. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is now running for Senate, and MJ Hegar, a Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, gave donors the ability to temporarily opt out of fundraising emails during the emergency. Not every candidate, though, has abandoned raising money in person.  GOP fundraiser Alexandra Kendrick said that while the vast majority of her clients have canceled fundraisers — including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was slated to host a weekend donor retreat in Napa next weekend — two candidate clients are currently planning on going forward with their events. “If it’s me and them sitting at a table with a chicken sandwich, so be it,” Kendrick said. “It’s not about the money, I think. It’s about the routine for them.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report.",'It can be catastrophic': Coronavirus tanks campaign fundraising,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-campaign-fundraising-138381,politico
"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown America’s electoral system into shock, prompting officials in six states so far to move presidential primaries as the federal government urges people not to gather in large groups. Connecticut became the latest state to push back its vote on Thursday, and even more states are considering delays. Meanwhile, election officials are also gaming out the changes they can make to voting systems to allow Americans to participate in elections while keeping themselves safe and preventing the spread of the virus. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has urged states not to postpone their primaries and instead embrace expanded voting by mail. But Perez has little authority over how individual states conduct their elections. 23 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and other territories have yet to vote in the presidential contest, and we are tracking developments in every one as the calendar shifts and states puzzle through when — and how — people can vote. Here’s what has happened so far in all the states that were scheduled to vote from mid-March through the end of April. Connecticut (moved from April 28 to June 2) Gov. Ned Lamont announced on March 19 that the state’s primary would be moved to June 2. “In coordination with other states and our Secretary of the State, and in an effort to carry out Democracy while keeping public health a top priority, I have decided to move our presidential primary to June 2nd,” Lamont tweeted. Connecticut law only allows voters to cast ballots by mail with a valid excuse, but Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said avoiding coronavirus should be considered a valid excuse for absentee voting in the state. “Secretary Merrill has determined that for reasons of public health, absentee ballots that are requested to avoid public gatherings at polling places are requested because of illness, and should be validly issued,” a statement from her office on March 13 read. The statement said she is asking Lamont to issue an executive order allowing voters to request a ballot because of an ""illness"" during this emergency instead of ""his or her illness."" Georgia (moved from March 24 to May 19) Georgia was one of the first states to postpone its primary, moving it to May 19. “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement on March 14. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices. Indiana (moved from May 5 to June 2) Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb announced that his state would postpone its May 5 primary until June 2. ""It needed to be pushed back in order to, again, ensure the safety of our county employees, our poll workers and the voters themselves,"" Holcomb said at a March 20 press conference. Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson also said she'd recommend to the state election commission that they suspend absentee balloting rules to allow all Indiana voters to vote absentee should they so choose, along with other recommendations that would make it easier for Hoosiers to vote. Indiana typically requires an excuse to vote via mail-in absentee ballots. Lawson said the recommendation would only apply to the June 2 elections. Lawson said the election commission would meet March 25 to discuss the proposals. Louisiana (moved from April 4 to June 20) Louisiana also postponed its presidential primary, delaying its election until June 20. Notably, Louisiana's new date moves the primary outside of the nominating contest window set by the Democratic National Committee, meaning the state could have its number of delegates cut unless the DNC changes or waives its current rules. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement on March 13. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" Kentucky (moved from May 19 to June 23) Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear jointly agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement.  Maryland (moved from April 28 to June 2) Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan postponed the state’s primaries to June 2 in response to the coronavirus. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said at a March 17 press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process in our state.” One election will still be held on April 28 in the state: The special election in Maryland’s 7th District to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. That election will be mail-in only, and it could be an important test: Activists and some politicians are pushing for mail-in elections to be more widely adopted nationwide as part of the response to the coronavirus outbreak. Ohio (delayed from March 17 to June 2) Ohio was supposed to hold its primary on March 17. But Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration backed a court case to delay the election for public health reasons the day prior, and after a judge ruled the primary should go on, DeWine and his public health director shut down polling places due to a “health emergency.” Following the closure, Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying the primary was postponed until June 2 and prohibiting county election authorities “from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. But that doesn’t mean June 2 is set in stone. Ohio’s state legislature is set to meet starting on March 24 to take action on the primary, The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported, with leaders noting that they have the power to set election details. ""The legal authority to change the date rests with the Ohio General Assembly,"" House Speaker Larry Householder wrote in a memo. ""No Ohio voter should ever wonder when they will have the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote."" Meanwhile, the Ohio Democratic Party filed a lawsuit over the move, looking for clarity for the new primary: “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election. So authority for a new election must come from the legislature or from a court,” party chair David Pepper said. The party’s lawsuit, effectively, asks for a mail-in primary through April 28. Wyoming (April 4) The Wyoming Democratic Party canceled the in-person portion of their caucuses in response to coronavirus. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Alaska (April 4) Alaska Democrats have not made changes to their party-run primary, which already had a significant mail-in component already. Alaska voters who were registered as Democrats by Feb. 18 had ballots mailed to them that need to be postmarked by March 24, with in-person voting scheduled for April 4. A spokesperson for the state party told POLITICO that the party was “currently in the process of reaccessing” the procedure and said changes were coming soon. Delaware (April 28) Delaware is, for now, continuing on as planned with its election.  “Governor [John] Carney's team is working closely with Elections Commissioner [Anthony] Albence, and we are continuing to move forward with planning, for now,” Carney spokesperson Jon Starkey wrote in an email to POLITICO. “We will continue to move forward — with plans to take additional health precautions to keep Delawareans healthy — until guidance from our public health experts makes clear we cannot safely hold the election on April 28.” Hawaii (April 4) Hawaii's party-run primary has not been postponed. However, the primary is conducted largely by mail (as are state-run elections), so it may be able to continue as usual without significant disruption. New York (April 28) Discussions about moving New York’s primary have begun, but there is nothing definitive yet. Douglas A. Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, told The New York Times on March 15 that the presidential primary could move to June 23 (the date of other primaries in the state), but that decision would have to be made by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature. But Cuomo said he has not given any thought to the idea yet. “I have virtually no political thoughts at this time and no thought about postponing an election,” he said at a March 17 press conference. However, Cuomo has already delayed all village elections in New York until April 28. “Public health officials have been clear that reducing density is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread, and delaying village elections will help ensure poll workers and voters are not potentially exposed to the virus and at the same time maintain integrity in our election system,” he said in a statement on March 16. Pennsylvania (April 28) Gov. Tom Wolf said the state is considering moving its primary. “I’m not sure what impact it’s going to have on the primary,"" Wolf said at a press conference on March 16. “Obviously, we want to keep people safe, so to the extent that the state needs to move the April 28 date to another date, other states have already done this, Pennsylvania is certainly taking that into consideration.” However, it is not entirely clear if Wolf has the authority to do so on his own. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the clearest way to move the primary would be for the state legislature to do that — but there’s no consensus among lawmakers. Wolf may be able to use his emergency powers to move the primary. Puerto Rico (March 29) Puerto Rico is on the verge of rescheduling its primary. At the request of the island’s Democratic Party, the Puerto Rico Senate passed a resolution on March 16 pushing the primary until April 26, with the potential to further postpone the primary at a later date if the emergency persists. A statement from the party on March 16 said the Puerto Rico House of Representatives is expected to also pass the bill, and Gov. Wanda Vazquez has indicated she will sign the bill. Rhode Island (April 28) Election officials in the state are split on what to do. The state board of elections voted on March 17 to ask Gov. Gina Raimondo to postpone the presidential primary from April 28 to June 2 — but Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea’s office is recommending the April 28 primary stay in place as a “predominantly mail-ballot” election. The governor’s office told the Associated Press that Raimondo was “open to the idea” of moving the primary following the board’s vote. Wisconsin (April 7) Wisconsin is in a tougher situation than other states: Not only is the presidential primary scheduled for April 7, but so are general elections for state and local offices, including state Supreme Court and mayor of Milwaukee. Gov. Tony Evers has beaten back calls to postpone the election. ""How long do we potentially leave offices unfilled because we’re into July or August and we haven’t held a general election?"" he asked reporters on a conference call on March 17, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Evers has urged voters to vote absentee. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Democratic Party and the DNC have filed a lawsuit to expand voting access. The suit seeks to extend electronic and mail registration to April 3, axe photo ID and residency document requirements for absentee ballot and registration requests, and extend the mail-in deadline to count votes postmarked by Election Day and received within 10 days of the election. Mark Jefferson, the chair of the state GOP, put out a statement: “The best course of action during elections in times of crisis is to ensure equal access to the polls, not to suspend all common-sense regulations that ensure fair elections in a democracy,” he said. “We call on local election officials to make early-voting available immediately and we are exploring what legal options may be available. Suspending rules that ensure fair elections is simply not an acceptable solution.” Alice Miranda Ollstein and Elena Schneider contributed reporting.",Everything to know about states moving and changing their primaries over coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/state-elections-primaries-changes-coronavirus-138393,politico
"President Donald Trump called himself a ""big fan"" of an unproven coronavirus treatment Friday and repeatedly contradicted his own top health officials on how much is known about the drug's potential to help at least some patients affected by the pandemic. “It is very effective. It is a strong drug,” Trump declared at a long, sprawling televised briefing, referring to a malaria drug that is in the early stages of being tested against Covid-19. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and other White House task force members appeared visibly uncomfortable as Trump repeatedly hailed the drug's promise. A day earlier, a similar scenario unfolded in the White House briefing room as FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn tried to tamp down Trump's confidence and explained the many steps that scientists have to go through before they know a treatment is safe and effective for a particular condition. ""We want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered,"" Hahn said of chloroquine's effectiveness. Chloroquine is one of several medications — some already on the market for other diseases, some still in the clinical pipeline — that are being tested to see if they can treat the novel virus, to make it less severe. Scientists in several countries around the world, some part of a multinational WHO effort, are undertaking studies of whether the drug, used for malaria and arthritis, can help save lives from this disease. But the existing research Trump was so enthused about is very preliminary, as Fauci painstakingly explained several times on Friday. Basically, the science done to date shows that it's worth investigating further — but it doesn't prove much on its own about its effect on Covid-19. The United States is obtaining ""millions"" of doses for further study and for ""compassionate use"" — letting doctors try the unproven drug on very sick people. Scientists can collect data if a drug is given under compassionate use rules — though not as fully as in a clinical trial. While the malaria drug has a fairly good safety profile; no medication is without some risks. And it's completely unknown whether it's safe for people who are dangerously ill with coronavirus. Researchers don't yet know when to administer it, or at what doses. It may work best right after someone is infected, or could be most effective only if someone is already critically ill. In the best case scenario, it will take months to know whether, as Fauci said Friday, it's “truly safe and truly effective” with this disease. That didn't stop the president. “Right now, in terms of malaria, if you wanted, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. And by the way, it's very effective. It works,” he told reporters. Fauci, who has had to strike a delicate balance between providing accurate information and avoiding contradicting his boss, cut back in. “You have to be careful when you say ‘fairly effective,’” he pleaded. “It was never done in a clinical trial.” The tense back-and-forth in the White House briefing room echoed the FDA's Hahn's similar attempts earlier this week to downplay the president's optimistic claims of readily available drugs to treat the new virus. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" Hahn said. “We need to make sure the sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patients, at the right dosage, at the right time.""",Trump hypes unproven coronavirus drugs as top science officials manage expectations,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-hypes-unproven-coronavirus-drugs-139525,politico
"Mike Bloomberg’s shuttered presidential campaign alerted staffers on Thursday night that two floors of its New York headquarters were exposed to the novel coronavirus. On Friday morning, the campaign then laid off hundreds of staffers across the country, including at least several dozen in the New York office who are potentially at risk and are now being asked to finish their employment working from home. While staffers in battleground states have health coverage until the end of April, the dismissed Bloomberg employees in the New York City headquarters will lose health insurance after March 31. In an email sent at 11:03 pm Thursday, with the mundane subject line “Building Update - 229 West 43rd Street,” the campaign’s human resources department wrote: “We’ve just become aware of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the office at 229 West 43rd Street impacting the 5th and 8th floor.” The campaign wrote that the individual was last in the office on Monday, March 16.  The campaign recommended employees work from home for the next two weeks, spurring panic among some staffers given their health insurance will end in just 11 days.  “Think about the potential of someone getting hospitalized on April 1, without coverage, fighting for their life and now being strapped with massive medical debt,” said a staffer in headquarters who fears they were exposed and shared the email with POLITICO. “The campaign's refusal to extend health care benefits is unconscionable and putting people at grave risk. This is not how you treat people who sacrificed a lot to work for you.” The Bloomberg campaign declined to say whether the individual who tested positive was a campaign employee or someone outside the campaign who had access to the building. Bloomberg, whose estimated worth is more than $50 billion, rapidly assembled the largest campaign staff in the Democratic field after his late entry last fall. He offered large salaries along with promises those who signed on they would be paid through November regardless of whether Bloomberg became the nominee. But after his presidential campaign fizzled, Bloomberg signaled that many of those staffers would only be paid through March 31st but would also potentially be able to work for a well-funded Super PAC. But on Friday, Bloomberg announced that he was abandoning those plans as well and informed hundreds of employees that they would no longer have a job.  The moves infuriated Bloomberg staffers who felt cheated and afraid to be without a job as the economy likely heads toward a severe recession and the pandemic makes health care coverage essential. “I guess it’s cheaper to give the DNC $18 million than keep promises because @MikeBloomberg just fired his whole campaign staff — including those of us promised jobs though November on his IE,” Amol Jethwani, a former aide, wrote in a tweet. “Disappointed I don’t have a job. Not surprised that a billionaire is cheating scum.”",Laid-off Bloomberg staffers exposed to coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-staffers-exposed-to-coronavirus-139466,politico
"President Donald Trump heaped scorn on several members of the White House press corps at a coronavirus briefing Friday, but made a point of responding to questions from a new reporter in the briefing room: His former press secretary. “Mr. President, two questions if you would indulge me,” Sean Spicer said when Trump pointed a finger to call on his former aide. Spicer, of course, is the former White House and Republican National Committee spokesman who vigorously defended Trump’s inauguration crowd size claims and regularly tangled with reporters during combative White House briefings before his ouster in a 2017 shakeup. He also took a spin on “Dancing With The Stars.”  Spicer now has his own political talk show for the conservative Newsmax TV outlet. By the time Trump entered the White House Briefing Room to address reporters Friday, Spicer was set to press his old boss for presidential reaction to small business anxieties and reports that senators unloaded stocks before a pandemic-sparked market downturn. The surreal scene played out moments after the president castigated NBC’s Peter Alexander for suggesting that Trump may be giving Americans “a false sense of hope” about coronavirus treatment, asking what he would say to Americans who are scared or sickened by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. “I say that you are a terrible reporter. That's what I say,” Trump told Alexander. “I think that's a very nasty question, and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers, and they are looking for hope. And you are doing sensationalism.” Trump’s attacks on the news media are a familiar tactic at his campaign rallies and press conferences. After a brief détente earlier this week, the president lashed out at the media again during Thursday’s briefing. Friday's spat with Alexander, juxtaposed with Spicer’s presence on the other side of the podium, further heightened the strains with the press corps.  Ultimately, Trump used Spicer's questions to praise his administration's response to small businesses hammered by the outbreak and defend senators who reportedly sold stock before markets tanked in response to the pandemic, though he made sure to call out only one of them — a California Democrat — by name. ""I saw some names. I know all of them. I know everyone mentioned,"" Trump replied to Spicer. ""Dianne Feinstein, I guess. And a couple of others. I don't know too much about what it's about, but I find them to all be very honorable people. That’s all I know. And they said they did nothing wrong. I find them — the whole group, very honorable people."" Friday's exchanges didn't sit well with some other reporters. ""What the president did to Peter Alexander is reprehensible,"" CNN anchor John King declared after Friday's press conference.  ""It was striking that this came, this, forgive me, bullshit attack on fake news came just moments after the secretary of State said the American people have to be careful about where they get their information and go to sources they can trust.""",Sean Spicer debuts as White House reporter during heated Trump coronavirus briefing,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/sean-spicer-coronavirus-white-house-briefing-139471,politico
"President Donald Trump on Friday shot down the prospect for any kind of nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, resisting a step that California and New York have already taken. “I don't think so,” Trump told reporters Friday when asked whether California's strategy could be adopted nationwide.  Trump, who instead announced another series of mitigation efforts spanning the federal government, argued that California and New York were exceptions. “Essentially you've done that in California. You've done that in New York. Those are two hotbeds,” he said. But, he added, “you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they're watching it on television, but they don't have the same problems. They don't have by any means the same problem.” While the president said he would continue to work with governors, “I don't think we'll ever find that necessary,” he said of a nationwide lockdown. Even as his administration has ramped up its coronavirus response, Trump has appeared hesitant at times to take steps that would further kneecap a U.S. economy that is already in an unprecedented freefall. Even without a nationwide lockdown, millions of Americans have already essentially self-quarantined, posing a mortal danger to the service and hospitality industries and threatening to thrust the entire U.S. economy into a recession. The dramatic economic slowdown has prompted talks between the White House and Congress not just on a massive bailout package for suffering industries but also of plans to cut checks to individual Americans. Taken together, costs for the government's economic response are expected to soar past $1 trillion dollars. What Trump did announce was that he had finally put the Defense Production Act, which would allow him to order private corporations to manufacture desperately supplies, “into high gear,” days after saying he would not yet trigger the Korean War-era statute. But aside from name-checking General Motors, the president declined to say what companies he had ordered into action and how many items he had ordered. He also announced the partial closure of the U.S.-Mexico border to nonessential travel, a move that mirrors the closure of the northern border with Canada earlier this week. Trump rolled out a number of new measures aimed at providing relief to American consumers as well, saying the Education Department would allow federal student loan borrowers to suspend payments for at least 60 days and that the IRS is pushing back its deadline to file taxes by three months. The president and his coronavirus task force were repeatedly questioned throughout the nearly 90-minute briefing on everything from their failures to produce widespread access to test kits for the respiratory illness to health care workers' unmet pleas for personal protective equipment or treatment machines like ventilators.  But a day after saying it was states’ responsibilities to procure supplies, and that the federal government was not a “shipping clerk,"" Trump signaled a move to nationalize the supply chain and improve the allocation of resources for health care providers. He announced that FEMA would take over emergency response, asking governors to coordinate with their regional FEMA administrators.  Experts had urged such an approach because the federal government has powers to boost production that states do not and a federal approach can allocate scarce goods to the places that need them most, not just the state that calls up manufacturers fastest. Trump alluded to that dynamic on Friday. “We need certain equipment that the states are unable to get by themselves,” he said. “So we're invoking [the Defense Production Act] to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need, like the masks, like the ventilators.”  Still, the new approach appeared to be uneven. Asked about concerns raised by Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker a day earlier that the federal government was outbidding states for critical supplies, Trump acknowledged such occurrences but contended that ""smart"" states call and tell the government to withdraw its bid. Trump insisted that there were “millions” of supplies, including masks and ventilators, heading to states. And while he did not offer many details on that front, manufacturing giant 3M announced during the briefing that it has doubled its global output of coveted N95 respirator masks since the outbreak began, increasing its output “to an annual rate of over 1.1 billion per year, or nearly 100 million per month.” But the president also wrongly suggested entities like shuttered car factories could be retrofitted instantaneously to accommodate the need for supplies, a reconfiguration that in reality could take almost a year.  “We're getting calls from automobile companies. We're getting calls from other companies saying they have plant capacity,” Trump said. “They want to make ventilators, they want to make other things. We are literally being besieged, in a beautiful way, by companies that want to do the work.”  The task force also continued to defend its coronavirus testing lags, with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announcing that FEMA would stand up “a laboratory task force to answer” questions about a lack of supplies for tests like cotton swabs.  “Usually it's the lab people do not understand there are actually alternative supplies in the marketplace, that they are perfectly free to use,” he said, saying that the government had just purchased 200,000 swabs on the open marketplace that they were sending to governors. “It's a complex system with 330 million Americans and all of these labs,” Azar explained. “So sometimes there's a lab that doesn't understand how much flexibility they have and how much supply there is out there. We're working through the new FEMA integration center to help correct that for folks.”",Trump on a nationwide lockdown: 'I don't think we'll ever find that necessary',2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-coronavirus-nationwide-lockdown-139330,politico

"Mike Bloomberg’s defunct presidential campaign laid off hundreds more staffers Friday as he announced that that he’s folding his massive battleground operation into the Democratic National Committee. Many of the Bloomberg aides — including those purged in an initial round of dismissals—were holding out hope he would deliver on a promise to keep them on his payroll through November, particularly with the coronavirus baring down. But those hopes were also dashed Friday when the staffers were told in frank conference calls that Bloomberg would not move ahead with his planned super PAC, and instead would cede his state operation to the DNC, including an $18 million infusion to help presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The staffers, who said they were lured to the late-starting campaign with yearlong guarantees of competitive pay and health benefit packages, were invited to apply for jobs with the DNC as part of a “competitive process.”  “I guess it’s cheaper to give the DNC $18 million than keep promises because @MikeBloomberg just fired his whole campaign staff — including those of us promised jobs though November on his IE,” Amol Jethwani, a former aide, wrote in a tweet. “Disappointed I don’t have a job. Not surprised that a billionaire is cheating scum.” Several other former aides said in interviews that the news comes as a massive blow amid the tanking economy. They believe the campaign has repeatedly strung them along while misrepresenting future opportunities. “I am disgusted by Mike Bloomberg and his staff,"" one of the Bloomberg aides, who like several others spoke on the condition of anonymity, told POLITICO on Friday. ""He has left us with no health insurance during this pandemic. I have a family and do not know what we will do at the end of the month.""  The person added, ""If the DNC and Joe Biden choose to ignore us, they are complicit as well. How can the party claim to care about working Americans while taking money from a billionaire that does not fulfill his promises to his employees?” POLITICO previously reported that Bloomberg was laying off hundreds of staffers around the country and paying them through March 31, though they would be allowed to keep their Bloomberg-issued iPhones and MacBooks (which would be taxed as income). But the campaign indicated at the time that those staffers would be given priority to apply for jobs in six battleground states that were to be funded by the planned super PAC. Those already working for him in the battleground states had planned to stay on his payroll to work on the nominee’s behalf. A planned internal staff conference call with those employees Wednesday was kicked over to Friday, when they, too, were told that Bloomberg was pulling out and they’d lose their jobs.  Pennsylvania State Director Kevin Kinross, on a separate call with his staff in the state Friday, called the edict “disappointing and (an) abrupt end to everything.” Kinross said he suspected that it was a small group decision. “To have people sort of twisting in the wind for all this time when you literally have the resources to make up the rules however you want them to be,” Mustafa Rashed, the communications director in the state, added on the call. “I feel bad for the people who moved their lives, their selves, their family to come to Pennsylvania or any other state to work and then to be uprooted during the midst of a global pandemic, I don’t know, it’s not good.” Several aides who asked to remain anonymous because of non-disclosure agreements they signed with Bloomberg said the perk of being paid all year was what motivated them to join the campaign in the first place. Some said they had yet to receive promised relocation expenses.  Others pointed to the millions Bloomberg is separately sinking into coronavirus response efforts as tone deaf at a time when aides who worked long hours in call centers on his behalf will have to foot their own costs. A Bloomberg spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the DNC Coordinated Campaign is hiring in the six battleground states. “And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to, including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible,” the spokesperson said.  Additionally, they said staff in the six battleground states that were let go Friday would be employed and paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April.  “This is the largest contribution from a campaign to the DNC in recent history,” they said. “Although Mike suspended his campaign, he remains committed to defeating Trump and we hope all our staff submit their names for positions with the DNC Coordinated Campaign this transfer will help fund.”  The spokesperson did not immediately confirm how many staffers were let go Friday or in the previous round. But Bloomberg had more than 2,000 people spread out across the country and hundreds more at his New York headquarters.  Bloomberg dropped out after a disastrous showing on Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden. Bloomberg’s hiring materials from headquarters shared with POLITICO stated that regardless of what happened to his own campaign, field organizers could expect to have a job with “Team Bloomberg” through November, though it didn’t promise interviewees where they would be based. It outlined that organizers would be paid $6,000 a month, plus a $5,000 relocation stipend and full health, dental and vision benefits. In one staff email, an aide cited Campaign Manager Kevin Sheeky’s March 6 note in which he pasted a news report reiterating plans to keep field operations going in the half-dozen battleground states regardless of whether Bloomberg became the nominee. A spokesperson confirmed that was the plan after the first round of layoffs earlier this month. The pledge was so well established in some non-battleground states that it was used as a frequent motivator by supervisors to encourage sometimes exhausted staffers. It was also raised in at least two statewide training sessions where officials traveled from headquarters. On the Pennsylvania call, a woman asked Kinross whether the state campaign knew whether the DNC was going to try to keep people who have uprooted their entire lives to the state of Pennsylvania. “No, we don't, we don’t ...There’s no answer,” he replied. “All the decisions are going to be the DNC’s.”",Bloomberg lays off hundreds as coronavirus bears down,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-campaign-layoffs-coronavirus-139362,politico
"The Republican National Committee has rehired a prominent consulting firm it axed after it allowed a massive data breach in 2017. The committee paid $700,000 to Deep Root Analytics last month, according to a senior party official. The expenditure is expected to be reflected on the committee’s next finance report, to be released Friday. Following the 2016 election, the Northern Virginia-based media consulting firm took responsibility for accidentally exposing the personal information and political dispositions of nearly 200 million Americans, or around 60 percent of the country’s population. At the time, Deep Root Analytics served as a vendor for the RNC and, along with several other firms, helping to develop highly refined voter data. The data — which included names, birthdays, and personal addresses — was discovered in June 2017 on an Amazon web server by the cyber risk firm UpGuard. UpGuard described the mishap as “perhaps the largest known exposure of voter information in history.” The RNC moved swiftly to separate itself from Deep Root Analytics and the firm locked down the information to prevent further public access. Republican officials say the data was unsecured for around two weeks and that other than UpGuard no one gained access. RNC officials said the firm has taken aggressive steps to address the past failure, such as upping its investment in cybersecurity, bolstering employee training, and updating its security measures.  People familiar with the new arrangement say the firm's work for the committee is focused on data analytics and media-tracking projects. “The RNC has and will continue to take the security of voter information extremely seriously. Over the past three years, Deep Root has overhauled their security protocols and maintains a robust security posture,” said Mike Reed, an RNC spokesman. “We are confident that their system is safe and secure.” The move comes as President Donald Trump’s political operation beefs up its data infrastructure ahead of the general election. The Trump campaign has functioned largely as a digital-focused effort. Under campaign manager Brad Parscale, who served as digital director on Trump’s 2016 bid, the president’s political organization has undertaken projects such as gathering data on attendees at his rallies.  Alex Lundry, Deep Root’s co-founder, previously worked on Mitt Romney’s 2012 bid. He has specialized in the targeting of television advertising. The RNC was not the only organization Deep Root Analytics contracted with during the 2016 election cycle. The outfit worked for Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Right to Rise, an outside group that supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign.  While the RNC cut ties with the Deep Root Analytics during the 2018 midterms, the firm worked for a range of party groups including the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the House GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund.  This cycle, the outfit’s clients include McConnell and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both of whom are seeking reelection. “Since 2017, Deep Root has satisfied the security requirements of over 100 different organizations and has done work for every major center-right political entity. We have the best product in the business and are excited to be working with the RNC in this cycle,” Lundry said in a statement. Separately, the RNC has tapped Howler Insights, LLC, a subsidiary of Deep Root Analytics, which shares office space with the firm. Party officials say Howler is at work on a data project that will play a role in the 2020 election.  According to campaign finance records, the RNC paid $900,000 to Howler in September. The disbursement was first reported by ProPublica.",RNC rehires firm responsible for massive data breach,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/rnc-deep-root-analytics-hire-138889,politico
"The Trump administration is bringing back former chief economist Kevin Hassett, whose grim public comments about the potential economic toll of the coronavirus stand in sharp contrast with some of the rosier predictions floated by current White House advisers. Hassett, who will be working as a temporary unpaid adviser, left his post as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in June after nearly two years in the job. While at the White House, Hassett was a vocal promoter of the administration’s tax cuts and stood behind President Donald Trump’s assurances that the economy could achieve sustained 3 percent annual growth. But the once-upbeat economist has taken a darker view of the potential fallout from the pandemic, which has shuttered businesses across the country and ground much of the world to a halt. “The odds of a global recession are close to 100 percent,” Hassett told CNN this week, adding that GDP could shrink by 5 percent in the second quarter and the next employment report could show 1 million job losses — a single-month setback that would be unprecedented in the post-World War II era. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has struck a more optimistic tone, saying as recently as Thursday that the economic damage from the outbreak would be short-lived.  Hassett is currently the vice president and managing director of the Lindsey Group.",White House to bring Hassett back as economic adviser amid crisis,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/white-house-to-bring-hassett-back-as-economic-adviser-amid-crisis-139345,politico
"The federal judge hearing House Democrats’ suit to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns put the case on hold today. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden, in his order, cited uncertainties about how another court may act in a different case that raises issues similar to the ones in the suit for Trump’s returns. In that second case, House Judiciary Committee Democrats are appealing a ruling that former White House counsel Don McGahn can defy a congressional subpoena for his testimony. McFadden wrote that he “will await further proceedings in McGahn” before he acts on Democrat’s subpoena enforcement claims in the tax returns case or their argument that a federal law requires the Treasury secretary to turn over the returns to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.).  In a filing last month, attorneys for Neal told McFadden they would continue to press their case despite the ruling in the McGahn case.  Trump’s lawyers said the tax returns case should be dismissed, but they’d be willing to see the case put on hold while the McGahn ruling is appealed.",Judge puts hold on Democrats' suit for Trump's tax returns,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/judge-puts-hold-on-democrats-suit-for-trumps-tax-returns-139325,politico

"Automakers are offering up their factories to help solve the shortage of ventilators needed to treat an expected crush of coronavirus patients, but production likely won't begin for months — too late to help ease the immediate need. Hours after Detroit’s big three automakers — General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Fiat Chrysler — announced Wednesday that they were shuttering their North American factories, at least two of them, Ford and GM, signaled that they might open them back up, but to make ventilators and protective medical equipment. The reason those factories shut down to begin with was partly due to pressure by the United Auto Workers, and local and state governments, to comply with social distancing guidelines to keep employees safe, and partly a product of plummeting demand for automobiles. “It’s all of the above,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. “Clearly, we want to have safe working environments. It’s also clear that retail sales and demand is falling off, and so the ability to be able to adjust production to current market realities is also important.” Both of those problems could be solved by reconfiguring the plants to manufacture ventilators and other items. “If you were to start a new production line making medical goods, from scratch, you could design [social distancing] into the line and for a lot of these, they’ll have to be made in medical clean rooms,” said Flavio Volpe, who heads the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association in Canada. “You’re addressing, by definition, a whole bunch of the concerns that employees have on the cleanliness and the spread in the workforce.” The push for automobile companies to begin helping the medical manufacturing industry comes as the country — facing a shortage of goods like ventilators, masks and other personal protective equipment for medical workers — shifts to a wartime footing to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Respirator manufacturing facilities in the United States are already at 100 percent production capacity and are looking to ramp up by another 15 or 20 percent, said Jim Jeffries, the senior vice president for public affairs for AdvaMed, which represents medical technology companies. He said in the medical industry, companies are adding third shifts and repurposing production lines, while also looking to other sectors — autos among them — to see if protective equipment can be “retrofitted” to help combat the crisis. “You’re seeing a really strong industry-wide mobilization to the fight,” Jeffries said. “They’re looking at literally every possibility to make sure that we can meet the demand.” But a spokesperson for General Motors underscored Thursday that there is no concrete plan yet to do anything. “This is very early,” said GM spokesperson Jeannine Ginivan. “Right now it’s just an internal feasibility study on whether it‘s possible for us to help out in the production of medical equipment.” She said the idea arose “in a conversation with the administration, when we were notifying them that we were going to be suspending production due to the virus.“ Questions about whether auto workers would be the ones making the devices, what facilities would be used or how they would comply with public health guidelines are still undetermined. Volpe said about a dozen Canadian auto parts manufacturers, many of which are currently idle because of the shutdowns of U.S. vehicle plants, are now running “due diligence” exercises to see what level of ventilator production is possible. “We’re trying to get something done in two or three days that might normally take a year,” he said. “We hope to be there by next week where we’re looking at engineering specs and hopefully within a month to two months, pumping out the critical goods at the volumes that the healthcare infrastructure needs.” Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted Wednesday: “We will make ventilators if there is a shortage,” despite widespread warnings that there was, indeed, a shortage. Tesla closed its factory in Fremont, Calif. the next day. President Donald Trump invoked a Korean War-era statute Wednesday, the Defense Production Act, that would allow him to order private corporations to manufacture desperately needed masks and ventilators to combat the coronavirus. However, though he has called up the statute, he has yet to trigger its use, saying he would ""if we were desperately in need of something."" He highlighted masks and ventilators in particular, and suggested he'd make a decision in the coming days. “We, frankly, will know about that very shortly,” he said at a White House press conference. “We’re going to know a lot over the next two or three days. We’ll know a lot.” Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Joe Biden, have urged Trump not to wait any longer and deploy the authorities now. Jennifer Dukarski, an attorney with Butzel Long, said the production of items like masks and respirators could ramp up quite quickly, while ventilator production would take longer given the need to alter supply chains and acquire the necessary physical equipment for manufacturing. “We are probably looking at a couple of weeks, maybe longer, depending on what we’re ramping up to manufacture,” Dukarski said of ventilator production times. Other experts thought the administration would likely lean on existing medical device manufacturers first to turbocharge their production. Converting automotive factories is possible but would likely take much longer to get up and running, they argued. “Medium-term they could do grants to mobilize automobile factories to manufacture ventilators. But that can’t happen in a week,” said Jerry McGinn, who led Defense Production Act programs for the Pentagon under several administrations, in an interview. “It’s something they could do in six months or a year.”",Detroit won’t save us from a ventilator shortage anytime soon,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/detroit-wont-save-us-from-a-ventilator-shortage-anytime-soon-139272,politico
"The Labor Department asked state labor offices not to release data on unemployment claims before the information is incorporated into its national weekly statistics. The letter to state labor agencies Wednesday, first reported by the New York Times, notes that the jobless claims data ""is monitored closely by policymakers and financial markets"" and said state offices, when talking to the press, should confine themselves to using ""generalities to describe claims levels (very high, large increase)."" After DOL releases its weekly report, ""states may share information for the given week at the level of granularity deemed appropriate within the confines of federal and state confidentiality guidelines,"" the letter said. The memo, sent by Gay Gilbert, administrator of the Office of Unemployment Insurance, included a long list of exceptions to state reporting requirements in light of the coronavirus crisis. It is not unusual for the Labor Department to bar states from reporting unemployment data before federal announcements, given the market-moving potential. But some state officials say the requirement should be suspended while they work to limit economic damage.  “Every single hour counts, never mind a day or a week in our response to this,” said Suzi LeVine, the commissioner of Washington state’s employment security department . “And so my [in]ability to share that information, to put it in the governor’s hands and not have to worry about ‘oh don’t tell anybody this’ — that’s unacceptable right now.” DOL was not immediately available for comment.",DOL to states: Don't leak unemployment claim numbers,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/department-of-labor-tells-states-dont-leak-unemployment-numbers-139268,politico
"The scarcity of surgical face masks and other protective equipment for health workers has quickly become the most urgent problem facing those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. Manufacturers are ramping up production of masks, gowns and gloves, but there will be a lag before the new supplies can reach hospitals already struggling to care for infected patients. Earlier this week, Vice President Mike Pence called on construction companies to donate their dust masks — which are identical to the ones used by doctors and nurses — to their local hospitals. But there’s another source of protective medical equipment that hasn’t yet been discussed: Dentists and veterinarians. With the right financial incentives, dentists and vets can help bridge this critical gap. Dentists and veterinarians use the exact same personal protective equipment as other medical workers, and they adhere to rigorous OSHA guidelines for surgical masks, gloves, and various sanitization materials. With an estimated 200,419 dentists and 71,060 veterinarians in the U.S. workforce primarily in private practice, there exists an inventory of readily available medical equipment in dental and veterinary offices that could reinforce the strained supply chain. But here’s the problem: Most dental and veterinary offices are small businesses. Despite recommendations from the American Dental Association, many dental offices are staying open during the crisis; they share the concerns of fellow small-business owners in staying financially solvent and keeping employees on the payroll. Many are holding off as they await details of the small-business loans included in the Senate’s COVID relief legislation, to see if they can afford to close. Meanwhile, their valuable medical supplies—such as face masks—have not been redirected toward hospitals.  Rather than hope for goodwill, federal and state governments should quickly implement policies to incentivize dentists and veterinarians to contribute their medical supplies to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Here are two ideas for doing that:  A direct buyback program. Federal, state and local governments could offer to purchase personal protective equipment from dental and veterinary clinics and directly cut a check to the businesses. This would provide dentists and vets quick revenue at a time that they may be strapped for cash; this would allow them to close while redistributing their inventory to hospitals. While the ideal buyback program would be at market rate or cost-plus pricing, the costs of such a plan may be less politically palatable given the already high level of estimated federal spending on COVID relief and economic stimulus. An alternative would be for governments to offer to purchase the protective equipment at a percentage of Medicare rates instead. (A similar policy could also be implemented for individual hoarders of protective equipment, but at a lower rate to discourage their practice.) A “war bonds” style bond exchange. Historically, war bonds were federally backed patriotic debt securities purchased by citizens to finance the war efforts of World Wars I and II. Citizens purchased bonds to generate federal monetary supply in exchange for a guaranteed return on their security with interest at a lower rate. In echoing a war-time call to combat disease, modeling a similar initiative for protective equipment could incentivize donations faster and at lower cost to the government than a direct buyback. Here’s how a bond program could work: The government could set the value of a “COVID bond” at a discounted Medicare rate for the protective equipment and guarantee a set rate of interest. For example, if you donated $100 worth of masks, the government would issue you a bond currently valued at $80 with a guaranteed rate of 2.5% interest a year. At the end of a 15-year term, the bond would be valued at $115.86. Dentists and vets could either hold on to the bonds or, if they needed short-term capital, sell the bonds on a secondary market to other individuals for cash. These options would benefit both sides: Hospitals would receive a short-term influx of protective equipment, while private dental and veterinary offices could utilize the funds to cover fixed costs and offer employees leave. This way, dentists and vets could immediately contribute to addressing the public health emergency at a time when they are already seeing fewer patients already and benefit when demand and productivity resumes.  With hospital supplies nearing critical levels, the federal government must use creative policy tools to bolster dwindling supplies of protective equipment. Tapping existing inventory of masks, gowns and gloves in dental and veterinary offices can ease the shortage of personal protective equipment as we wait for supply chains to ramp up.

"President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he will allow the nation’s more than 42 million federal student loan borrowers to take a break from making their monthly payments, without incurring interest or penalties for at least the next two months. Trump also announced that he will let states waive federal testing requirements for elementary and high school students, both moves in response to the coronavirus pandemic. State leaders have been increasingly anxious about testing mandates as the coronavirus shutters schools across the nation. On student loans, in addition to suspending payments, the Education Department said it would set the interest rates on all federally held student loans to zero until at least May 12. That carries out Trump’s announcement last week that he was waiving the interest on student loans. Trump said student borrowers won't have to make loan payments “for at least the next 60 days and if we need more we’ll extend that period of time.” To obtain the 60-day reprieve, borrowers who have federally held loans will have to make a request of their loan servicers, such as Navient, Nelnet, FedLoan Servicing or Great Lakes, over the phone or online. But for borrowers who are already more than a month behind on their monthly loan payments, the Trump administration will automatically apply the 60-day suspension. More than 3.2 million federally-held student loans are more than 31 days delinquent and another 7.7 million are in default, according to the Education Department’s most recent quarterly data. “These are anxious times, particularly for students and families whose educations, careers, and lives have been disrupted,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. “Right now, everyone should be focused on staying safe and healthy, not worrying about their student loan balance growing.” The Trump administration’s announcement comes as Congress is also debating student debt relief as part of negotiations over the massive coronavirus stimulus package, S. 3548 (116). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan, released on Thursday evening, would allow the Education Department to suspend student loan payments for as long as six months. But Senate Democrats have said that doesn’t go far enough. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for canceling student loan payments made by borrowers during the national emergency and wants to guarantee borrowers at least $10,000 each in total loan forgiveness. Trump, speaking during a news conference at the White House on Friday, also teased additional announcements on student loans from his administration. “We have more to come on student loans, more good news for the students but we’ll do that at a different time,” Trump said. He also said the state testing waivers might be greeted by some K-12 students. “Probably a lot of students will be extremely happy, some probably not,” Trump said. “The ones that work hard, maybe not, but it’s one of those things. Very unfortunate circumstances.”",Trump: Federal student loan borrowers can suspend payments for 60 days,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-coronavirus-student-loan-payments-139056,politico
"President Donald Trump announced Friday that the U.S. and Mexico have agreed to temporarily close the border to nonessential travel to curb the spread of the coronavirus. U.S. and Mexican officials have been in talks this week over how to work together in responding to the global pandemic while ensuring that bilateral trade and essential travel are not disrupted at the border. It’s a similar move to the U.S. and Canada’s decision on Wednesday to impose travel restrictions at the northern U.S. border. “Both countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus and ensure the commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a White House press conference. “The United States is glad to have a friend that is working side-by-side with us in the fight."" The U.S.' agreement with Mexico and Canada to restrict nonessential travel will go into effect on Saturday. Trump tied the partial border closure to his concern over the “thousands of unscreened and unvetted and unauthorized entries from dozens of countries” that border agents encounter on the job. “During a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants and to the public at large. Left unchecked, this would … overwhelm our healthcare system and severely damage our national security. We are not going to let that happen,” Trump said.  However, there are about 15,000 known cases of the coronavirus in the United States, while Mexico has less than 200 reported cases so far. Canada is approaching 1,000 confirmed cases. Experts say much of the spread in the U.S. at this point is occurring within the country -- not due to foreigners or international travel. Trump was also quick to emphasize that his administration is treating both Mexico and Canada the same in working together to combat the coronavirus. ""We are treating the borders equally, the northern border and the southern border. They're being treated equally. A lot of people say they are not being treated equally. They are,"" Trump said. Earlier this week, Trump said his administration plans to remove migrants and asylum seekers that cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally — a move that would be separate from the nonessential travel ban. He said he would invoke a law that allows the U.S. surgeon general to turn away people or goods to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. Pompeo and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard finalized details on the travel restrictions on Thursday night after frequent talks this week, sources familiar with the talks said. Ebrard, for his part, wrote on Twitter on Thursday night that he has pressed to ensure that measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus “don’t paralyze economic activity and that the border continues to be open to commerce and work.” Still, the coronavirus pandemic — and travel restrictions — could disrupt the more than $1.5 billion in U.S.-Mexico trade that takes place every day. “We’ve already seen it get more expensive for truckers to take loads of goods from the border up north,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) told POLITICO. Cuellar explained that a lot of truck drivers typically fly into Laredo and pick up loads of goods from Mexico at the border to distribute to retailers across the country. Laredo is already seeing significantly fewer truck drivers flying in, he said. But the Texas Democrat said he’s been assured by the Trump administration that trucks and trains will continue to cross the border to deliver goods between the two countries. “It’s been a top priority to ensure that while, yes, we help stop transmission of the virus, we still keep balance of trade — especially given that we trade with Mexico a million dollars a minute,” Cuellar said. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf assured that North American trade would not be affected by the U.S.' agreement with Canada and Mexico to partially close the border. ""Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce. Essential commerce activities will not be impacted. We will continue to maintain a strong and secure economic supply chain across our borders,"" Wolf said Friday. Meanwhile, Mexican officials have been working overtime to ensure that business goes on as usual between the two countries given that they are top trading partners.

"Top Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators — joined by senior Trump administration officials — kicked off talks Friday on a massive, third stimulus package to salvage the U.S. economy, with a goal by having a deal by the end of the day.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed to pass the new stimulus though the chamber by Monday, an incredibly fast pace that Republicans and White House say is needed to address the growing public-health emergency. McConnell is already preparing to take the procedural moves needed to make that happen.  The negotiations began in the historic Hart 216 room, where Supreme Court nominations and crucial hearings often are held, and then spread out to the Finance Committee's offices as four ""task forces"" and sub-groups met.  “I tasked these bipartisan teams to reach agreement by the end of the day today, tonight,” McConnell said. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we’ve agreed to … We’ll need tomorrow for Legislative Counsel to draft the agreement. And as [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin] has indicated, it is important for us to be on the Senate floor and pass the measure by Monday.”  The four task forces — which covered distressed industries, small business, financial assistance to individual Americans and health care — took a ""pause"" in the middle of Friday afternoon while Republicans huddled for a policy lunch and Senate aides rushed to put the proposals into writing.   The high-level talks come a day after Senate Republicans introduced their $1 trillion stimulus package to save the U.S. economy by assisting individuals, small businesses and industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.   But Senate Democrats have already raised concerns with the GOP proposal, saying it benefits businesses and industries while not doing enough for working people.   “We need to work together quickly and do something big and bold that helps the American people,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), before the start of the meeting. “Sen. McConnell’s bill is not pro worker at all, it puts corporations ahead of people.”  Senior Democratic aides, however, said privately that they believe that McConnell's Monday deadline is still feasible.  Schumer, who spoke to President Donald Trump Friday morning, asked the president to use the Defense Production Act for more medical equipment, including ventilators, according to Schumer’s spokesperson.   After speaking with Schumer, Trump said he had an “extremely good” conversation with the minority leader and expressed optimism about the “Phase 3” stimulus deal.   ""We were working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will,” Trump said at a daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. He didn’t address the Defense Production Act.  Trump added that he also spoke at length with McConnell as well. Abd Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke also by phone with Mnuchin on Friday afternoon to discuss the state of play on the “Phase 3” package.  Among the key provisions of the Senate GOP package is a plan to provide direct cash payments to individuals of up to $1,200 and families of up to $2,400, based on income. In addition to direct cash payments, the GOP stimulus plan gives small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans and $200 billion for loans for industries, including airlines.   The structure of the direct payments has emerged as a concern for some Republican members. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has panned the idea of direct cash payments broadly, while Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are calling for the package to be fixed, after expressing concern that its structure doesn’t sufficiently benefit lower income Americans.   ""Our goal is to create an income stream not just a one-time payment,"" Graham said on Thursday. ""The problem with direct cash is you're giving it to the people who have got their salary, they don't need extra money. There are people without money that need money.""  Senate Republican aides and White House officials are signaling they’re open to making changes during negotiations.  But Republican leaders also brought in Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to counter that argument. Scalia has argued in the closed-door sessions that some states unemployment insurance systems aren't capable of handling both an expected tidal wave of new unemployment filings by Americans who just lost their jobs while at the same time gearing up to send out millions of checks.  ""The administration has expressed, based on some feedback their getting from states, that that would take a very long time,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.C.). ""Again, we're trying to do something that's quick and gets an infusion of cash out there in a hurry, and the direct payments do that.""  There are also objections being raised to some of the industry specific bailout, as well as numerous business-related tax cuts offered by Senate Republicans. Democrats are objecting that the GOP bill is not ""worker friendly."" And Trump himself said he wanted to make sure their was language in the package preventing corporations from using federal aid for stock buybacks.  ""We have some fundamental disagreements on some of the liquidity provisions,"" said a Republican senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. We're trying to help not because we're interested in helping business ... as much as we’re just trying to help keep the economy moving and keep people employed.""  Meanwhile, Democrats are calling for expanded unemployment insurance and paid leave, as well as more assistance for hospitals.  White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland reiterated that the administration wants to see lawmakers pass the package by Monday.  “Hopefully we’ll be done in a relatively quick fashion,” Ueland told reporters Friday, adding the administration is “looking for swift action, swift conversation, swift resolution and hopefully swift accomplishment by Congress on behalf of the American people.” In addition to Mnuchin, Scalia, and Ueland, administration officials participating Friday include former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Scalia.   ""Very good attitude, the children are playing well,"" Kudlow said when asked about the tenor of the discussions.   The Republican senators attending the talks are McConnell, Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.), Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Senate HELP Committee Chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Senate Aging Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine), Small Business Committee Chair Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Senate Commerce Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Thune.   Among the Democrats participating are Schumer, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore), Senate Small Business Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) , Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.). Senate HELP Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray is participating by phone.   Lawmakers are trying to move as quickly as they can and are expected to work through the weekend. McConnell has vowed the Senate will not leave Washington until a deal is reached.  ""There's been some good constructive discussions about the issues,"" Thune said. ""We're trying to narrow the list of the Democrat asks and the things Republicans want. We want feedback from the bill that we put out there ... We have about 12 hours to do it.""  Durbin, for his part, said Democrats ""proposed a number of new issues that have not been raised by the Republican plan."" Democrats want hundreds of billions of dollars for hospital and health-care providers that the GOP proposal doesn't presently include.  Schumer is closely consulting with Pelosi throughout the Senate negotiations. While Schumer is unlikely to agree to any major provision that Pelosi opposes, that doesn't mean House Democrats can't include additional initiatives when that chamber takes up the bill.  McConnell, however, has refused to include Pelosi in the negotiations so far, despite pleas from both top Democrats to do so.

"Larry Edgeworth, a longtime NBC News employee, died Thursday after being diagnosed with the coronavirus, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told staff in a memo Friday morning. Edgeworth most recently worked in an equipment room at NBC News’ 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York, “but prior to that he spent most of his 25 years at NBC News as a skilled audio technician, often traveling to the most remote locations,” Lack wrote in his memo, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.  “Many of you were fortunate enough to work with Larry over the years, so you know that he was the guy you wanted by your side no matter where you were,” Lack wrote. Employees were notified on Wednesday that Edgeworth had tested positive for COVID-19, but his identity was withheld at the time for privacy reasons. Edgeworth’s wife said he “suffered from other health issues that led him to succumb to the illness,” Lack wrote. Edgeworth is survived by his wife, Crystal, and two sons. “We are doing everything we can to support his family during this very difficult time,” Lack wrote. The announcement of Edgeworth’s death prompted fond remembrances Friday from NBC News reporters and colleagues. Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent, described Edgeworth as a “gentle bear of a man” and the “heart and soul of our extended NBC family.” “I was always cheered and reassured knowing he was on the team in the field. He always had my back whether here in the U.S. or in the most dangerous situations around the world,” Mitchell said in a statement. “His smile, his laugh, and his good humor were remarkable no matter how difficult the circumstances. He was a treasured colleague and I am terribly sorry for this unbelievable loss for his family.” “@NBCNews lost our gentle giant, our cheerleader, our sound man Larry Edgeworth to #coronavirus,” tweeted Anne Thompson, NBC News chief environmental affairs correspondent. “From Rome to the BP Oil Spill, he was the best colleague. We’d talk football and he loved the desserts I made, especially chocolate chip cookies. Love you Larry.” “I adored him,” tweeted Savannah Guthrie, co-host of NBC's “Today” show. “He was full of spirit and joy and humor. He was the pro of pros. We traveled in 2008 on a campaign plane for two months. He was a bright light every day. Larry, dear, we will miss u.” Kasie Hunt, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent, tweeted that she “first met Larry back in 2012 before I worked at NBC, and [he] was just the most warm and welcoming colleague to work with in the years since.” “I met him as the sound tech on our team that covered the Romney campaign in 2012. He called me ‘slim,’ and helped me put together my first resume tape,” MSNBC correspondent Garrett Haake wrote on Twitter. “He was SO proud of his kids. He was hilarious.”  Bill Karins, a meteorologist for the network, tweeted that Edgeworth “left 30 Rock a week ago today saying he didn’t feel well and then tested positive for” COVID-19. “Rest In Peace Larry,” Karins wrote.

"Mike Bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, a dramatic investment in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. The money will support the DNC’s “Battleground Build-Up 2020” program, the DNC’s initiative in 12 swing states across the country. The money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. “This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot,” DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. The DNC has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure Donald Trump is a one-term president.”  The massive transfer signals a change of plans for Bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super PAC to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. ""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,' an unsigned memo circulated by the Bloomberg campaign read. ""The dynamics of the race have also fundamentally changed, and it is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party’s general election efforts."" A press release accompanying the memo said that staff in six battleground states will be ""employed and paid"" through the first week in April and have ""full benefits"" through the end of that month. Bloomberg would not be able to give the DNC such a massive sum of money as a regular donor. But presidential candidates are allowed to transfer unlimited amounts to their national party committee — though usually those candidates have raised the money from donors operating under campaign finance limits. Bloomberg self-funded his whole presidential campaign from his personal fortune. The memo from Bloomberg’s operation said that it would be transferring the money, and a Democratic official noted that federal candidates’ campaign committees can transfer an unlimited amount of money to a party committee. This, however, has rarely if ever been done with a candidate who exclusively self-funded their own campaign. “They put money into their campaign with the full intent of winning the nomination, and put it in before Super Tuesday,"" Graham Wilson, a lawyer for the DNC, said. He argued the transfer was not “not breaking new ground on the law.”  A Bloomberg spokesperson said that the transfer would appear on the campaign’s next FEC filing in April, meaning the money was transferred sometime this month. The Bloomberg campaign also announced that it would transfer “several” of its former field offices to state parties.",Bloomberg makes massive $18M transfer from campaign to DNC,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/mike-bloomberg-massive-18m-transfer-dnc-138771,politico
"The Trump administration has held up $40 million in emergency aid Congress approved earlier this month to help American Indians combat the coronavirus — a delay that’s left tribal leaders across the nation frustrated and ill-equipped to respond to the fast-growing outbreak. The funding has languished in bureaucratic limbo for weeks, despite increasingly urgent pleas from tribal organizations desperate to stockpile essential supplies and keep health clinics operational. Federally run American Indian health facilities are well short on hospital beds and ventilators, some frontline clinics received fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests, and federal officials have already signaled there will be little in the way of reinforcements — telling tribal leaders that all they can send right now are expired respirators.  That’s fueled alarm throughout American Indian country and on Capitol Hill, where advocates warn the administration has done comparatively little to protect American Indians as it plans drastic action elsewhere to protect vulnerable populations and slow the virus’ spread. “We’re already the poster child for the most vulnerable populations in this country,” said Stacy Bohlen, the CEO of the National Indian Health Board, which represents tribal governments. “This is not the place you want to skimp on resources if you want to hold the tide on this disease.” The funding holdup is the latest hiccup in the federal government’s response to an outbreak that is poised to overwhelm American health care. It’s also a setback for the Indian Health Service, the $6 billion health agency primarily responsible for serving roughly 2.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, more than a quarter of whom are uninsured. The IHS has come under fire over the last several years for poor medical care, untrained staff, leadership turnover and, more recently, an investigation over reports that it failed to prevent a pediatrician from sexually assaulting young patients despite repeated warnings. An IHS spokesperson told POLITICO that the agency is working with HHS and the CDC to determine how best to allocate the $40 million, but did not provide a timeline for distributing the funds. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases among American Indians has risen in recent days, from four earlier this week to easily more than a dozen. The Navajo Nation has recorded cases 14 alone, and on Thursday, a Cherokee Nation citizen became the first person in Oklahoma to die from the virus just a day after testing positive. “For months, we watched this virus from afar,“ said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. “We hope people understand this has now hit home and is a very real pandemic that can affect anyone of us.” But a widespread shortage of tests has largely prevented tribes from monitoring for the virus, which they worry could spread rapidly through their tight-knit communities. And most American Indians and Alaska Natives now live in urban areas, where American Indian health organizations are already running low on medical supplies and funding. In hard-hit Seattle, for example, one health center anticipates losing $734,000 a month during the response effort — assuming it doesn't first run out of supplies and be forced to close. Other frontline urban American Indian facilities reported receiving fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests. The initial $8.3 billion coronavirus response package President Donald Trump signed into law March 6 allocated $40 million to help support American Indian care providers. Administration officials have since touted to tribal leaders the cash infusion as extraordinary for its inclusion of urban American Indian organizations and indicative of how serious Washington is approaching the outbreak. Yet the money remains hung up as officials at IHS and the CDC debate how to solve an obscure appropriations hurdle. Congress initially allocated the aid as grants through the CDC, despite warnings from tribal organizations and some House staffers that it could invite bureaucratic snafus, two people with knowledge of the process said. Congressional appropriators say they inserted specific language to avoid issues and ensure tribes were eligible for the funding.  “We checked with CDC when we were finalizing the language,” said Evan Hollander, a spokesperson for the House Appropriations Committee.  But the CDC has since told tribal organizations that it can’t distribute the funds because it doesn’t have the necessary funding relationship with the IHS hospitals, tribal-run health facilities and urban American Indian organizations that are supposed to receive it.  Tribal leaders said the CDC has also balked at their idea to set up an inter-agency transfer that would deliver the money to IHS directly, questioning whether it has the authority for such a transfer A CDC spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the funding, saying only that the agency is working across the administration and with tribal organizations to “finalize a plan to allocate these funds and maximize public health impact and reach to tribal populations.” The IHS has also said there's another problem. Even if it received a direct funding transfer from the CDC, it could not simply hand over the money to tribes and urban American Indian organizations because the legislation structured the funds as grants, which requires a more complex process.  Federal officials haven’t yet offered other alternatives for freeing up the money, and have remained vague about the funding’s status in conversations with tribes. “Health providers across Indian Country are risking their lives on the front lines of this crisis,” said Meredith Raimondi, a spokesperson for the National Council of Urban Indian Health, which supports health services for American Indians living in urban areas. “We don’t know what the delay is.” The delay comes as the Trump administration races to pour resources into the broader national response, promising a “whole-of-government” effort aimed at reinforcing frontline hospitals and ramping up production of ventilators and face masks. On a conference call last Friday, IHS officials, led by chief medical officer Michael Toedt, told House and Senate staffers that the agency’s health system had 625 hospital beds available nationwide, including just six ICU beds and 10 ventilators, according to three people with direct knowledge of the discussion. There are another 772 beds available across tribal-run health programs, he said, according to one person on the call.  Tribes rely heavily on IHS facilities, which provide many health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives at no cost under the federal government’s long-held trust responsibility. Over a quarter of the tribal population in the U.S. is uninsured, more than double the national rate. Toedt days later reportedly revised IHS’ capacity figures on a press call for media outlets that cover Native issues. But IHS also warned at least one Hill office that the agency doesn’t have accurate information readily available because reporting is optional for tribal programs, and IHS was still collecting data from its regional offices, according to a person briefed on the call. IHS has since told POLITICO that as of Thursday, the agency had 37 ICU beds and 1,257 hospital beds across both IHS facilities and ones run by tribal organizations themselves, as well as 81 ventilators. Pressed further on IHS’ readiness, one IHS official characterized the agency as a “shoestring operation.” At another point, Toedt downplayed the threat by telling staffers that “IHS believes this virus will be slower to reach Indian country,” according to a person on the call.  “It was quite scary, to be very frank,” said the person, who left the discussion shaken. Another person on the call blamed chronic underfunding of the IHS for the agency’s dire assessment. “They’re working out of a hole that is so deep it’s really kind of unfathomable,” that person said. An IHS spokesperson noted that the agency’s annual budget is less than one-sixth what tribal leaders estimate is needed to fully fund the American Indian health system. When asked about Toedt’s comments on the virus’ spread, the spokesperson emphasized that IHS has “always been clear that this is a rapidly evolving situation.” The IHS has also made few promises to organizations running low on critical protective equipment and medical needs, just as the rest of the health care industry struggles to stock up ahead of an expected wave of patients. Unlike states, American Indian organizations cannot easily draw on the federal Strategic National Stockpile designed specifically to aid the response to a public health emergency. Instead, the IHS told tribal organizations in recent weeks that its National Supply Service Center, created in 1981 to aid tribal needs, will release two models of respirators to help bridge the gap. However, it warned, the respirators are already expired. IHS confirmed those details, telling POLITICO that the broader health department is “inundated” with supply requests from all over the country. “To address ongoing nationwide shortages IHS has offered, at no cost, N95 respirators that have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life, in accordance with CDC guidelines,” the IHS spokesperson said. The CDC has said expired N95 respirators may offer more protection than surgical masks. In a survey published Tuesday by the National Indian Health Board, just 16 percent of its tribal leaders, providers and partners reported receiving federal resources of any form to aid the response. Even fewer — 4 percent — had received basic protective equipment. “We don't know what this really looks like,” Bohlen said of the virus’ impact on Indian country. “Because we don’t have the tools necessary — like the rest of America — to figure out what is going on here.”",Exclusive: Emergency coronavirus funds for American Indian health stalled,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-american-indian-health-138724,politico
"The State Department is beginning to put together charter flights for Americans stranded overseas during the coronavirus pandemic, with Morocco and Peru scheduled soon — even as others stuck in Guatemala took matters into their own hands. The rush to bring Americans home comes after the State Department announced a level four travel advisory Thursday, and amid reports of potentially thousands of Americans stuck in multiple countries without commercial flights or that had shut their borders. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a press briefing Friday that the agency is using ""all of the tools we can"" to bring Americans home, including a combination of commercial and private flights, and is talking to the Pentagon about using space on military aircraft.  He said State has put together a ""repatriation task force"" which is working on reports from individual citizens and members of Congress, and is urging stranded travelers to log in to the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. ""We'll track you and try to get everybody back,"" he said.  The first flights out of Morocco, which closed its borders on March 14, started Friday morning, according to the U.S. embassy there. U.S. citizens are able to hop a flight from Marrakesh for $1,485. The flights will stop in London before landing in 10 different U.S. cities. Stranded Americans — citizens and legal permanent residents only — must sign up by emailing [email protected]. Congressional offices were alerted of the flights Thursday night, according to one aide who received details via a State Department email. Congressional staff also received an email saying that Avianca Airlines, a Colombian air carrier, has created an online page where the hundreds of Americans stranded in Peru can sign up for flights home. Others, tired of waiting for the U.S. government to act, took matters into their own hands, in some cases crossing over the border from Guatemala into Mexico to catch flights that are still operating. Two people stuck in Guatemala, which has also closed its borders to flights, told POLITICO that they had purchased tickets from Avianca this week which were canceled, and that the airline had ignored their calls afterward. Avianca did not respond to a request for comment.  President Donald Trump also said Thursday that the U.S. military is working on getting people out of Peru, but didn't mention any other countries specifically. One group, who found each other online, had given up on the U.S. embassy and were discussing how to get rides to Tapachula Airport in southern Mexico, several told POLITICO. They asked for anonymity in order to discuss their situation openly. They've been sharing information in a group chat about where to cross the border, how to get a reliable ride, and how much the trip costs — including both paying a driver and the possibility of having to pay off Mexican customs officers.",U.S. starts some repatriation flights for stranded Americans ,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/us-starts-some-repatriation-flights-for-stranded-americans-138663,politico
"The vast majority of the super PAC millions backing Elizabeth Warren in the final days of her presidential campaign came from one person: Karla Jurvetson, a wealthy doctor based in the Bay Area who donated a massive $14.6 million to the main group that supported Warren.  In the last weeks of Warren’s struggling presidential bid, a super PAC called Persist PAC hastily formed and then swooped into Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday states to run over $14 million in ads trying to resuscitate Warren’s campaign. Warren was in trouble after third and fourth place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Jurvetson is one of the biggest donors in the Democratic Party and has spoken openly about what she feels is her obligation to support female candidates. ""I feel like it’s our moral duty, if we’re not going to run ourselves, to support the women who are brave enough to put their name on the ballot,” she told the Mercury News in 2018. Jurvetson also hosted a fundraising luncheon for Warren in 2018 — before the Massachusetts senator disavowed in-person fundraising events altogether during her presidential run.  Through a spokesperson, Jurvetson declined to comment on her involvement in Persist PAC, which only collected a half-million dollars from other sources in February, according to a new campaign finance filing. Warren did not respond to a request for comment.  After spending much of her campaign denouncing the corrupting influence of big money, Warren tried to justify the existence of the super PAC rather than demand that it take its ads off the air. Persist PAC was the biggest-spending outside group airing TV ads on Super Tuesday. “If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACs, count me in,” Warren said in Nevada, before she placed fourth in the caucuses there. “It can't be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don’t.” Warren’s message was noticeably different than just a few months earlier in the campaign, when a group affiliated with Jurvetson took out an ad in the Des Moines Register in Iowa. Warren spokesperson Chris Hayden told POLITICO in November that that the “campaign was not aware of this and asks that those involved immediately stop purchasing advertisements of any kind.”",Mystery Warren super PAC funder revealed,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/mystery-warren-super-pac-funder-revealed-140233,politico

"President Donald Trump is always keeping score. Sometimes it's a simple brag — boasting about the highest State of the Union TV ratings in history, trumpeting that he appointed more judges than George Washington, inflating the number of electoral college votes he won in 2016. But cherry-picked numbers are also central to how Trump comprehends a crisis and crafts a positive narrative. As the coronavirus raced around the globe and seized the world’s economy, he has cited numbers to suit his own story that the pandemic would quickly pass and that his administration was in control.  It’s a playbook that hasn’t always worked. In late February, Trump claimed there were only 15 coronavirus cases in the United States — a vast understatement — and promised “within a couple of days,” the number would be close to zero. That number has now soared past 14,000 and is climbing exponentially. He seized on figures about how many people the seasonal flu killed annually — 37,000 last year alone — without the country needing to shutter most businesses. His own health officials categorically rejected the comparison.  Then, Trump promised the administration would have 1.4 million coronavirus tests available by mid-March. But as of Thursday, only 100,000 people had been tested, causing one of the president’s top infectious disease experts to concede, “Clearly, more needs to be done.” Public health specialists say Trump’s use of misleading numbers to downplay the coronavirus outbreak — a challenge that could make-or-break his presidency — has had dangerous consequences, leading Americans to ignore official warnings about modifying behaviors to slow the disease’s spread.  “He's a man that hears what he wants to hears … and he puts it through the lens of a marketer. He is a marketer,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “His image is, ‘I’m on top of this, I’m tough,’ and anything he hears that supports that theory of the case, he grabs and utilizes.” Those around Trump disagree. They say his numbers-focused mindset is a crisis asset. Trump’s specific obsession with the number of coronavirus cases is the right approach, argued former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who made headlines when he insisted — wrongly — that Trump had drawn the largest ever inaugural crowd. “Having a metric-based business mentality is what you need during periods of crisis,” said Spicer, who visited the White House at least twice this week. “Either people are getting better and it’s being contained or it’s not. It’s the only judge of success.” Trump is obsessed with records, ratings and statistics, mentioning them constantly on seemingly every issue as he talks about what’s best — often inflating the numbers, often failing to acknowledge the human aspect, often overhyping his own role. There’s interest rates and unemployment rates, crowd sizes and polls, stock markets gains and immigrant apprehension numbers. Before running for office in 2016, Trump had spent his five decades in the real estate, marketing and reality TV businesses. He sold himself to voters on that background, touting his ability to strike deals with countries and companies alike.  Once in office, he talked about policy moves like one-off deals, often becoming preoccupied with certain figures. For example, he has constantly complained about trade deficits — when the value of what the country imports exceeds its exports — spouting off the amount with each country. $500 billion a year with China, $100 billion with Japan, $17 billion with Canada.  When Trump has struck new deals with China, Mexico and Canada and others, he’s always noted how much the agreement will reduce each trade deficit.  “When you’re in the real investment business, the performance is only based on numbers and that’s all that matters,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “He spent a lifetime on it. He’s not going to think differently now. That’s how you judge real estate. That’s all they have. It’s all about the money.” But Trump has been accused of forgetting the people behind the numbers. In August, Trump touted the crowd size of a rally — held at the same time as an event of then Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke —- while visiting medical staff who had treated victims of a mass shooting.  That criticism has resurfaced during the coronavirus pandemic. During the early stages of the outbreak, Trump mused about keeping coronavirus-infected passengers aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship in the waters off California to keep down the number of U.S. cases.  “I like the numbers being where they are,” he said. “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” Michael Caputo, who has known Trump for three decades and served as a campaign adviser in 2016, acknowledged Trump can be accused of being unfeeling, but compared it to how a statistician or economist might be criticised for being too focused on numbers and not people. But Caputo argued Trump has changed his approach as president.  “That’s part of the learning curve,” he said. “He has embraced the human side.” Caputo said toying with numbers is how Trump processes his options and reveals his thinking. “When global society is melting around him, he leans back on what he knows. Data is what he knows,” he said. “He muses, thinking aloud. My experience with the president he verbalizes all the options on the table and discusses every piece of data.” Trump’s political fixation on favorable figures goes back to his campaign. While on the campaign trail, Trump often talked about having a statistician he frequently called to get numbers about whatever he wanted. “You know, I have a person. He's a statistician. He's so excited by his job. He loves it,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M., in May. “I do like details and I do like statisticians,” he said at a Sacramento rally the following month. There was even a rally where he held up charts to illustrate what he said were the failures of President Barack Obama and his secretary of State, Hillary Clinton — Trump’s rival. There were charts on homeownership rates, the national debt, Syrian refugees entering the U.S., commuted prison sentences as well as hedge fund managers-turned Clinton campaign contributors and foreign donations to the Clinton family foundation. Trump’s rallies have continued during his presidency — until coronavirus, that is. And certain figures have become a recurring part of his stump speech.  He describes the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates are the lowest rate in history, though they have risen again. He claims seven million people have joined the workforce since he’s been president, though the gains are lower than Obama’s final three years. He said his administration has built 100 miles of new wall along the southern border, though most of that was simply upgrading existing sections. And he always talks about his 2016 electoral college vote total — which was 304, not 306 — without noting that Clinton won the popular vote.  “We were not supposed to crack 220, you know that, right?” Trump told a crowd in February 2017. “There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270.” Trump still talks about crowd sizes, boasting about the “record” numbers who have attended or watched from outdoor jumbo screens at the nearly 100 rallies he’s held as president. This less-consequential braggadocio has also surfaced during his near-daily coronavirus briefings.  On Sunday, Trump touted a stock market surge that occurred late Friday after he declared a national emergency to free up funds to combat the coronavirus.  “It went up 2,000 — almost 2,000 points,” he said. He wasn’t wrong, but by Monday the stock market plummeted again amid reports Trump had inflated the progress made fighting the virus — another fallout from his reliance on misleading figures during the coronavirus crisis.  An outside Trump adviser said Trump feels the need to offer up his record because he needs to justify himself against what he sees as the constant media attacks. “Numbers matter,” the person said. “That’s how you judge the status of things.

"President Donald Trump has pledged to “slash red tape like nobody has even done it before” to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine. But his push could backfire if the government moves too fast, according to public health officials and scientists with decades of experience in the field. In some cases, a vaccine that hasn’t been properly tested could make people sicker. And if there are complications, the public relations problems could mount, spurring an anti-vaccination sentiment. “There’s a lot of hope for a [coronavirus] vaccine but there obviously has to be a lot of caution,” said Kathryn Edwards, a Vanderbilt University pediatrician who helped test vaccines against whooping cough, pneumonia, flu and other diseases. NIH infectious disease leader Anthony Fauci has said it could take 12 to 18 months to make a vaccine available, but even that timetable could be overly ambitious. The most promising technologies haven't been tested on massive groups of people. And public health officials typically take their time when vetting vaccines targeted at millions. There are several examples of how fast-tracking vaccines can backfire. A massive campaign to vaccinate against the 1976 swine flu flopped when the disease turned out to be mild, but hundreds of people suffered a rare nerve disorder after vaccination. And a vaccine used in some European countries against H1N1 flu in 2009 caused some people to develop the sleep disorder narcolepsy. The Trump administration has already allowed one vaccine maker to begin testing its coronavirus shot in people before completing standard safety testing in animals — normally the first step in the long process of determining a vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The president wants to show that he is activating the full power of the federal government in pushing for the health care system to react, treat and find a vaccine. But the infrastructure of vaccine development is not conducive to political pressure or a runaway pandemic. And while no one is saying the current candidate vaccines are dangerous, they warrant dutiful examination “because in contrast to drugs, vaccines are given only to healthy people,” said Barry Bloom, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. “We have to be enormously careful not to harm anyone.” If there are harms, he added, “the antivaxxers can set back not only this vaccine but all vaccines.” A growing anti-vaccine movement contributed to the U.S. measles epidemic last year — the worst since 1992. Anti-vaxxers are already spreading conspiracy stories about the virus and predicting massive injuries from any vaccine, said Renée DiResta, who monitors such groups at the Stanford Internet Observatory. Most people will be eager to get vaccinated if the coronavirus continues on its terrifying course. Experts say the vaccine types with the best chance of early approval seem safe, though none has been licensed for human use. If properly warned of possible side effects, people might accept them in exchange for a shot that keeps them from getting sick or spreading the disease. Some even suggest it would be unethical not to accelerate the approval process at a time when the virus is killing thousands worldwide. “The normal development of a vaccine is long and large and defensive because you’re developing something to be given to healthy people, most of whom will stay healthy and will never need the benefit of the vaccine,” said Michael Watson, who has developed vaccines for 25 years — including at Moderna, which is working on a vaccine with the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “If you’re developing a cancer treatment, you can take quite a bit of risk for saving someone’s life. And the situation also changes when you’re in a global pandemic.” Still, it’s unclear how fast is too fast. Some scientists worry the Moderna vaccine could cause “immune enhancement,” a complicated reaction that makes a vaccinated person sicker when they catch the virus than if they hadn’t gotten the shot. NIAID said in a statement it was looking carefully for signs of this phenomenon in the Moderna trial. But agency scientists see little risk the experimental vaccine will cause the problem, it said. The government may face its first big regulatory decision in about four months, when NIAID and Moderna turn over data on the safety and immunity of their vaccine, which they began testing on the first of 45 individuals in Seattle on Jan. 16. The FDA would have the legal authority to promise emergency authorization of the Moderna vaccine based on a subsequent Phase II trial of a few hundred additional people. But that would be unheard of for a vaccine designed for massive use. Typically, such vaccines are tested on thousands in an area where there’s lots of disease, in order to directly measure how well the vaccine compares with a placebo. That process can take years. The possibility that the FDA could preapprove widespread emergency use before the side effects are fully understood, along with Trump’s eagerness, worries some of the dozen vaccine experts interviewed by POLITICO. “We seem to be willing to rush a vaccine into clinical trials without extensive animal model or safety testing,” said Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania immunologist who co-developed the rotavirus vaccine. “People are so scared of coronavirus that even those who are young and healthy will be willing to take a relatively untested product — even though the wild-type virus is unlikely to kill them.” Offit’s vaccine, which eliminates thousands of infant deaths each year, took 26 years from design to licensure. Red tape and delay can sometimes pay dividends in drug and vaccine approvals. Industry officials laid into FDA official Frances Kelsey in 1961 for her reluctance to approve their morning sickness drug thalidomide, but her sloth turned into a blessing. While Kelsey pondered the submission, news of crippling birth defects in thousands of babies poured in from Europe, and the FDA never approved the drug. During the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, federal officials decided not to approve vaccines that contained a new substance designed to boost the vaccine’s effectiveness. As a result, the United States was spared a controversy over an unpredictable side effect — narcolepsy — that struck people in Finland who got the newer shots. Some of the officials who made that decision had the 1976 swine flu fiasco on their mind. That year, after a new strain of influenza virus swept Fort Dix, N.J., the CDC became worried about similarities to the 1918 pandemic flu and convinced President Gerald Ford to order vaccines for the whole country. But the flu strain turned out to be relatively mild, and 450 people who’d received the vaccine got Guillain-Barré, a rare form of paralysis. Although later studies showed the vaccine was responsible for a minority of those cases, the debacle damaged trust in the government — and vaccination. To be sure, this is not 1976. ""The first and most obvious difference is, in 1976 we never had a disease. We know this is a dangerous virus — that's a day and night difference,"" said Harvey Fineberg, chair of the National Academies' Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases. “There are two dangers of history: Failing to learn the lesson, and overlearning the lesson,” said Fineberg, who co-authored the definitive study of the swine flu affair. The best approach, he said, was to “think one step beyond the next step, and decide what you need to decide when you need to decide it.” At a World Health Organization meeting Friday, the agency offered help to standardize tests and procedures for about 20 other target vaccines, said a scientist who attended the meeting by phone. Chinese military scientists are already testing their own coronavirus vaccine. “The range of approaches on the table is amazing in a positive way,” said vaccine developer Stanley Plotkin, an emeritus professor at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. “I’m optimistic that probably more than one of those approaches will work.” Plotkin’s rubella vaccine, which has prevented hundreds of thousands of cases of serious birth defects, is part of the MMR shot. It took six years to develop.",Why the push for a quick coronavirus vaccine could backfire,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/why-the-push-for-a-quick-coronavirus-vaccine-could-backfire-139854,politico
"A staffer in Vice President Mike Pence’s office has tested positive for coronavirus, Pence’s spokeswoman announced on Friday. “This evening we were notified that a member of the Office of the Vice President tested positive for the Coronavirus,” Katie Miller, Pence’s press secretary, said in a statement. “Neither President Trump nor Vice President Pence had close contact with the individual. Further contact tracing is being conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines.” The staffer was not immediately identified on Friday evening. Pence has not been tested for the virus, and his office said there were no plans to test the vice president at this time. The staffer adds to the growing list of White House and congressional personnel who have tested positive for the virus since the global outbreak reached heightened levels in the United States. President Donald Trump tested negative for the virus, his physician announced last Friday. Pence said earlier this week that he had not been tested. Several members of Congress have closed their Washington offices or gone into self-quarantine following positive diagnoses of the virus among staff members. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) were the first two members to test positive, on Wednesday. Several members of the president’s immediate circle were potentially exposed to the virus last week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where the White House hosted a delegation from Brazil, including President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus, but some of his aides have since tested positive — including one who was seated with Trump at a dinner at the resort. The White House has also been shifting more of its work online to limit person-to-person contact, and many staffers have opted to work from home. Temperature checks are now in place for all those coming in contact with Trump and Pence, and several programs and tours have been canceled. “In order to keep the entire White House complex safe and healthy, beginning Monday morning, temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters campus,” deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere said last week. “As was announced over the weekend, additional temperature checks will be conducted on individuals who are in close contact with the president and vice president throughout the day.” ",Pence staffer tests positive for coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/pence-staffer-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-139791,politico
"The federal agency that serves as an international multimedia broadcaster for the U.S. informed all employees of its first known coronavirus case about an hour after it knew. But the agency responsible for regulating civil aviation in the U.S. didn’t immediately tell technical operations employees about a positive test result at a Las Vegas airport, allowing them to continue working in a potentially infected area. Those employees, including technicians who had just completed their shifts, found out after a tower was evacuated.  Dozens of employees who work across the nation’s federal agencies have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, adding to the surging count of well over 10,000 confirmed cases in the United States. Experts expect the number of cases to continue rising as more tests are made available — and the federal government’s millions of employees are just as exposed as the American public at large. Meanwhile, hundreds, if not thousands, of other government employees have quarantined themselves either out of precaution or because they are exhibiting symptoms of the disease. But if the Trump administration has a unified policy on how it is handling the grim march of the virus within its own ranks, it isn’t sharing it.  Just as cities and states across the country have developed their own responses to the outbreak — from closing schools, bars, restaurants, movie theaters and a mix of other venues to encouraging curfews and issuing shelter-in-place orders — agencies across the federal government are crafting their own policies on how to disclose cases of coronavirus. The result is a confusing jumble of messages that has angered federal workers and those who represent them. “We’ve been getting a lot of mixed information. The president has put out different information, then OMB puts out guidance, and then the DOT secretary puts out guidance and then the FAA administrator puts out guidance,” said Mike Perrone, national president of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, AFL-CIO, a union that sounded the alarm on the FAA’s lack of transparency with the Las Vegas worker who was diagnosed with the virus. “Nobody said nothing for how many hours? And they knew about it?” Perrone added. “I’m frustrated — very frustrated — because literally people are gonna get sick and people could potentially die or spread it to their families.”  There are no clear directions for reporting disclosures of coronavirus throughout the federal government, leaving each individual agency to determine how to share information about known cases — who gets to know, how soon they should be informed and how often they require updates. The spectrum ranges from severe undersharing to daily reports. A spokesperson for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission told POLITICO the agency provides updates to staff each day, including when leadership was alerted to an employee who exhibited symptoms of the coronavirus at its headquarters. “Staff were alerted over the weekend through email, the agency’s alert system and a posting to the EEOC website,” said Kimberly Smith-Brown, an EEOC spokeswoman.  Voice of America reported its first case to employees on Thursday roughly an hour after the agency itself was notified, following through on its commitment to “give you information as soon as possible.” VOA Director Amanda Bennett pledged to “keep you informed if further cases are diagnosed in the coming weeks.” As anxiety mounts among their staff, agencies have been encouraged to “maximize” teleworking in recent days, in line with recent guidance from the Office of Personnel Management. That guidance, however, is a recommendation — not a rule. It encourages employees to refer to their specific agencies “for communications and guidance on telework or leave status.” But some agencies have gone a step further. The Department of Transportation, after confirming its first case on Thursday morning, told employees via email that “effective immediately and until further notice, we are mandating that all employees not report to duty at the DOT headquarters unless specifically notified by your manager.” Similarly, the Commerce Department mandated that all employees in the Herbert C. Hoover building begin teleworking until Monday after informing employees of its first case Wednesday night. And the Department of Agriculture told employees who worked in close proximity to an employee who tested positive Sunday that they should begin teleworking immediately. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette emailed staff Wednesday about a DOE employee at its Forrestal headquarters building who was diagnosed with coronavirus. The Education Department hasn’t had any cases, but a spokesperson said the department would “send a note to employees in the affected area” if one were diagnosed with the virus. The Department of Health and Human Services has asked all of its operating and staff divisions in the National Capital Region to “leverage maximum telework flexibilities,” a spokesperson said Thursday. Two HHS agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, confirmed their first case this week. The Food and Drug Administration has “a few” confirmed cases, according to FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo, who said she wasn’t able to share a more specific number. On Friday evening, Vice President Mike Pence’s office announced that a staffer had tested positive, though a spokeswoman said that neither Pence nor President Donald Trump had had close contact with the person. Pence has not been tested for the virus, and his office said there were no plans to do so at this time. Citing the growing number of reports of federal employees who have continued to go to work and contract the virus, Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called on Trump to do more.  “This is an urgent situation,” Van Hollen said in a clip posted to Twitter on Thursday. “Mr. President, you’ve got to issue an executive order to all agencies to maximize telework, and do it now.” Administration officials counter that guidance, rather than executive orders, are the nimblest approach to the evolving threat of the virus and that agency leaders should ultimately determine what’s best for them and their employees.  Drafting an executive order is a time-consuming process that may not be able to keep up with the pace of the outbreak, they note, and sending all government employees home could harm Americans: food shortages due to lack of inspections, for instance, and no air traffic controllers to direct aircraft. “By acting early and decisively, President Trump has ensured the government continues to be open and essential services are provided to the American public, including our most vulnerable,” an Office of Management and Budget spokesperson said in a statement. “Now is not the time to be distracted by those who use business-as-usual Washington tactics to distract from the urgent measures which all Americans are taking to respond in this emergency.” The White House issued guidelines this week recommending Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people and work from home as much as possible. To slow the spread of the virus, it also encouraged sick Americans, older people and those with underlying conditions to stay home. Inside the White House itself, staffers have started conducting temperature checks of anyone who may come in close contact with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, including reporters and anyone going in and out of the Oval Office. They also have reduced the number of reporters sitting in the rows of chairs in the briefing room, requiring an open seat between every reporter. Outgoing chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows both self-quarantined, and press secretary Stephanie Grisham has been working from home. Trump tested negative for the virus, as did his daughter Ivanka, and Pence has told reporters that he hasn’t been tested. Some agencies, like the State Department, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, have unique considerations that make mitigating the spread of the virus especially challenging.  State has more than 75,000 employees, with more than 9,000 Foreign Service and Civil Service officers scattered overseas. DHS employs more than 240,000 workers, many of whom interact with people daily for work, such as employees with Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration. And the Department of Defense has roughly 26,000 employees inside its Pentagon headquarters in Virginia, but employs nearly 3 million service members and civilians worldwide, with a presence in more than 160 countries and nearly 5,000 defense sites. There is growing frustration inside the State Department about the limited internal communications on the impact of the virus on its workforce. The department’s employees are flung across the world, including in many countries with poor health infrastructure. But even U.S. diplomats and other staffers based in Washington are worried about their exposure. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters Tuesday that only a “handful” of employees have tested positive. “You can count ‘em on one hand,” Pompeo said.  A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, said there are around 50 suspected coronavirus cases of people affiliated with the State Department worldwide, including some two dozen in the U.S. Several cases have been confirmed positive, the official said.  At least one State Department employee working in Washington has also tested positive, according to a notice from the Bureau of Consular Affairs obtained by POLITICO. Overall, the information available on State Department cases has come through patchwork messaging involving various embassies, bureaus and other divisions with no centralized, regular updates about the department as a whole. The department has suspended routine visa services in most countries due to the outbreak, a State Department spokesperson said, a move that limits the exposure of diplomats to potential carriers. But there’s no uniform guidance across embassies on when, for instance, staffers should cancel meetings or what other social distancing measures they should take, a State Department staffer monitoring the situation said, adding to confusion in the ranks. On Thursday, the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed its first known case of an employee contracting the virus. The employee is affiliated with a USAID mission in sub-Saharan Africa, according to agency administrator Mark Green.  In an email to USAID employees, Green, who is leaving his post soon, promised that the agency “will continue to provide you with timely updates that include all available information and relevant guidance.” Nearly 500 DHS employees were quarantined as of Wednesday, and at least 13 were either confirmed of having coronavirus or presumed positive, according to documentation reviewed by POLITICO. A DHS spokesperson, however, wouldn’t comment on the documentation on the record.  At the Pentagon, officials are relying on individual offices to assess themselves and their colleagues for any signs of the virus. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday morning that 67 service members have tested positive, though the Pentagon later reported its first two cases inside the building, according to the Air Force. DOD has issued guidance encouraging employees to stay home if they or someone they work with show symptoms. “This really starts with the individual, and I think it is not about policy at this point,” said Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Chiefs surgeon, who personally sent home two staffers who may have been sick. “It’s about a shared commitment to minimize the impact of this outbreak, and each of us individually has a responsibility.”  Nahal Toosi, Lara Seligman, Myah Ward, Daniel Lippman, Sarah Owermohle, Betsy Woodruff Swan, Rebecca Rainey, Liz Crampton, Nicole Gaudiano, Eric Wolff, Brianna Gurciullo, Tanya Snyder and Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",Trump administration confronts a growing coronavirus threat within,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-government-agencies-transparency-138711,politico
"The nation’s health care system and its economy are already reeling from the effects of the still spreading coronavirus. But the pandemic has had a profound, though less noted, impact on our legal system as well. I practice in courts across the country, and over the past week my inbox has been full of orders and notices from courts regarding changes in their practices due to the coronavirus. These orders give us a peek into how courts across the country are scrambling to ensure that justice is served and constitutional rights are protected while they make serious accommodations in the face of this public health threat. While these measures are a necessary response to a global crisis, if any of them stick after the threat has abated, they could permanently alter the legal system—and not necessarily for the better. Even temporary changes have a big impact. For example, federal and state courts around the country have rapidly issued orders that delay thousands of cases en masse. For example, the federal court in Manhattan postponed all civil and criminal jury trials scheduled to begin before April 27, and Chicago’s federal court extended all deadlines in civil cases by 21 days and struck all hearings and trials in civil cases through April 3. New York state courts have postponed all trials “until further notice.” While significant attention has been focused on the Supreme Court’s delay in oral arguments regarding President Donald Trump’s effort to shield his tax returns from New York prosecutors, which makes it even more likely that this issue will not be resolved until after the presidential election, a more immediate impact will be felt by the thousands of people who have filed civil suits and are waiting for the legal system to compensate them for their losses or injuries. Social distancing runs counter to the way our legal system works. The jury selection process requires dozens of people to congregate for hours in a room. Motions are argued in person by lawyers who sit in an often packed courtroom waiting for their case to be called. Depositions involve a witness, court reporter and multiple lawyers seated together for hours around a conference table. The criminal justice process involves even more in-person interaction. Law enforcement officers interact closely and personally with defendants, and criminal cases often involve defendants who are incarcerated and must be brought to the courtroom so they are physically present for proceedings. Charging a defendant with a felony involves convening a grand jury, which requires a dozen grand jurors to assemble in a small room with a prosecutor and witnesses. The constitutional requirement that felony cases must be charged by grand jury will greatly reduce criminal charges. For example, the federal court in San Francisco recently suspended all grand jury proceedings until May 1. Arrests can be made prior to that time, but the defendant’s rights to a speedy trial and to be charged by indictment would need to be put on hold until a grand jury is convened. And who knows whether that May 1 deadline might have to be extended? Given the risk of community spread imposed by arrest and incarceration, you can expect law enforcement to arrest fewer people in the weeks ahead, particularly for minor offenses. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez recently announced that his office “will immediately decline to prosecute low-level offenses that don’t jeopardize public safety.” His office also asked defense counsel to alert them to defendants who “are vulnerable to infection” and should be considered for release. More recently, Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pushed for the release of low-risk federal prisoners after inmates in a California jail tested positive. But the criminal justice system can’t shut down completely, even during a pandemic in which the number of diagnosed cases is rising exponentially. Serious offenses cannot be ignored by police, so courts are turning to technology and changing their procedures in order to preserve defendants’ constitutional rights. For example, New Jersey state courts are conducting all hearings with incarcerated defendants as “video hearings, phone hearings, or will be adjourned as necessary.” Federal judges in Chicago are encouraged to review search warrant and wiretap requests via “reliable electronic means” rather than in person. Given the global pandemic we face, these accommodations may be necessary in the short term, although the specter of defendants pleading guilty after a brief video conversation with a lawyer they have never met calls into question the constitutional adequacy of procedures in some jurisdictions. In any event, everyone understands that accommodations must to be made in the short term in the face of a global crisis. But significant short-term changes can result in long-term shifts. A central feature of our criminal justice system is that defendants are physically present at all critical proceedings, which ensures that prosecutors and judges see the defendant in person while they make decisions about that person’s life, and enables the defendant to consult with his or her attorney in real time. The personal, face-to-face nature of our criminal justice system gives it humanity that a highly automated procedure would lack.  A streamlined process for investigating and prosecuting crimes can make law enforcement much more efficient. On its face, that may sound like a good thing, and it very well might be. But current penalties and legal standards are based upon a system that punishes only a fraction of people who commit crimes that can be difficult to detect and prosecute. If prosecutions are streamlined and our legal standards don’t change, incarceration could increase despite a widespread bipartisan consensus that criminal justice reform is needed. Our legal system needs to evolve in the short term to respond to the coronavirus, and it is doing so. Recent positive tests by U.S. Marshals and courthouse employees drive home how necessary that evolution is right now. But once this crisis passes, we need to be mindful before using this experience to make permanent changes to our system. The humanity and face-to-face nature of our legal system is important and can't be replicated by a video screen.","Stuck in an Overwhelmed Legal System: Civil Suits, Criminal Defendants and Trump’s Tax Returns",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/20/stuck-in-an-overwhelmed-legal-system-civil-lawsuits-criminal-defendants-and-trumps-tax-returns-139579,politico
"The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday held its first teleconference arguments of the coronavirus era, mounting a remote set-up that proved a shaky but adequate substitute for the usual in-person repartee between judges and lawyers. With the courthouse near Capitol Hill largely shuttered due to concerns about the virus, a three-judge panel of the powerful D.C. appeals court heard nearly two hours of arguments in two cases: a challenge to the Trump administration’s expansion of Obamacare exemptions for short-term health insurance policies and a labor fight involving a union representing National Weather Service employees. At least one judge, Thomas Griffith, seemed to regard the arrangements — with judges and lawyers joining remotely by phone — as less than a swimming success. Griffith is typically an active questioner and was the first out of the gate to challenge Charles Rothfeld, the attorney representing groups opposing the administration’s effort to expand the use of less-regulated, short-term insurance policies. But after some spirited jousting with Rothfeld, Griffith fell silent — involuntarily, it turned out. “I was dropped from the call for about five or six minutes and I want to make clear that I’m back on it now,” said Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee. “I tried to get in and I was on a permanent mute. And, I don’t know, I’m not on the screen anymore. By the phone, it’s kind of a mess.” At the outset of the arguments — which the public and press could hear live via a YouTube link — a court clerk announced the lawyers wouldn’t have anything like the courtroom’s green, yellow and red timing lights that help pace arguments. Instead, a bell replaced those signals.  And that wasn’t the only extraneous sound on the call — there were random beeps, muddled voices, overtalking and some long pauses. One of those pauses involved an effort by Judge Judith Rogers to question Justice Department attorney Daniel Winik, who was defending the health-insurance policy changes. Rogers launched into a question about Congress’ intent, but she trailed off, becoming inaudible. “You’re honor, I apologize. I’m actually not able to hear your question. It tailed off,” Winik said. “I was able to hear the very beginning of the question and lost you about 10 seconds in. I’m sorry with the difficulties of this format.” After some more noises on the line, Winik added: “Your honor, I’m not hearing anything.” “Hello? And….?” Rogers replied. The arguments in that case eventually got back on track. The later one, involving the Weather Service forecasters, went more smoothly. However, there were still awkward pauses and some indistinct sounds. “Am I still on? I’m getting some weird noises,” Federal Labor Relations Authority Solicitor Noah Peters asked at one point. “You’re still on,” a couple of the judges reassured him. Peters told POLITICO after the session that it was a bit strange to be arguing into a phone at his Arlington, Va., home rather than from a courtroom lectern. However, he said his office also held a “virtual” moot court session in recent days rather than in person, an adjustment required by the federal government’s virus-related directive for employees to telework wherever possible. “The only thing I had trouble adjusting to [was] when the questions stopped at one point and I was wondering if I had logged off. I had to blurt out, ‘Hello?’ to see if the line had gone dead,” Peters said. “It can be tough to know when somebody is starting to speak and stopping. For the judges, there was a little overtalking of one another, which you don’t normally see at a live, in-person argument.” Rothfeld, the attorney in the insurance case, said in an interview that the arrangement is “not ideal,” but noted some advantages to arguing over the phone. One is you can spread out your papers and notes as you see fit. Also: courtroom attire isn’t required. Even shoes are optional. “It’s better in that you can set yourself up. You can even argue in your socks, if you want, which I never get to do at the D.C. Circuit,” he said. Asked if he had actually argued shoeless, Rothfeld said: “I probably shouldn’t have owned up to it, but yes.” While arguments by conference call are uncommon in most federal courts, they’re not unheard of. An argument at the 9th Circuit in 2017 on blocking President Donald Trump’s travel ban took place by phone with the audio streamed live on cable TV and YouTube. It was something of a sensation, drawing millions of viewers on TV and the web. Some appeals courts also use video conferencing or a speakerphone to beam in judges who can’t be at a particular session. The Supreme Court —which bars cameras and only rarely allows live audio — has not yet followed the trend of other courts to harness new technology for its public work in the rejiggered coronavirus age. The high court has postponed arguments that were set to take place in about a dozen cases next week and the week after, including a trio of cases about access to Trump’s financial records. Although arguments before three-judge panels at the D.C. Circuit are going forward for now by phone, that court appears reluctant to use that format for the larger, en banc sessions held in exceptional cases. On Tuesday, the court postponed an 11-judge argument that was set to take place next week about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s power to delay action in cases it is considering. An order said that session is being put off until April 28, when most of the court’s judges are scheduled to be together for arguments in two much higher-profile disputes: a fight over the House’s effort to force testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, and a separate battle over a House-filed lawsuit challenging Trump’s plan to re-allocate billions of dollars in funds for border wall construction. While those three cases are now set for argument that day, the court has also warned that changes are possible to the timing and format of arguments depending on how the pandemic progresses. Some parties are seeking to delay arguments so they can take place in the more traditional in-person fashion, but the court seems keen to keep to its current schedule where possible. Last week, an attorney representing Playboy’s White House reporter, Brian Karem, in a credentialing dispute with the White House joined with a Justice Department lawyer to ask that arguments the D.C. Circuit had set for Monday be put off until May. The motion was rejected, without explanation, meaning arguments will continue as scheduled on Monday — apparently by telephone. Based on the way things played out Friday, lawyers involved said they don’t expect the judges to opt for phone arguments as a matter of routine anytime soon. “It is better than postponing the argument. It is better than canceling the argument,” said Peters, the Federal Labor Relations Authority attorney. “I don’t think, obviously, that it will become a feature of the landscape, but in all honestly I think it went well — as an experiment.”",‘Kind of a mess’: D.C.

"Joe Biden is planning a regular shadow briefing on coronavirus to start as early as Monday to show how he would handle the crisis and address what he calls the lies and failures of President Trump. Biden gave a preview of what’s to come in a conference call with reporters Friday, where he listed a litany of false and misleading statements from Trump, who has been holding regular White House press conferences concerning coronavirus preparedness and response that have been broadcast live on all major networks. “President Trump stop saying false things, will ya?” Biden said. “People are worried they are really frightened, when these things don't come through. He just exacerbates their concern. Stop saying false things you think make you sound like a hero and start putting the full weight of the federal government behind finding fast, safe and effective treatments.” Biden made his comments from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he has been holed up for more than a week in adherence with Centers for Disease Control guidelines that urge people to practice social distancing.  Immediately after the initial onset of the crisis, Biden also held his fire against the president out of concern it would look too political — an accusation leveled at him anyway by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, who said that “Biden will take attention from real updates Americans should know just to score political points.” Ever since his commanding victories Tuesday against Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, Biden has made no public appearances or statements. Instead, he said, he has been spending time privately talking to health officials, businesses, governors and members of Congress. Now, he said, his house is being outfitted with equipment that would enable him to livestream events, have interactive tele-press conferences and broadcast interviews with network television. “I would like to get in the position and we're trying to work out so that the headquarters ... to be able to accommodate my directly answering questions in front of a press that's assigned to me,” he said. “We've hired a professional team to do that now. And excuse the expression that's a little above my pay grade to know how to do that.” Most of Biden’s time was spent lighting up Trump.  Biden pointed out that the president said the U.S. is “very close” to making a coronavirus vaccine, but that could be a year away (and Trump confused the coronavirus with Ebola). Biden noted that Trump said two Navy ships are in “tip top shape” and on the way to help, but the Navy said one is in maintenance and the other lacks a medical crew and is being “spruced up,” according to NBC News. The 500 million respirator masks that Trump said the government ordered, Biden noted, could take 18 months to arrive. And he faulted Trump for doing too little to support state and local governments. Biden also twice pointed out that Trump on March 6 said anybody who wants a coronavirus test can get it. But there aren’t enough tests. “I’m sorry to say, that was simply a lie. And it’s still not true today,” Biden said. “The United States has been far behind the rest of the advanced world when it comes to testing.”",Biden plans shadow coronavirus briefings,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/biden-coronavirus-plannings-139629,politico
"CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced plans Friday he will direct the state’s 13 million residents stay home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, a move coming less than 24 hours after California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a similar edict. Effective 5 p.m. Saturday local time all Illinois residents in Illinois will be allowed to go to grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors’ appointments and to get gas for their cars but will otherwise be subject to a “stay at home order” through April 7. “I did not come to this decision lightly,” Pritzker told reporters during a daily briefing about the disease, announcing his decision.  Illinois reported its 5th death due to the illness on Friday. State Public Health chief Ngozi Ezike said there are 585 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across 25 counties. Non-essential businesses must shut down, Pritzker said, but the “fundamental building blocks” of society will not change. Similar to New York and Ohio, which have also shuttered a range of businesses to fight COVID-19, restaurants are barred from offering dine-in service but take-out and drive-through will continue.  ""We know this will be hard,"" Pritzker said. ""This will not last forever. But it will force us to change. We in Illinois have overcome obstacles before and we will again.” Pritzker’s new plan goes well beyond what Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot told city residents in a Thursday afternoon address from her ceremonial office in City Hall, mostly urging those who feel sick to stay home. By Friday afternoon, Lightfoot made the leap alongside the governor. “This is a make break or break moment for the city and the state,” Lightfoot said during Friday’s briefing. ""Now is not the time for half measures… We need to act swiftly. We have seen what happens when we don’t mobilize,” she said, pointing to other countries that have been hit hard by the virus. “We must be intentional about flattening the curve.”Essential employees will still be able to report to work, such as supply chain crews who keep grocery stores stocked and running. First responders, manufacturing workers, journalists and food delivery workers will also be able to continue. The rest of residents must stay home except for essential needs, the governor said.  Residents may still walk outside — including at Chicago parks, though the park facilities will be closed. Libraries will also close. Pritzker said child care services will be provided to first-responders and that evictions of those who are affected by the spiraling economy will be halted.  “I asked what action can I take to save the most lives…to avoid the loss of tens of thousands of lives,” Pritzker said of his conversations with scientists, mathematicians and health officials who monitor the virus. Illinois officials are focusing on increasing testing and hospital capacity. The state is working to reopen closed hospital. Officials are determining what it will take to open the hospitals and provide medical care to patients with COVID-19. There also are discussions about starting tele-health for people who have mild symptoms.",‘We know this will be hard’: Pritzker orders Illinois residents to hunker down amid coronavirus ,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/illinois-pritzker-coronavirus-139601,politico
"On Thursday, the president said during his White House coronavirus briefing that “nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we’d need tens of thousands of ventilators.” But this need has long been recognized. Those in the pandemic and hospital preparedness community, including us, have warned for years about the likelihood of a mismatch in demand and ability to care for critically ill people, should a pandemic the likes of the 1918 Spanish Flu take place again. Now that very situation is upon us, and it’s abundantly clear that the United States government needs to step in immediately. We are facing an impact from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, that is unlike anything we have seen in modern times. For the battle against it, the U.S. needs a wartime mobilization to make mass numbers of ventilators, and to ensure the oxygen supply will be sufficient around the country for all the patients who will need it. The federal government needs to do something far more ambitious than sounding the alarm or coordinating with manufacturers: It needs to become the primary buyer and central market of ventilators. And doing so is both within its stated reach and part of its duty. With the authority of the Defense Production Act, the U.S. government should approach, if it has not already done so, all ventilator manufacturers in the country and enter into very clear and binding contracts that commit the federal government to pay companies to move to maximum production for the indefinite future. The Defense Logistics Agency, with its massive capabilities and experience, could play a role in coordinating such an ambitious operation. The principal reason people die after coronavirus infection is that they get overwhelming pneumonia and their lungs fail. While a ventilator can’t save all people with respiratory failure, it could be the critical difference between life and death for many patients. The problem is, unless we “flatten the curve,” there are, and will continue to be, far more Americans who need ventilators than the number of ventilators in America. Recently completed research shows that in Wuhan, at its peak, there were more than 2,000 COVID-19 patients requiring critical care at the same time. For countries experiencing Wuhan-like outbreaks at once across many cities, including the United States, ventilator demand could be extraordinarily high and outstrip supply so that some people needing ventilators would not be able get them. We have seen this happen in Northern Italy, resulting in very high death rates. According to the New York Times, per estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, while the country has less than 1 million staffed hospital beds. In order to try to avert such a catastrophic failure of the health care system, governors are implementing unprecedented efforts to slow transmission of the virus in order to reduce the number of people in need of critical care all at the same time. And the recent guidelines issued by the White House for what individuals should do to slow the rate of spread of the virus were clear and appropriate. But policy expressed at the White House regarding ventilators is not nearly sufficient. The president advised governors on Monday that they should try to get essential equipment and supplies, including ventilators, on their own. The problem with that approach is that suppliers will have to simultaneously engage with 50 different states and countless hospitals that would in effect be competing for supply. Instead, the federal government should be the central buyer and partner with industry. It would bring immediate and substantial resources and clarity. And when manufacturers make new ventilators in a mass effort, the federal government could help organize their distribution around the country so as to do the most good. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump invoked the DPA, which enables the U.S. government to direct private industry to prioritize manufacture of needed equipment including ventilators. But it appears that, as of Thursday, Trump had not ordered the manufacture or purchase of ventilators. He also reiterated on Thursday that he did not view the mass purchase of ventilators to be an appropriate federal function. (The White House has been unclear as to whether this changed on Friday.) We disagree in the strongest terms. Beyond existing manufacturers, the federal government should be asking other U.S. industrial giants (outside the ventilator industry) to turn their production lines to making ventilators, as the United Kingdom did this week. The UK is asking Ford, Rolls-Royce and Honda to make ventilators. If the U.S. federal government were willing to pay for the effort, perhaps some American industries, like the auto manufacturers that have already offered, would find a way to contribute. A recent Forbes article gives a snapshot of the ventilator industry and a sense of what might be possible: One U.S. manufacturer says he could ramp up production five-fold, but he hadn’t been asked to do so yet. It also reports that Germany has ordered 10,000 ventilators. On a ventilator per capita level, the U.S. would need to buy 40,000 ventilators to match that kind of investment. In a Wall Street Journal article, some giant ventilator manufactures have said they are ramping up production, but it is not clear to what extent. No one can say with certainty how many more ventilators we need—much depends on how effective our social distancing efforts are. But middle of the road estimates indicate that we will easily need a further 50,000. At an average cost of approximately $20,000 (though they can range from $12,000 to $50,000 each) we are talking on the order of $1 billion. The U.S. has and is willing to spend huge sums of money on coronavirus response efforts. This one is paramount. Some will say that enough ventilators simply cannot be made in time to be useful to all of those who need them right now and in the coming weeks. Sadly, that may well be true, but this pandemic and the need for more ventilators will be with us for a long time. If we turn massive industrial attention and resources to making ventilators, we will be better prepared for the long run through this pandemic. A surplus of ventilators—a far-off possibility at the moment—would not be a bad thing. Beyond the U.S., all countries need ventilators to deal with this pandemic. If the U.S. can create a process for massive industrial capacity and output, we should aim to produce ventilators for other countries in the world that will also desperately need them. And stockpiling ventilators in the future could prevent having to scramble to supply them should another catastrophe strike.",It’s Time to Build Ventilators Like We’re at War and Our Lives Depend on It,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/20/ventilators-wartime-mobilization-139581,politico
"The VA should be perfectly positioned to treat patients from afar, keeping both veterans and department employees away from possible exposure to the coronavirus. But in these early days of the pandemic response, many in the department say it's not working out. VA employees are finding it difficult to use the department’s network. Essential services are being disrupted in some locations: In Las Vegas, a number of employees have been called back into the office, despite the risks of spreading the virus, after the surge in remote work strained the network. Uploads of radiological images are taking an hour. “The impact for that is huge because if a radiologist can’t see the film, they can’t treat the patient in an emergent/critical period,” said Linda Ward-Smith, the union president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Las Vegas local, in an email. The issues are critical for an agency that both cares for a large, medically complex population — veterans — and is also expected to serve as the backup for the health care system writ large — the VA's so-called fourth mission. Making sure hospital beds are available by treating less urgent patients from afar is essential to preventing the health system from becoming overwhelmed. The department has long touted its telehealth capabilities; in November, it announced that 900,000 veterans used its telehealth services in fiscal year 2019, a 17 percent increase over the year before. In a Thursday interview with POLITICO, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie called telehealth “the wave of the future,” particularly for mental health care, and said the department would be “increasing exponentially our capabilities in that field.” It’s unclear precisely how widespread the problems are as the pandemic grows. Multiple unions representing VA employees have reported issues, and some workers have contacted congressional offices as well. VA employees use the internet for telehealth services, treating patients by video and sharing images and other health information. They also serve an important administrative service: processing veterans’ claims to use care outside the VA system. In the POLITICO interview, Wilkie attributed some of the reported problems to a stress test of the system: The department, he said, had taken out some of its “lines of bandwidth” to see how it would do with a more limited network. Employees who were using the affected lines “went down for a few minutes,” Wilkie said, adding, “but that was just part of a nationwide test on the system.” He added that the department so far has “experienced no hiccups when it comes to getting benefits out.” Ideally, the department would be expanding its telehealth services in response to the pandemic, as seeing a patient by video, or monitoring vital signs remotely, can save labor. Telehealth would help the department in “minimizing exposure to patients who they don’t want to expose … and freeing up their assets to deal with expected workload,” said Kenneth Kizer, a former undersecretary for health in the VA during the Clinton administration. Beefing up the department’s internet infrastructure is a key task in the months ahead. The department this week requested $1.2 billion in supplemental funding to add bandwidth supporting more telehealth visits and telework capabilities. One House staffer said the department doesn’t know how many employees are currently teleworking, though it estimates 75,000. The department thinks it can support approximately double that, if not slightly more, and is hoping to eventually support 300,000 employees of its nearly 400,000-strong workforce working remotely. The VA didn't respond to requests for comment regarding the estimates provided by the staffer. Jon Bloom, a co-founder of Podimetrics, a telehealth startup using wireless mats to predict the onset of diabetic foot ulcers based on limb temperature, says the department is “way out ahead of anyone I’m aware of in terms of mobilizing telehealth.” Podimetrics, which has worked closely with the department on treating diabetic patients, could allow doctors to address their concerns without bringing them into the hospital — and exposing a high-risk population to the coronavirus. And Bloom said he’s been talking with VA officials to deploy telehealth further. Still, there are operational hiccups. Multiple employees and union groups are reporting turbulence. “[T]o have tons of providers switching to using an entirely new modality all at once has been chaotic,” said one clinician who requested anonymity to speak freely. “It is overwhelming the system, and the few people who actually know how it all works and can answer people's questions.” The clinician said the VA’s telehealth software is confusing and may slow things down, especially for older providers and patients who lack smartphones and Wi-Fi. And employees’ desire to work from afar might outweigh the department’s capabilities. In Las Vegas, AFGE’s Ward-Smith said the chief of mental health had asked to deliver all visits over video — only to be stymied by issues in the department’s video connect app. Many employees, such as those who process claims, would like to work from home to minimize their coronavirus risks, but can’t due to network issues. “People are afraid,” Ward-Smith said. It’s not just AFGE reporting problems. “There have been major delays with employees accessing the network, and some have even been kicked off,” said Lee Blackmon, director of the National Association of Government Employees’ federal division. “I was also informed that the VA is considering staggering employees' telework schedules to decrease the number of employees trying to access the network simultaneously.” Reports of problems have reached the congressional level, with multiple staffers confirming they’d heard issues about slow networks interfering with work. Congress has been trying to check in on the department’s response generally, asking Wilkie for updates on the number of coronavirus tests processed per day. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee raised the IT issue in a letter to Wilkie last Wednesday.

"President Donald Trump called himself a ""big fan"" of an unproven coronavirus treatment Friday and repeatedly contradicted his own top health officials on how much is known about the drug's potential to help at least some patients affected by the pandemic. “It is very effective. It is a strong drug,” Trump declared at a long, sprawling televised briefing, referring to a malaria drug that is in the early stages of being tested against Covid-19. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and other White House task force members appeared visibly uncomfortable as Trump repeatedly hailed the drug's promise. A day earlier, a similar scenario unfolded in the White House briefing room as FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn tried to tamp down Trump's confidence and explained the many steps that scientists have to go through before they know a treatment is safe and effective for a particular condition. ""We want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered,"" Hahn said of chloroquine's effectiveness. Chloroquine is one of several medications — some already on the market for other diseases, some still in the clinical pipeline — that are being tested to see if they can treat the novel virus, to make it less severe. Scientists in several countries around the world, some part of a multinational WHO effort, are undertaking studies of whether the drug, used for malaria and arthritis, can help save lives from this disease. But the existing research Trump was so enthused about is very preliminary, as Fauci painstakingly explained several times on Friday. Basically, the science done to date shows that it's worth investigating further — but it doesn't prove much on its own about its effect on Covid-19. The United States is obtaining ""millions"" of doses for further study and for ""compassionate use"" — letting doctors try the unproven drug on very sick people. Scientists can collect data if a drug is given under compassionate use rules — though not as fully as in a clinical trial. While the malaria drug has a fairly good safety profile; no medication is without some risks. And it's completely unknown whether it's safe for people who are dangerously ill with coronavirus. Researchers don't yet know when to administer it, or at what doses. It may work best right after someone is infected, or could be most effective only if someone is already critically ill. Barry Bloom of Harvard School Public Health told reporters earlier this week that preliminary research shows chloroquine might have the greatest effect ""at earliest stage of disease"" — currently a challenge when the U.S. is only testing people who already have severe symptoms. ""Something that prevents people from being severely ill is wonderful, but unlikely to affect the epidemic unless it could be used very early on,” he warned. In the best case scenario, it will take months to know whether, as Fauci said Friday, it's “truly safe and truly effective” with this disease. That didn't stop the president. “Right now, in terms of malaria, if you wanted, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. And by the way, it's very effective. It works,” he told reporters. Fauci, who has had to strike a delicate balance between providing accurate information and avoiding contradicting his boss, cut back in. “You have to be careful when you say ‘fairly effective,’” he pleaded. “It was never done in a clinical trial.” The tense back-and-forth in the White House briefing room echoed the FDA's Hahn's similar attempts earlier this week to downplay the president's optimistic claims of readily available drugs to treat the new virus. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" Hahn said. “We need to make sure the sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patients, at the right dosage, at the right time."" Sarah Owermohle contributed to this report.",Trump hypes unproven coronavirus drugs as top science officials manage expectations,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-hypes-unproven-coronavirus-drugs-139525,politico
"President Donald Trump on Friday shot down the prospect for any kind of nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, resisting a step that California, New York and now Illinois have already taken. “I don't think so,” Trump told reporters Friday when asked whether California‘s strategy could be adopted nationwide.  Trump, who instead announced another series of mitigation efforts spanning the federal government, maintained that California and New York were exceptions. “Essentially you've done that in California. You've done that in New York. Those are two hotbeds,” he said. But, he added, “you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they're watching it on television, but they don't have the same problems. They don't have by any means the same problem.” While the president said he would continue to work with governors, “I don't think we'll ever find that necessary,” he said of a nationwide lockdown. Even as his administration has ramped up its coronavirus response, Trump has appeared hesitant at times to take steps that would further kneecap a U.S. economy that is already in an unprecedented free fall. Even without a nationwide lockdown, millions of Americans have already essentially self-quarantined, posing a mortal danger to the service and hospitality industries and threatening to thrust the entire U.S. economy into a recession. The dramatic economic slowdown has prompted talks between the White House and Congress not just on a massive bailout package for suffering industries but also of plans to cut checks to individual Americans. Taken together, costs for the government's economic response are expected to soar past $1 trillion. What Trump did announce was that he had finally put the Defense Production Act, which would allow him to order private corporations to manufacture desperately supplies, “into high gear,” days after saying he would not yet trigger the Korean War-era statute. But aside from name-checking General Motors, the president declined to say what companies he had ordered into action and how many items he had ordered. He also announced the partial closure of the U.S.-Mexico border to nonessential travel, a move that mirrors the closure of the northern border with Canada earlier this week. Trump rolled out a number of new measures aimed at providing relief to American consumers as well, saying the Education Department would allow federal student loan borrowers to suspend payments for at least 60 days and that the IRS is pushing back its deadline to file taxes by three months. The president and his coronavirus task force were repeatedly questioned throughout the nearly 90-minute briefing on everything from their failures to produce widespread access to test kits for the respiratory illness to health care workers' unmet pleas for personal protective equipment or treatment machines like ventilators.  But a day after saying that it was states’ responsibility to procure supplies, and that the federal government was not a “shipping clerk,"" Trump signaled a move to nationalize the supply chain and improve the allocation of resources for health care providers. He announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would take over emergency response, asking governors to coordinate with their regional FEMA administrators.  Experts had urged such an approach because the federal government has powers to boost production that states do not and a federal approach can allocate scarce goods to the places that need them most, not just the state that calls up manufacturers fastest. Trump alluded to that dynamic on Friday. “We need certain equipment that the states are unable to get by themselves,” he said. “So we're invoking [the Defense Production Act] to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need, like the masks, like the ventilators.”  Still, the new approach appeared to be uneven. Asked about concerns raised by Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, a day earlier that the federal government was outbidding states for critical supplies, Trump acknowledged such occurrences but contended that ""smart"" states call and tell the government to withdraw its bid. Trump insisted that there were “millions” of supplies, including masks and ventilators, heading to states. And while he did not offer many details on that front, manufacturing giant 3M announced during the briefing that it has doubled its global output of coveted N95 respirator masks since the outbreak began, increasing its output “to an annual rate of over 1.1 billion per year, or nearly 100 million per month.” But the president also wrongly suggested entities like shuttered car factories could be retrofitted instantaneously to accommodate the need for supplies, a reconfiguration that in reality could take almost a year.  “We're getting calls from automobile companies. We're getting calls from other companies saying they have plant capacity,” Trump said. “They want to make ventilators, they want to make other things. We are literally being besieged, in a beautiful way, by companies that want to do the work.”  The task force also continued to defend its coronavirus testing lags, and despite Trump’s top expert on infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, conceding earlier Friday that “clearly, more needs to be done” to expand the availability of testing kits, Trump denied that access to kits was an issue. “We’re hearing positive things about testing,” Trump asserted to reporters, despite anecdotes all over from those who say they are exhibiting symptoms of the disease and still cannot get tested. When pressed on the issue, Trump shot back with a dig at the reporter personally and telling her, “Yeah, well, OK, I’m not hearing it.” But even Fauci stepped up to the lectern to acknowledge that there were still flaws in the process, telling reporters that “we are not there yet” in terms of meeting the demand for tests.  “I get the same calls that many of you get. Someone goes into a place who has a symptom and wants to get tested for one reason or another and they can't get it,” he said. “That is the reality that's happening now.” But Fauci pointed to improvements that had been made in getting people tested. “Is it the same as a few weeks ago?” he said. “Absolutely not.” The exchange appeared to irritate the president, who then returned to repeat previous attacks on his predecessor, deflecting blame for the recent stumbles and criticizing what he claimed was a “broken system” he’d inherited. “We have, now, a great system. And it’s almost fully in gear but it is able to test millions of people. We inherited a broken, old, frankly a terrible system. We fixed it and we’ve done a great job.” Trump complained. “We haven’t been given the credit that we deserve, that I can tell you.”  Despite Trump's suggestion that tests are being carried out smoothly, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that FEMA would stand up “a laboratory task force to answer” questions about a lack of supplies for tests, like cotton swabs.  “Usually it's the lab people do not understand there are actually alternative supplies in the marketplace, that they are perfectly free to use,” he said, saying that the government had just purchased 200,000 swabs on the open marketplace that they were sending to governors. “It's a complex system with 330 million Americans and all of these labs,” Azar explained. “So sometimes there's a lab that doesn't understand how much flexibility they have and how much supply there is out there. We're working through the new FEMA integration center to help correct that for folks.”",Trump on a nationwide lockdown: 'I don't think we'll ever find that necessary',2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-coronavirus-nationwide-lockdown-139330,politico
"Mike Bloomberg’s defunct presidential campaign laid off hundreds more staffers Friday as he announced that that he’s folding his massive battleground operation into the Democratic National Committee. Many of the Bloomberg aides — including those purged in an initial round of dismissals—were holding out hope he would deliver on a promise to keep them on his payroll through November, particularly with the coronavirus baring down. But those hopes were also dashed Friday when the staffers were told in frank conference calls that Bloomberg would not move ahead with his planned super PAC, and instead would cede his state operation to the DNC, including an $18 million infusion to help presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The staffers, who said they were lured to the late-starting campaign with yearlong guarantees of competitive pay and health benefit packages, were invited to apply for jobs with the DNC as part of a “competitive process.”  “I guess it’s cheaper to give the DNC $18 million than keep promises because @MikeBloomberg just fired his whole campaign staff — including those of us promised jobs though November on his IE,” Amol Jethwani, a former aide, wrote in a tweet. “Disappointed I don’t have a job. Not surprised that a billionaire is cheating scum.” Several other former aides said in interviews that the news comes as a massive blow amid the tanking economy. They believe the campaign has repeatedly strung them along while misrepresenting future opportunities. “I am disgusted by Mike Bloomberg and his staff,"" one of the Bloomberg aides, who like several others spoke on the condition of anonymity, told POLITICO on Friday. ""He has left us with no health insurance during this pandemic. I have a family and do not know what we will do at the end of the month.""  The person added, ""If the DNC and Joe Biden choose to ignore us, they are complicit as well. How can the party claim to care about working Americans while taking money from a billionaire that does not fulfill his promises to his employees?” POLITICO previously reported that Bloomberg was laying off hundreds of staffers around the country and paying them through March 31, though they would be allowed to keep their Bloomberg-issued iPhones and MacBooks (which would be taxed as income). But the campaign indicated at the time that those staffers would be given priority to apply for jobs in six battleground states that were to be funded by the planned super PAC. Those already working for him in the battleground states had planned to stay on his payroll to work on the nominee’s behalf. A planned internal staff conference call with those employees Wednesday was kicked over to Friday, when they, too, were told that Bloomberg was pulling out and they’d lose their jobs.  Pennsylvania State Director Kevin Kinross, on a separate call with his staff in the state Friday, called the edict “disappointing and (an) abrupt end to everything.” Kinross said he suspected that it was a small group decision. “To have people sort of twisting in the wind for all this time when you literally have the resources to make up the rules however you want them to be,” Mustafa Rashed, the communications director in the state, added on the call. “I feel bad for the people who moved their lives, their selves, their family to come to Pennsylvania or any other state to work and then to be uprooted during the midst of a global pandemic, I don’t know, it’s not good.” Several aides who asked to remain anonymous because of non-disclosure agreements they signed with Bloomberg said the perk of being paid all year was what motivated them to join the campaign in the first place. Some said they had yet to receive promised relocation expenses.  Others pointed to the millions Bloomberg is separately sinking into coronavirus response efforts as tone deaf at a time when aides who worked long hours in call centers on his behalf will have to foot their own costs. A Bloomberg spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the DNC Coordinated Campaign is hiring in the six battleground states. “And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to, including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible,” the spokesperson said.  Additionally, they said staff in the six battleground states that were let go Friday would be employed and paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April.  “This is the largest contribution from a campaign to the DNC in recent history,” they said. “Although Mike suspended his campaign, he remains committed to defeating Trump and we hope all our staff submit their names for positions with the DNC Coordinated Campaign this transfer will help fund.”  The spokesperson did not immediately confirm how many staffers were let go Friday or in the previous round. But Bloomberg had more than 2,000 people spread out across the country and hundreds more at his New York headquarters.  Bloomberg dropped out after a disastrous showing on Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden. Bloomberg’s hiring materials from headquarters shared with POLITICO stated that regardless of what happened to his own campaign, field organizers could expect to have a job with “Team Bloomberg” through November, though it didn’t promise interviewees where they would be based. It outlined that organizers would be paid $6,000 a month, plus a $5,000 relocation stipend and full health, dental and vision benefits. In one staff email, an aide cited Campaign Manager Kevin Sheekey’s March 6 note in which he pasted a news report reiterating plans to keep field operations going in the half-dozen battleground states regardless of whether Bloomberg became the nominee. A spokesperson confirmed that was the plan after the first round of layoffs earlier this month. The pledge was so well established in some non-battleground states that it was used as a frequent motivator by supervisors to encourage sometimes exhausted staffers. It was also raised in at least two statewide training sessions where officials traveled from headquarters. On the Pennsylvania call, a woman asked Kinross whether the state campaign knew whether the DNC was going to try to keep people who have uprooted their entire lives to the state of Pennsylvania. “No, we don't, we don’t ...There’s no answer,” he replied. “All the decisions are going to be the DNC’s.”",Bloomberg lays off hundreds as coronavirus bears down,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-campaign-layoffs-coronavirus-139362,politico
"After more than 12 hours of negotiations, top Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators — joined by senior Trump administration officials — were unable to reach an agreement Friday night on a massive $1 trillion-plus bill to rescue the U.S. economy from the growing coronavirus crisis.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) convened the bipartisan discussions on Friday morning, urging both sides to have a deal — or at least the framework of an agreement — in place by the end of the day so the Senate could vote on the package by Monday. But talks will now go into the weekend. And Republicans warned that they would begin drafting their own bills Saturday, even without a bipartisan accord.  ""There's still some significant outstanding issues, very significant to our side, that they haven't agreed to,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.   Schumer said Friday evening that he was ""hopeful"" a deal can be reached but negotiators still had a long way to go.   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel oversees a big portion of the economic-relief package, said there are ""three or four [issues] that have to be worked out.""  Among the unresolved issues are increased unemployment insurance payments, significant financial assistance for hospitals and health-care providers to treat coronavirus victims, and a proposed ""State Stabilization Fund,” which is intended to address billions of dollars in looming revenue shortfalls suffered by state governments during the emergency.  But Republicans believe that Democrats won't block any rescue bill over fear of the potential political fallout.  ""As I said, there's been a lot of good conversations, a lot of substantial progress, but with the way the schedule is now accelerated in the Senate, the Senate needs to begin drafting legislative text, and they'll turn to that next,"" said White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland.  Ueland added that the White House and Senate Republicans ""are very hopeful"" that Democrats ""won't elect to grind it to a halt or gridlock it on the floor because a lot of improvements made in the legislation involve reflection of the concepts that they brought to Senate Republicans and us over the next several hours.""  McConnell's proposed timetable for finishing work on what is likely to turn out to be the most expensive economic rescue package in American history sets an incredibly ambitious pace. Republicans and White House say there is an urgent need to address the growing public-health emergency, and McConnell is already preparing to take the procedural moves needed to make that happen.  The negotiations began Friday morning in the historic Hart 216 room, where Supreme Court nominations and crucial hearings often are held, and then shifted to the Finance Committee's offices as four ""task forces"" and sub-groups met. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spent the day huddled with senators from both parties as they searched for an agreement. Mnuchin also had multiple phone conversations with Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to try to work through problems in the ""Phase 3"" package.   “I tasked these bipartisan teams to reach agreement by the end of the day today, tonight,” McConnell said. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we’ve agreed to … We’ll need tomorrow for Legislative Counsel to draft the agreement. And as [Mnuchin] has indicated, it is important for us to be on the Senate floor and pass the measure by Monday.”  The four task forces — which covered distressed industries, small business, financial assistance to individual Americans and health care — took a ""pause"" in the middle of Friday afternoon while Republicans huddled for a policy lunch and Senate aides rushed to put the proposals into writing.   Yet it was clear by early evening that McConnell's midnight deadline was going to be missed. Both sides said they would begin again early Saturday morning.  The high-level talks come a day after Senate Republicans introduced their $1 trillion stimulus package to save the U.S. economy by assisting individuals, small businesses and industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.   But Senate Democrats argue the GOP proposal overall benefits businesses and industries while not doing enough for average Americans.   Schumer, who also spoke to President Donald Trump Friday morning, asked the president to use the Defense Production Act for more medical equipment, including ventilators, according to Schumer’s spokesperson.   During a sometimes angry 90-minute press conference at the White House, Trump said he had an “extremely good” conversation with the minority leader and expressed optimism about the “Phase 3” stimulus deal.   ""We were working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will,” Trump said at a daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. He didn’t address the Defense Production Act.  Trump added that he also spoke at length with McConnell as well.  Among the key provisions of the Senate GOP plan is direct cash payments to individuals of up to $1,200 and families of up to $2,400, based on income. In addition to direct cash payments, the GOP stimulus plan gives small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans and $200 billion for loans for industries, including airlines.   The structure of the direct payments has emerged as a concern for some Republican members, in addition to Democrats. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has panned the idea of direct cash payments broadly, while Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are calling for the package to be fixed, after expressing concern that its structure doesn’t sufficiently benefit lower income Americans. Hawley introduced an amendment Friday to help resolve the issue.  ""Our goal is to create an income stream not just a one-time payment,"" Graham said Friday. ""The problem with direct cash is you're giving it to the people who have got their salary, they don't need extra money. There are people without money that need money.""  Senate Republican aides and White House officials are signaling they’re open to making changes during negotiations.  But Republican leaders also brought in Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to counter the Democratic call for using the existing state-based unemployment insurance system to dole out money to those in need. Scalia argued in the closed-door sessions that some states' unemployment systems aren't capable of handling both an expected tidal wave of new unemployment filings by Americans who just lost their jobs while at the same time gearing up to send out millions of checks.  ""The administration has expressed, based on some feedback they’re getting from states, that that would take a very long time,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.C.). ""Again, we're trying to do something that's quick and gets an infusion of cash out there in a hurry, and the direct payments do that.""  There are also objections being raised to some of the industry specific bailout, as well as numerous business-related tax cuts offered by Senate Republicans. Democrats claim that the GOP bill is not ""worker friendly,"" and note that one of the provisions floated by Republicans would give a tax break to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. ""That is a complete non-starter on our side,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), top Democrat on the Finance Committee.  And Trump himself said he wanted to make sure there was language in the Senate package preventing corporations from using federal aid for stock buybacks.  ""We have some fundamental disagreements on some of the liquidity provisions,"" said a Republican senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. We're trying to help not because we're interested in helping business ... as much as we’re just trying to help keep the economy moving and keep people employed.""  In addition to Mnuchin, Scalia, and Ueland, administration officials participating Friday include former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow.   ""Very good attitude, the children are playing well,"" Kudlow said when asked about the tenor of the discussions.  The Republican senators attending the talks are McConnell, Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (Idaho), Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.), Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Aging Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (Maine), Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (Miss.) and Thune.   Among the Senate Democrats participating are Schumer, Wyden, Commerce Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Minority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.), Small Business Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (Md.), Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez (N.J.), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) , Sen. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) and Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.). HELP Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray participated by phone.   Lawmakers are trying to move as quickly as they can and are expected to work through the weekend. McConnell has vowed the Senate will not leave Washington until a deal is reached.  ""There's been some good constructive discussions about the issues,"" Thune said. ""We're trying to narrow the list of the Democrat asks and the things Republicans want. We want feedback from the bill that we put out there ... We have about 12 hours to do it.""  Durbin, for his part, said Democrats ""proposed a number of new issues that have not been raised by the Republican plan."" Democrats want hundreds of billions of dollars for hospital and health-care providers that the GOP proposal doesn't presently include.  Schumer is closely consulting with Pelosi throughout the Senate negotiations. While Schumer is unlikely to agree to any major provision that Pelosi opposes, that doesn't mean House Democrats can't include additional initiatives when that chamber takes up the bill.  ""At the speaker's direction, House Majority committee staffs are working through Pelosi's policy operation to weigh in through Schumer staff on key provisions House Democrats want added to the McConnell proposal,"" said a senior Democratic aide.  McConnell, however, has refused to include Pelosi in the negotiations so far, despite pleas from both top Democrats to do so.

"Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on Friday asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review stock sales he made weeks before the markets began to tank in response to the coronavirus pandemic — a move designed to limit the fallout from an intensifying political crisis. Burr, who chairs the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, defended the sales, saying he “relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks"" and disputed the notion he used information that he was privy to during classified briefings on the novel coronavirus. Burr specifically name-checked CNBC’s daily health and science reporting from its Asia bureau. “Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” Burr said in a statement. Burr, who is retiring at the end of 2022, has faced calls to resign from across the ideological spectrum since ProPublica reported Thursday that he dumped between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 33 different transactions — a week before the stock market began plummeting amid fears of the coronavirus spreading in the U.S.  The North Carolina Republican has also come under fire for a secret recording obtained by NPR from Feb. 27, in which he issued a much more dire warning to a group of attendees at a private luncheon about the potential outbreak than the prognosis he was offering publicly at the time. Both liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson have called on Burr to step down. Carlson said ""there is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time of crisis"" and said Burr should resign and face prosecution for insider trading, if the report is true. Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, said it was ""stomach-churning"" that someone would think to ""profit off this crisis."" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is up for reelection this year in the Tar Heel state, didn’t go so far as to ask for Burr’s resignation, but did say Burr owes an explanation — and the pending Ethics probe now gives Tillis, and others, some cover to call for the investigation to play out. “Given the circumstances, Senator Burr owes North Carolinians an explanation. His self-referral to the Ethics Committee for their review is appropriate, there needs to be a professional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter, which the Ethics Committee can provide,” Tillis tweeted. The Ethics Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), is made up of three Republicans and three Democrats. The panel is notoriously slow and rarely takes punitive action against its peers, but with the Capitol focused on battling coronavirus — and some members limiting their interactions or being forced to go on self-quarantine — the probe could move at even more of a snail’s pace. ""Such a low-energy establishment Senate response,"" tweeted Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a firebrand conservative. ""'Self-referral' to 'Senate Ethics' is the safe space where Senators can judge their own w/o real culpability. You, Senator Tillis, referring Burr to the DOJ for prosecution would evidence a sincere concern for North Carolinians."" Burr infuriated Trump's conservative allies last year when he subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr., though they ended up working out the terms for an interview with his panel. Burr has acknowledged making at least one financial decision based on what he’s heard from federal officials: he said in 2009 that he encouraged his wife to withdraw cash from the ATM after hearing from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson amid the 2008 financial crisis. If Burr traded stocks based on information that was not available to the public, it could not only be an ethics issue, but a criminal matter as well. The 2012 STOCK Act prohibits members of Congress from insider trading. Former Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role in an insider trading case. Collins was a major investor in Innate Immunotherapeutics and even pitched the stock to fellow members. But Collins allegedly told his son about the firm's failed drug trial months before it was public, allowing his family members to dump their shares before the stock collapsed. Burr's committee was receiving regular classified briefings on coronavirus at the time of the stock sales, according to Reuters, but Burr has insisted that he used public reports to make investment decisions. In an initial statement, a spokesperson for Burr confirmed the transactions but noted they took place before the market volatility. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,"" his spokesperson said. ""As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy."" Burr also punched back at the NPR report on Twitter Thursday, calling it a ""tabloid-style hit piece"" and noting it was a publicized event that included ""many non-members, bipartisan congressional staff, and representatives from the governor’s office."" Burr is not the only one under scrutiny for their recent trading practices: Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sold off more than $1 million in stocks in the days and weeks following a private coronavirus meeting — then bought shares in a company that offers teleworking software, according to the Daily Beast. Loeffler, who is on the ballot this fall, was a wealthy business executive before being appointed to Congress late last year and is married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. “This is a ridiculous and baseless attack,” Loeffler wrote on Twitter. “I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement.” In an interview with CNBC, Loeffler declined to call for an Ethics probe into herself but said she would ""submit to whatever review is needed."" Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also sold significant stocks from their portfolios over the last several weeks, according to the New York Times, but Inhofe told reporters Friday that he did not attend a Jan. 24 briefing on the coronavirus. ""The answer is no, everybody knows I didn't do that,"" Inhofe said, when asked whether he made the sales to prevent coronavirus-related losses. ""I didn't even attend the meeting.""  Inhofe, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, added that he would cooperate with an Ethics investigation but said it's up to his colleagues to decide whether to open one. Common Cause, a Washington-based watchdog group, filed complaints against all four lawmakers — Burr, Loeffler, Inhofe and Feinstein — with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee, citing the STOCK Act. “These potential violations of insider trading laws and the STOCK Act by these Senators ... show what appears to be contempt for the law and further a contempt for the American people these Senators have sworn to serve,"" Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said in a statement. John Bresnahan and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report.",Burr moves to quell fallout from stock sales with request for Ethics probe,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/sen-richard-burr-requests-ethics-probe-into-his-stock-sales-138768,politico
"Joe Biden reached a new and heady milestone when he shellacked Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Ohio to become the de facto Democratic nominee for president. But there was no soaring speech to acknowledge the moment. He never took the stage amid a sea of Biden signs or before an adoring crowd on national television. Biden was instead stuck in a makeshift studio in his Delaware home, webcasting his remarks with a low-quality personal computer camera against a straight-out-of-YouTube black backdrop and two American flags. He warned about the coronavirus contagion. He offered an olive branch to Bernie Sanders. Then, despite two consecutive weeks of smashing victories, he all but disappeared from the news cycle for days. The moment was a perfect distillation of Biden’s current predicament — in a state of suspended political animation, trapped between a rival who refuses to quit and the global pandemic that has all but shut down the Democratic primary campaign. Because Sanders won’t quit, Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. A source familiar with the Democratic National Committee’s discussions says the party offered both the Biden and Sanders campaigns the opportunity to open joint-fundraising accounts. But since Sanders declined, the party is reluctant to enter into one with Biden because of the bad optics of seeming to help one candidate. “That’s going to eventually hurt Biden with financing if the DNC doesn’t go ahead with this,” the source said. Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also can’t meet with donors at fundraisers — which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy that’s sinking into recession or perhaps worse. “It’s a tough position,” said Matt Littman, who’s hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software. “It’s harder to raise money when there’s no face-to-face meeting and personal contact,” Littman said. “And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I can’t count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.” For the foreseeable future, all live campaign events are canceled, so he can’t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked. His ability to criticize Trump on anything other than his performance on coronavirus response and preparedness is constrained by the emergency-like conditions. As new polling suggests that Trump’s approval for responding to the virus is improving, some of Biden’s fellow Democrats worry he’s paralyzed himself. “Biden is only in limbo if he keeps himself there. He’s only in a predicament to the degree he chooses to view himself in one,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran of progressive politics who is head of the Revolving Door Project, which watchdogs executive branch appointees. “Joe Biden can either complain about the fact that he is not getting significant media coverage or he could do something to change that,” Hauser said. “He needs to offer an alternative and offer a running play-by-play critique of the failings of this administration.” Biden aides and allies, however, are projecting an aura of calm, saying Trump’s false claims and reinvented history about the virus will haunt him on their own as the economy craters. The former vice president pledged to call him out on it by Monday — but made the statement via conference call Friday with reporters instead of on camera. Meanwhile, his staff is scattered, communicating via teleconferencing, email and conference call. Some remain holed up in Philadelphia apartments near campaign headquarters but others went home to Washington. A few are near the candidate in Wilmington, Delaware. Another is in the mountains of Puerto Rico. The headquarters and campaign trail now run through Biden’s living room as his staff scrambles to increase his social media outreach to compensate for the social distancing. The first step: installing a better video camera in Biden’s house, which will soon have broadcast-ready capabilities and high-quality livestreaming software. To limit the risk of infecting the candidate, the number of staffers is limited within the house. The campaign also plans to flood social media with Biden to promote the brand of the former vice president who helped lead the nation’s Ebola virus response, has a vast knowledge of domestic and foreign policy and is known both as comforter-in-chief as well as the ice-cream-eating, aviator-shade-wearing everyman parodied in The Onion. “The thing that’s good about Joe Biden and the way the internet thinks about him is that there is a sense of brand, people know him as vice president, and they know ice cream and aviators. For us, we have to evolve from ice cream and aviators and being vice president to being commander-in-chief, while remaining relatable and true to his personality. That's the balance,” said Rob Flaherty, Biden’s digital director. “Our digital operation is putting out five-minute Iran crisis explainers and koozies that say, ‘keep it cool kid.’ It’s always been this tension,” Flaherty said. “And for us, the challenge and the opportunity is how we keep it between the buoys and present the best image of Joe Biden.” To increase voters’ sense of intimacy with Biden — who revels in one-on-one time with voters after public events — the campaign is discussing ways to find the technology and invent a “virtual rope-line” in which voters would wait in an electronic “queue” to speak with him briefly face-to-face, albeit via livestream. The campaign is also planning to hold more tele-town halls and is discussing a Biden podcast, in addition to pumping out more video clips of him. In some ways, the Biden campaign wants to give followers and viewers a sense of Biden as if he were a character in a reality show, building a loyal following online similar to the way former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s campaign did. Flaherty, who was O’Rourke’s digital director, said Biden’s social media presence will be unique to him. So unlike O’Rourke, Biden won’t be livestreaming from the dentist office chair or skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot. Flaherty said the campaign always planned to have a heavy social-media focus. The only major difference now is the campaign is completely online and it has to ramp up faster and on a bigger scale. From the start, the campaign was designed to limit the news media’s interactions with Biden due to his reputation for gaffes and going off-script, which in some ways makes Biden’s social distancing a boon — his campaign can more tightly control his image. Rallies, after all, are only a small part of a campaign, said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager. “The vast majority of voters don't interact with campaigns by attending rallies. They experience the campaign through TV coverage, social media, and advertising, and contact from volunteers, all of which will still continue,” Mook said. “This isn't the end of the campaign trail, but rather it's full transition into the digital space.” But the Biden campaign knows that time is precious. Trump’s campaign is preparing to unload on Biden to negatively define him before he’s the nominee and consolidates his base, which is harder now with Sanders still hanging around. Trump already has a far-bigger social media following, presence and reach than Biden. “With respect to the Trump camp — the entire right in general — they’re all rallying against one candidate: Biden. It’s so concentrated. But on the left, it’s still pretty fractured,” said Glenn Parham, founder of the Republican political intelligence firm Pundit Analytics. “The left is starting to funnel into Biden, but a lot of different advocacy groups are running attack ads against Joe and are supporting other candidates, even ones that have dropped out, which is kind of absurd.”  On the right, he said, the volume and concentrated fire “are orders of magnitude greater than on the left.” While Trump is more negatively affected on the campaign trail by coronavirus than Biden — the president’s campaign revolves around his big rallies — he has been able to occupy center stage by giving a daily White House press briefing. Joe Lockhart, former White House spokesman for the Clinton administration, said Biden needs to carefully calibrate his response to Trump. “It’s very tricky. When you’re in a crisis, there can only be one president. Just attacking him every day is a bad strategy,” said Lockhart, anticipating the Trump campaign’s response leveled Friday at Biden. “Where I think Biden is going is if he gives a series of strategic speeches that talk about the importance of preparing, the importance of government pulling together and the importance of being straight with the American public,” Lockhart said. Steve Schale, leader of the pro-Biden super PAC Unite The Country, said voters might still want an abeyance in the appearance of politicking in a time of crisis, at least in the short term. Schale said he was supposed to be on the road this week raising money from donors — a task made easier by Biden’s emergence as the all-but-certain nominee. But he’s stuck at home along with nearly everyone else. “This is affecting everyone’s lives in ways we didn’t imagine, not just Biden,” Schale said. “There’s no playbook for this.”",’There’s no playbook for this’: Biden trapped in campaign limbo,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coranavirus-puts-biden-in-limbo-138726,politico
"The United Nations Security Council, a premier global forum, hasn’t yet held a session on the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe. The European Union is trying to limit exports of key medical supplies to nations beyond its borders — while its own members are barely helping one another.  Financial institutions worldwide have only recently started cooperating to mitigate the economic damage from the rapidly spreading illness, but investors are still spooked.  And, the United States, led by President Donald Trump and his America First vision, is focused more on the virus’ internal challenge than its global impact. Instead of rallying the world, as it has in the past on major challenges, the U.S. is brawling with other countries affected by the crisis.  If there’s one thing the coronavirus has shown, it’s that a crisis that affects all of humanity does not necessarily inspire international unity, coordination or leadership. Instead, borders are closing, competition for resources is up, politicians are insulting one another, and no country is taking charge.  “This is a challenge that’s hitting every country at the same time, and we’re all working in our own little silos instead of working together,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former Obama administration official who oversaw disaster response. “There’s no attempt at global leadership from anyone right now, and we’re not going to win if ultimately we’re not working together on this.”  The difference in reaction is particularly stark when compared to the Ebola virus crisis, which — while more limited in geographical scope — nonetheless inspired a global response spearheaded by the U.S. under then-President Barack Obama.  As of Friday, the coronavirus had been spotted in over 150 countries, with more than 255,000 confirmed cases and over 10,000 deaths, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.  That number has grown quickly in recent weeks as Western officials have struggled to absorb the hard-won lessons of their counterparts in Asia, where draconian measures — in the case of China, which shut down entire regions — and more innovative tactics in Singapore and South Korea have beaten back the disease.  As the outbreak's center of gravity shifts to Europe and North America, the deadly illness is straining health care systems, as well as supply lines for medicines, ventilators and other critical items. It is shocking economies as governments close their borders, order quarantines and enact severe “social distancing” measures that are devastating retail businesses and roiling markets.  Instead of uniting, world powers are squabbling. On Friday, the White House circulated a video of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing Russia, China, Iran and others of spreading disinformation about the virus. Perhaps most glaringly, there’s been no significant international gathering of political leaders tasked with devising a global strategy to tackle the disease.  The closest thing to it came earlier this week when the leaders of countries in the Group of Seven — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — held a conference call on the virus.  The discussion reportedly took place at the urging of France’s President Emmanuel Macron. It yielded notable commitments, including pledges to work together on research and a vague promise to “coordinate our efforts to delay the spread of the virus, including through appropriate border management measures.”  But Trump has barely mentioned the call since. His earlier, sudden decision to impose a travel ban on Europe due to the virus had already surprised and upset key G-7 members, who complained that they had not been consulted. And seeing as the G-7 does not include major affected countries, such as China, its commitments — if carried out — will arguably have limited effect. (The G-7’s foreign ministers are due to hold a virtual meeting next week.)  Saudi Arabia has called for an emergency virtual summit next week of the leaders of the Group of 20, which does include China. But as of Friday, it was unclear when — or if — that session would happen. Saudi Arabia currently holds the group’s presidency, but its recent precipitous moves to slash oil prices have not helped soothe financial markets.  During a White House news conference Friday, Pompeo, who has kept an unusually low profile throughout the crisis, praised “the global leadership that America has always delivered” and claimed it “has been great to see countries around the world rally behind what we are doing.”  Pressed for examples, a senior Trump administration official pointed to U.S. plans to spend more than $1 billion to help the international community fight the pandemic.  The official added that the administration “has conducted numerous conference calls with science ministers from around the world, leading to actions on data sharing, clinical trials, enhanced access to data and research publications, and unity among the international science community.”  China’s communist leaders have taken perhaps the most visible moves aimed at burnishing their global credentials during the crisis.  Scientists believe the infectious disease emerged in China’s Hubei province last year. For weeks, the Chinese downplayed the disease, muzzling doctors and resisting allowing in a team from the World Health Organization. Eventually, Beijing used extreme means to limit the spread of the illness, and the country claims to have brought it under control.  In recent days, China has sent supplies and experts to other countries fighting the illness. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has taken a high profile amid the sudden Chinese generosity, and his state-controlled media machine has promoted China’s authoritarian governance model as best suited for dealing with such an enemy. Still, there are signs that China is reluctant to take too bold a stance. For one thing, China currently holds the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, and yet it has not convened a session on the coronavirus.  When asked why the Security Council hasn’t met to discuss the pandemic, a senior U.N. diplomat told POLITICO: “They just haven’t,” adding, “We’re able to support them either virtually or even if they want to meet in person.”  Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  While rare, holding a U.N. Security Council session on a health crisis is not without precedent; one was held on the Ebola crisis.  One possible reason no Security Council session has been called this time is the ongoing war of words over the virus between China and another permanent, veto-wielding member: the United States.  Chinese officials have been floating conspiracy theories alleging that the coronavirus may have originated outside their borders, possibly even at the hands of the U.S. military.  In response, Trump, Pompeo and some Republican lawmakers have been calling the illness the “Chinese virus” or similar terms, angering Beijing. U.S. officials also keep hammering China for its original lack of candor about the seriousness of the outbreak, though Trump has praised Xi personally for his handling of it.  At times, Trump has even appeared to welcome the pandemic’s rapidly mounting consequences for the world order, claiming he was happy to see Americans stay home and buy their goods from U.S. factories. There are few signs, however, that he is deeply engaged with cajoling or negotiating with other leaders to coordinate their plans for combating the virus.  At the United Nations, the main organization involved in a global response to the virus is the WHO. On other U.N. fronts, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are trying to help relief groups navigate the viral terrain as they aid vulnerable populations such as refugees.  But these are largely technical bodies, not ones that can hammer out political agreements — or at least guidelines — on issues like medical supply lines, financial assistance and border policies.  When countries have come to agreements related to the virus, it’s often been bilateral — such as the Canada-U.S. decision to limit border crossings — or through regional blocs, such as the EU.  Those agreements, however, could have negative impacts elsewhere on Earth.  In Europe, countries have been hoarding medical supplies, with some putting up restrictions on exports of items such as face masks. The EU stepped in, announcing limits on exports of such materials outside the bloc in an effort to boost availability within.  Researchers are warning, however, that those new external limits could hurt other, poorer countries that need Europe to supply such equipment. Europe’s move could also prompt nations outside the bloc to restrict their exports of materials European nations will require.  G-7 finance ministers and central bankers pledged on March 3 to use “all appropriate policy tools” to keep their economies afloat. But stock markets continued to fall, and financial institutions across the world have begun stepping up their actions in recent days.  Several central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have taken what appear to be coordinated actions to stabilize the markets, such as buying bonds, cutting interest rates and re-opening emergency lending programs last used during the financial crisis of 2008.  The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said earlier this month that they “stand ready to help our member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by the COVID-19 virus.”  But such financial promises also run into political realities, such as whether the IMF should lend funds to Venezuela, Iran and other countries whose regimes are opposed by the United States, a major global financial player.  Former U.S. officials and analysts who watch multilateral institutions note that the coronavirus is simply unprecedented in its geographical scope and the resulting implications. The virus, officially called COVID-19, is a new strain that scientists are still trying to understand, and it has even stricken some government officials who would be involved in planning a response.  “Who can muster an international response when no one can travel, when countries are in lockdown? Even within countries you can’t travel,” one former senior State Department official said.  They note, however, that there’s one past model that offers some lessons: The U.S.-led response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. That crisis began in the early months of 2014, with an outbreak in Guinea. Over the next several months, cases appeared in neighboring countries. The WHO stepped in to help, with assistance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In August, as global concern grew over the vicious illness, Obama used a gathering of African leaders in the United States to raise awareness of the crisis and pledge continued U.S. support. By mid-September, Obama announced that, among other measures, the U.S. would send 3,000 troops to West Africa to help build medical facilities and offer other aid to medical professionals. Obama seemed aware of criticism that he’d moved too slowly, saying, “We have to act fast — we can’t dawdle on this one” and adding that “this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response.”  That same week, the U.N. Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution declaring Ebola a threat to world peace and security. The meeting was led by the United States, which held the Security Council’s rotating presidency at the time. U.N. observers said it was a rare, possibly unprecedented council session due to its focus on a public health crisis.  Days later, during the annual gathering of the U.N. General Assembly, a special high-level meeting was held on the issue of the Ebola virus. Speaking to those gathered, Obama warned that the global community was “not doing enough.”  In the ensuing weeks and months, other countries joined or stepped up efforts to help West African states contain the illness. Although some Republicans insisted Obama fumbled the response (and Trump was a critic, too), the former Democratic president’s aides defend his approach.  With the coronavirus, “there’s been a complete absence of anything like that,” said Konyndyk, who helped lead the Ebola response under Obama. “Our diplomatic toolbox is more absent despite the fact that it’s more necessary.”  Among those arguing for a more united international front against the coronavirus is U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  In what his office dubbed a “virtual press encounter” Thursday, Guterres called on world leaders to “come together and offer an urgent and coordinated response to this global crisis.”  “Current responses at the country level will not address the global scale and complexity of the crisis,” he warned.",World leaders are fighting the virus.

"Barren streets, vacant offices and empty gyms. A quarantined small California town of 2,600, guarded by military officials. Rationing medical care. Government turf wars and bureaucratic battles.  All of these scenes unfolded on the screen before me—not on cable news television—but in a generation’s worth of Hollywood blockbusters and a six-part miniseries about viral epidemics.  On the first weekend of our national emergency, I self-quarantined inside my apartment. I socially distanced from hundreds of St. Patrick’s Day revelers who crowded inside a white party tent and listened to a blaring Bon Jovi cover band outside the Irish pub across the street below. Then, I binge-watched nearly 10 hours of virus entertainment, from 1995’s “Outbreak” to 2019’s “The Hot Zone.”  While I didn’t emerge as a postdoc epidemiologist, the lessons I took away, hidden in plain sight all these years, would be valuable to any member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. It’s all there, from Contagion’s advocacy for social distancing to Outbreak’s and Hot Zone’s depictions of how interagency squabbling can slow responses. Even the epigraph of “Outbreak,” from the Nobel laureate and bacteriologist Joshua Lederberg, should have focused us on the gravity of a pandemic earlier: “The single biggest threat to man’s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.” But I also noticed something else: These films have perhaps numbed us to those very viruses that threaten us most—the viruses that do not have a giant fatality rate or change our physical appearance. In “Outbreak,” Dustin Hoffman’s Col. Sam Daniels, a virologist with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, contends with Motaba, a fever-inducing virus that kills 100 percent of its patients in two to three days. In “The Hot Zone,” Ebola leaves its patients with a rash and kills them quickly. In “Contagion,” MEV-1 has a mortality rate around 20 percent. If Motaba had hit the U.S. the government would have been faster to quarantine cities and issue shelter-in-place orders, shutting down schools and non-essential businesses. Had Ebola been spreading around Indianapolis, I bet those revelers across the street would have stayed at home. But my neighbors seemed blind to COVID-19, which is more insidious and subtly dangerous than the diseases from the movies. Its mortality rate is in the single digits —low enough so many think they have little to fear—but it is proving just as disabling to the economy and our way of life, if not more, than much more deadly outbreaks, which can be contained faster.  Earlier this week, I asked Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist, why all of these movies hadn’t moved politicians and voters to take viral epidemics more seriously. “I don’t think movies change the way people feel about things,” he told me, adding that he was working with the writer of “Contagion,” Scott Z. Burns, on a public awareness campaign ad on the novel coronavirus.  “The fact that the United States has dodged the bullet with all of the latest infectious diseases, my perception of our government is that unless it’s screaming hot in the headlines, nothing will be done,” says Tracey McNamara, a technical consultant on “Contagion” and a veterinary medicine professor at Western University of Health Services, told me. “Contagion,” hints at our lackadaisical approach to any virus that isn’t produced in a Hollywood studio: There’s a scene in which a reporter asks Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Administrator Dr. Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne, whether the government is overreacting to a virus that would claim 26 million lives in 29 days.  “Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here, after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?” the reporter asks.  “I’d rather the news story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn’t do enough,” Cheever replies.  Set pieces and dramatic press conference scenes like this one seemed a critical part of any disaster movie. Now, we see them almost everyday when the coronavirus task force briefs the nation. For decades, these films have thrilled theatergoers with an invisible enemy, the stark reality of an apocalyptic human-versus-nature, us-versus-it conflict. But the actual conflict in all of these films is actually something different: It’s us versus the bureaucracy. These are not so much films about disasters as they are films about government.  “Contagion is such a compelling film—life is unfolding very much like the movie,” says McNamara, who discovered West Nile Virus in the summer of 1999 while working as the chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, when crows started falling from the sky and falling into our exhibits that August. “The speed with which it spread. How it spread.” Turns out, Hollywood has been offering Washington clues about how a pandemic might transpire for decades—and what the government should do to fight it. Here are just a few: Much of “Outbreak” revolves around the efforts of the protagonist (Col. Sam Daniels, played by Dustin Hoffman) to convince his boss, Brigadier General William Ford (played by Morgan Freeman) that the country faces a real threat from the fictional Motaba virus. Daniels spends much of the film battling with Army General Donald McClintock, played by Donald Sutherland, to get the word out about the dangers of the virus.  After Daniels’ ex-wife, CDC staffer Dr. Roberta “Robby” Keough—played by Rene Russo—treats a dying and infected patient, she laments not getting a CDC advisory out about the virus faster. The CDC staffers’ efforts were blocked by her superiors. “I should’ve forced the alert,” the doctor says, explaining Motaba’s deadly effects. “Christ, Sam. I opened this guy up,” she tells her ex. “Looked like a bomb went off inside. His pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen—all the organs were liquified. Christ, I should’ve forced the alert.” In “Contagion,” weeks into the outbreak of MEV-1, Dr. Sanjay Gupta (played by himself) asks CDC Administrator Cheever how many people have died from the disease during a cable television appearance. The answer, Cheever admits, was “very difficult” to know exact numbers because reporting varied by state. “There are 50 different states in this country, which means there are 50 different health departments. Followed by 50 different protocols.” And in the final episode of “The Hot Zone,” a dispute between an Ebola researcher and the head of the CDC almost derails efforts to get to the bottom of the Reston, Virginia, Ebola outbreak.  “The guy hates my guts,” Walter said of the CDC official Trevor Rhodes (James D’Arcy). “I’m never going to convince him to help.”  “You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You got no choice.” The messages of all these films—infighting and turf battles make things worse—felt apt for the ongoing feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a branch of HHS that operates independently. “A series of incidents over the past 120 days suggest basic communication and coordination between CMS and HHS is lacking, thereby jeopardizing HHS’ mission and undermining public trust,” HHS chief information officer Jose Arrieta wrote a recent memo. The latest incident? On February 23, HHS’ email system crashed, causing vital messages about the emergency coronavirus funding package to be delayed for up to 11 hours. The cause: Verma’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had failed to brief HHS leaders about a test that would send thousands of messages through the system. The outage slowed the administration’s response to the deadly outbreak.  In the six-part National Geographic mini-series “The Hot Zone,” based on the 1994 non-fiction book by Richard Preston, Wade Carter, a fictionalized reclusive Ebola expert who studied the virus in the field, is frustrated that more senior officials aren’t taking the threat of Ebola on American soil more seriously. Carter tells Army Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies), a veterinarian who helped contain Ebola-infected monkeys from the Philippines: “Did I want this? Never. Now it’s here. Would it be good for the Oval Office to be pissing its pants about this now? You bet.”  But by the end of the series, after the scientists ultimately contained an Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, there seems to be little appetite from public policymakers to take the threat of an epidemic seriously. We see a flyover shot of Capitol Hill. In a nameless committee room, the deputy secretary of the National Institutes of Health asks Jaax: “So no one died?”  “That’s correct, Mr. Chairman,” Jaax says. “But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus.  “And 172 people were tested and came up negative,” the deputy secretary responded, unperturbed.  The warning was clear: When scientists are worried, people should listen. And yet, not more than a week ago, President Donald Trump and some Republican members of Congress, along with conservative television hosts, were saying that journalists and Democrats were overplaying the threat of the coronavirus. Now some of those pols who thought it was no big deal are getting tested for COVID-19 themselves.  In “The Hot Zone,” Jaax’s husband, Noah Emmerich’s Lt. Col. Jerry Jaax, makes a plea: “It’s no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development”—meaning that the CDC was caught somewhat flat-footed by the outbreak in Reston.  But back in real life, just last week, even as coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought defended the Trump administration’s proposed $35 million cut to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, designed for use by the CDC.  Rep. Matt Cartwright, the Democratic member from Pennsylvania, bristled at the cuts in a hearing with Vought. “The question is today, as we sit here and we know about coronavirus and the impact it’s taking on the people of the world and the economies of the world and the stock market and everything, as you sit here today, are you ready to take that back?” In none of the virus movies I watched do we see the U.S. president. He or she is often one of the least important characters. In “Contagion,” he’s moved underground. In “Outbreak,” we only see the chief of staff, talking White House officials through the ethics of bombing a California town, executing all of its citizens in order to contain Mataba. Instead, the most important characters—the ones who do the talking—are the public health officials, virologists, researchers and frontline healthcare workers. In the movies, scientists always offer a clear explanation and as much information as they have to concerned citizens. Politicians would only get in the way. President Donald Trump didn’t get the memo. His statements about coronavirus have been perplexing and counterproductive. He said we have it “under control.” He compared it to the flu. He told people with the virus to go to work. He suggested the virus would “disappear.” Then he declared a national emergency. In contrast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a global health official at the State Department who is now White House coronavirus response coordinator, are lucid, calm presenters of information—perhaps the administration’s most credible spokespeople. If this were a Hollywood movie, those two would have been doing most of the talking from the beginning.  Bryan Cranston, who plays Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in “Contagion,” alludes to a congressman who is at risk of infecting his fellow members of Congress with MEV-1. “There’s a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.,” Haggerty says. “He was in Chicago over the holiday. They are using the pod to fly him home, and then they are closing Midway and O’Hare. The governor there is calling out the national guard. They are setting up roadblocks. They are shutting down the board of trade, public transportation. Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.”  Any policymaker who watched that scene and connected the dots wouldn’t have been able to escape the realization that in the event of a pandemic, it would be important for Congress to have a way of working remotely. This week, several representatives and senators directed some staffers to work from home. Still, members of Congress, many of whom are at risk of higher mortality rates given their average age—57.8 years in the House and 61.8 years in the Senate— don’t have an established way to conduct their business remotely. The Wolfgang Petersen film “Outbreak” is perhaps the least subtle of the group of films. A lab clinician infected with Motaba sees a movie with his girlfriend. As a result, the entire town of Cedar Creek, California—population 2,600—is nearly bombed with the “the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal” by the U.S. government to contain the spread of the virus.  When Daniels and Keough survey the infected at a makeshift hospital in Cedar Creek, Keough remarks: “So many—so fast.”  “Apparently they all gathered at a movie theater,” Daniels replies.  In “Contagion,” the CDC administrator urges social distancing and not shaking hands as the best advice for controlling the spread of MEV-1. We see empty gyms and open-floor plan offices. “Right now, our best defense has been social distancing,” Fishburne’s Cheever, the CDC director, tells Dr. Sanjay Gutpa in a cable television studio. “No handshaking. Staying home when you are sick. Washing your hands frequently.”  The idea for the scene came from Lipkin, the Columbia University epidemiologist who told the film’s writer, Scott Z. Burns, that he would serve as a technical adviser on the movie if he agreed to make it as scientifically accurate a film as possible.  In the film’s emotional denouement, Cheever visits the home of one the CDC’s janitors to deliver a vaccine, where he explains to the janitor’s son the origins of the handshake. (The scene was “designed” to disclose the history of the handshake,” Lipkin told me in an interview earlier this week.  “Do you know where this comes from? Shaking hands?” he asks the boy, after delivering the vaccine by pushing a swab up his nostril. “It was a way of showing a stranger you weren’t carrying a weapon in the old days.”  These days, we are all presumed to be armed and dangerous.",What I Learned About Coronavirus From Binge-watching 10 Hours of Virus Movies,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/21/pandemic-movies-coronavirus-140043,politico
"David Zuckerman, the lieutenant governor of Vermont, is an eccentric longtime figure in state politics — a ponytail-sporting organic farmer and Bernie Sanders protege who has proudly fought against government-mandated vaccinations.  But the arrival of the coronavirus has suddenly put Zuckerman on the defensive in his campaign for governor this year: Amid the worsening pandemic, one of his top Democratic opponents is calling out his anti-vaxxer views as dangerous, and attempting to make them politically toxic. “In moments like this, we see just how critical it is that we support vaccines and make them as available as possible,” said Rebecca Holcome, the state’s former education secretary who is challenging Zuckerman for the Democratic nomination in the August primary to take on popular Republican incumbent Gov. Phil Scott. “It's scary that anyone in public office or seeking public office would cast doubt about the value of vaccines. It's unbelievable this is even up for debate."" Zuckerman shot back that Holcome is trying to use a public health crisis to score political points. “The fact that any political campaign is trying to use this moment for political opportunism is unconscionable,” he told POLITICO. “Right now, my primary focus is to disseminate important health information about the virus and how to keep Vermonters, their families and our community safe...When the COVID-19 vaccine is available for the coronavirus it should be free for all and universally accessible.” The fight in Vermont’s Democratic gubernatorial primary sets up a larger test of how mainstream the “anti-vaxxer” movement has become on the left, and whether the coronavirus pandemic could make it politically untenable even in liberal bastions. Anti-vaccine advocacy is a growing force in American politics and around the globe as formerly fringe activists have developed a wide reach across social media platforms. Other candidates who oppose mandatory vaccinations are running for office, and some are winning, with support from large and well-funded advocacy groups.  Recently-ousted Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin has said that mandatory vaccines are un-American. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has repeatedly said parents should be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children. With backing by the group Texans for Vaccine Choice as well as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, libertarian Susanna Dokupil is making another run for the state legislature, primarying one of the most vocally pro-vaccine Republicans in Austin.  But the movement has had even more success in blocking pro-vaccine legislation, defeating efforts in New Jersey, California and other states that would have eliminated exemptions to immunization. Zuckerman, 48, has faced fierce criticism from Republican opponents in past races for his position on vaccinations, yet still won. He is seen as the frontrunner in an August primary for the Democratic nomination, though Scott is favored to win reelection. But Holcome is betting that the anxiety surrounding coronavirus will make the issue more salient and perhaps will force a reckoning with the anti-vaxx left. That movement includes several high-profile celebrities along with former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, a vocal skeptic of mandatory vaccinations, campaigned for Sanders after she dropped out of the race. Last year, the World Health Organization labeled what it called “vaccine hesitancy” one of the top 10 threats to global health, citing a 30% increase in measles cases worldwide. Vaccine skepticism is often tied to populist political movements on the right and the left. It’s part of a bigger surge of anti-establishment anger around the world — including in the U.S., where less than half the population gets vaccinated against the seasonal flu, which has killed tens of thousands in the past year alone. Despite past blowback for his positions, Zuckerman has remained firm in his opposition to mandatory vaccinations. He was called a “hero” by the co-founder of a Vermont “vaccine choice” group during his 2016 bid for lieutenant governor. In 2015, while serving in the state Senate, Zuckerman strongly opposed a bill that repealed the “philosophical exemption” to vaccinations which ultimately passed. And in a 2018 debate while running for reelection, he defended his past positions by arguing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has financial connections with the pharmaceutical industry that made him skeptical of its recommendations. “The CDC’s infectious disease control board actually has a number of conflicts of interests,” he argued. “And so yes, like many, I do sometimes question when government agencies are a bit too infused with corporate influence with respect to some of the outcomes and decisions they make.”  Yet Zuckerman has thrived politically, and some Vermont Democratic officials speculate he could someday succeed Sanders, a longtime ally, in the Senate. Sanders’ presidential campaign declined to comment on Zuckerman, but one aide noted that Sanders supports mandatory vaccinations with ""very limited exceptions.” The aide said “there are some health exceptions“ but declined to provide further details on which exceptions he supports. Many in the so-called “anti-vaxxer” community have tried in recent years to make their position more politically palatable by arguing that while they believe vaccines are effective, they are opposed to the government requiring them. Zuckerman has taken a similar messaging approach. In the 2018 debate, Zuckerman said “the science behind vaccines is sound, I think vaccines do good for our communities, my daughter is vaccinated. But it’s a question of whether government should be forcing that onto individuals.” Public health experts say such arguments put vulnerable people at risk. Even before the recent coronavirus pandemic, several states had been moving to eliminate religious and other exemptions for childhood vaccinations, as measles and other diseases have resurged in recent years.  “That's a dangerous message, that everyone should decide for themselves,” said Lois Privor-Dumm, a senior researcher on global vaccine policy at Johns Hopkins University. “If [people who forego vaccines] want to keep themselves quarantined all the time, that’s one thing. But that’s not what happens in life. So it's not appropriate for candidates to go against all the public health experts out there.” While campaigning in 2016 the Republican primary, Donald Trump also argued without evidence there is a correlation between vaccines and autism, a position which drew rebuke from the medical and scientific community as well as fellow candidate Ben Carson, a brain surgeon who now serves as his secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  As president, however, Trump shifted his position. In response to a number of Measles outbreaks in 2019, Trump told parents that their children “have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important.”",Anti-vaxx politicians under fire as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/anti-vaccine-coronavirus-137446,politico
"While Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sought on Friday to explain sales of stock made at a time when they were reassuring the public about the coronavirus threat, they weren’t the only elected officials to buy and sell stocks at key moments in the unfolding crisis. A POLITICO review of stock sales and purchases reported by members of Congress and senior aides found that while none had engaged in sales of the magnitude of Burr and Loeffler, several had traded shares at times or in industries that bore a relationship to the coronavirus threat. Previously unreported lawmakers who sold assets in the weeks leading up to the market crash include Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.), who unloaded thousands of dollars of stock in Alaska Air and Royal Caribbean cruises. A senior aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell made a mid-January purchase of Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology company that had four days earlier announced it would begin developing a coronavirus vaccine. And an aide to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sold off stock in companies including Delta Airlines in late January and later bought stock in Clorox, Inc., which makes bleach and sanitary wipes. The trades show that -- as much of the public was blindsided by both the pandemic and the economic meltdown over the last two weeks -- a number of lawmakers, aides and their brokers helping manage their portfolios adjusted their investments. Lawmakers in both chambers were being briefed via both classified and non-classified meetings about the coronavirus in late January and February, giving people on Capitol Hill a closer look at how the coming pandemic might shape their lives and finances that much of the country was lacking. “The reality is that if you work on the Hill, or you work in government, you have access to information that the public doesn't have or, if they have it, they can’t always see the signal through the noise,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of the watchdog group Issue One. “If you’re on the HELP Committee, you’re going to grasp threats much faster than the general public. You see things much more clearly.” Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Friday called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into his trades amid an uproar over reports that he had sought to safeguard his portfolio against the looming pandemic even as he assured the public all was well. Burr, who had been present for a classified briefing on the outbreak in late January, wrote an op-ed declaring the U.S. “better prepared than ever before” to face down the virus on Feb. 7 -- six days before unloading at least $628,000 of his own stock as the market was peaking.  The North Carolina Republican is one of several senators, including Loeffler, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. James Inhofe (R.-Okla.) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who sold stock in late January and early February as the Senate was ramping up coronavirus briefings. It’s illegal for lawmakers and aides to trade stocks based on private information. But they are allowed to buy and sell shares based on public information they absorb on Capitol Hill so long as they disclose those trades within 30 days. That permissive approach to buying and selling stocks -- the executive branch has much stricter rules -- has drawn criticism from watchdogs who argue the freedom to trade isn’t as important as the need for the public to trust Congress to act only on its behalf. Davis, the 10-term California Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Education and Labor Committees, unloaded stock on Feb. 11 in the airline and cruise industries, two sectors that have since been ground to a halt by the pandemic nearly two weeks before the market tanked. Davis’ spokesman said she has a “third party handling her portfolio and does not play a role in the purchase or sale of her stocks.” Other members stand to make money off companies working to combat the disease. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 of stock in the pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc., on Feb. 27, the day the company released a statement saying it had donated one of its antiviral drugs to China as an experimental option for treating the coronavirus and that it was exploring a research collaboration on potential treatment options.  Wittman’s office said he “does not have any involvement in investment decisions for his financial portfolio” and noted that AbbVie shares have since lost value. Still others were able to move their money to safe havens ahead of the general public. On Jan. 29, the day he and others were briefed on the coronavirus, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) sold between $500,001 and $1 million in Butte-Glenn municipal bonds. He and his wife moved over $2 million from local government bonds to U.S. Treasury notes, considered a port in the storm amid market turbulence, between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The muni bond market is currently facing strong headwinds. Peters’ office said he and his wife “sold one set of government bonds and bought other government bonds” and said the suggestion that it was linked to the virus briefing is “out of bounds.” Aides, who sometimes spend years working alongside their bosses on Capitol Hill and can play as much a role in shaping the response to a crisis as their bosses, also bought and sold stocks in January and February. Scott Sloofman, a top communications aide in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office, purchased stock in a company that could wind up being instrumental in the fight against the coronavirus in late January: Moderna, Inc., which is now testing the first vaccine for the disease in Washington state. Sloofman purchased the stock on Jan. 28, one week after Moderna, Inc. announced it was collaborating with the federal government to develop the vaccine. The company’s stock rose in the days since, at some points more than 20 percent. The purchase was listed as between $1,001 and $15,000 in value. A Senate aide familiar with the trade said Sloofman purchased just under $1,400 in stock. He bought the stock two weeks after seeing a CNBC segment featuring Moderna’s CEO discussing plans to develop new medications on Jan. 15, the aide said, and Sloofman does not focus on health care or national security policymaking for his job. Sarah Holmes, New Hampshire-based state director to New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and a longtime aide to the senator, sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Delta Airlines on Jan. 24, as lawmakers were beginning to be clued into the forthcoming crisis.  Holmes traded out two stocks a week later, on Jan. 29, then on Feb. 27 made two purchases that could prove advantageous in the weeks ahead: Holmes purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in each of two more companies, the pharmaceutical company Gilead, Inc. -- which makes remdesivir, a drug that is currently being tested to treat coronavirus -- and wipe manufacturer Clorox. The trades were made in a joint account, Shaheen spokesman Ryan Nickel said, and ""were made at the complete discretion of her broker with no input from Sarah or her husband.""  Additionally, the sale of the Delta stock on Jan. 24 was made prior to the classified Jan. 24 briefing for senators, Nickel said, at 9:30 a.m., and ""neither Senator Shaheen nor any of her staff were present for the classified briefing on Jan. 24."" Holmes does not have a security clearance and has complied with disclosure requirements, Nickel added. Though there is no current evidence that any of these elected officials or aides violated the law, there are several different bodies that could investigate lawmakers and aides for trading stocks. In addition to the ethics committees on Capitol Hill, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have the authority to launch probes of their own.  Burr and other lawmakers’ trades may be enough to spur a probe from the federal government, said Kevin Muhlendorf, a former investigator at the Department of Justice and SEC. “My gut on this is that based on the trading and the publicity, it’s highly likely that there will be some investigations by DOJ. I don't think the political nature of this is going to stop that,” said Muhlendorf. “It’s going to come down to very fact-specific inquiries: What were the sources of information? What was the timing of the trades? Those are going to all have to be scrutinized closely and thoroughly.”"," House members, Senate aides traded stocks in early days of coronavirus",2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coronavirus-trading-house-senate-140260,politico
"Joe Biden reached a new and heady milestone when he shellacked Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona to become the de facto Democratic nominee for president. But there was no soaring speech to acknowledge the moment. He never took the stage amid a sea of Biden signs or before an adoring crowd on national television. Biden was instead stuck in a makeshift studio in his Delaware home, webcasting his remarks with a low-quality personal computer camera against a straight-out-of-YouTube black backdrop and two American flags. He warned about the coronavirus contagion. He offered an olive branch to Bernie Sanders. Then, despite two consecutive weeks of smashing victories, he all but disappeared from the news cycle for days. The moment was a perfect distillation of Biden’s current predicament — in a state of suspended political animation, trapped between a rival who refuses to quit and the global pandemic that has all but shut down the Democratic primary campaign. Because Sanders won’t quit, Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. A source familiar with the Democratic National Committee’s discussions says the party offered both the Biden and Sanders campaigns the opportunity to open joint-fundraising accounts. But since Sanders declined, the party is reluctant to enter into one with Biden because of the bad optics of seeming to help one candidate. “That’s going to eventually hurt Biden with financing if the DNC doesn’t go ahead with this,” the source said. Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also can’t meet with donors at fundraisers — which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy that’s sinking into recession or perhaps worse. “It’s a tough position,” said Matt Littman, who’s hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software. “It’s harder to raise money when there’s no face-to-face meeting and personal contact,” Littman said. “And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I can’t count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.” For the foreseeable future, all live campaign events are canceled, so he can’t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked. His ability to criticize Trump on anything other than his performance on coronavirus response and preparedness is constrained by the emergency-like conditions. As new polling suggests that Trump’s approval for responding to the virus is improving, some of Biden’s fellow Democrats worry he’s paralyzed himself. “Biden is only in limbo if he keeps himself there. He’s only in a predicament to the degree he chooses to view himself in one,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran of progressive politics who is head of the Revolving Door Project, which watchdogs executive branch appointees. “Joe Biden can either complain about the fact that he is not getting significant media coverage or he could do something to change that,” Hauser said. “He needs to offer an alternative and offer a running play-by-play critique of the failings of this administration.” Biden aides and allies, however, are projecting an aura of calm, saying Trump’s false claims and reinvented history about the virus will haunt him on their own as the economy craters. The former vice president pledged to call him out on it by Monday — but made the statement via conference call Friday with reporters instead of on camera. Meanwhile, his staff is scattered, communicating via teleconferencing, email and conference call. Some remain holed up in Philadelphia apartments near campaign headquarters but others went home to Washington. A few are near the candidate in Wilmington, Delaware. Another is in the mountains of Puerto Rico. The headquarters and campaign trail now run through Biden’s living room as his staff scrambles to increase his social media outreach to compensate for the social distancing. The first step: installing a better video camera in Biden’s house, which will soon have broadcast-ready capabilities and high-quality livestreaming software. To limit the risk of infecting the candidate, the number of staffers is limited within the house. The campaign also plans to flood social media with Biden to promote the brand of the former vice president who helped lead the nation’s Ebola virus response, has a vast knowledge of domestic and foreign policy and is known both as comforter-in-chief as well as the ice-cream-eating, aviator-shade-wearing everyman parodied in The Onion. “The thing that’s good about Joe Biden and the way the internet thinks about him is that there is a sense of brand, people know him as vice president, and they know ice cream and aviators. For us, we have to evolve from ice cream and aviators and being vice president to being commander-in-chief, while remaining relatable and true to his personality. That's the balance,” said Rob Flaherty, Biden’s digital director. “Our digital operation is putting out five-minute Iran crisis explainers and koozies that say, ‘keep it cool kid.’ It’s always been this tension,” Flaherty said. “And for us, the challenge and the opportunity is how we keep it between the buoys and present the best image of Joe Biden.” To increase voters’ sense of intimacy with Biden — who revels in one-on-one time with voters after public events — the campaign is discussing ways to find the technology and invent a “virtual rope-line” in which voters would wait in an electronic “queue” to speak with him briefly face-to-face, albeit via livestream. The campaign is also planning to hold more tele-town halls and is discussing a Biden podcast, in addition to pumping out more video clips of him. In some ways, the Biden campaign wants to give followers and viewers a sense of Biden as if he were a character in a reality show, building a loyal following online similar to the way former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s campaign did. Flaherty, who was O’Rourke’s digital director, said Biden’s social media presence will be unique to him. So unlike O’Rourke, Biden won’t be livestreaming from the dentist office chair or skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot. Flaherty said the campaign always planned to have a heavy social-media focus. The only major difference now is the campaign is completely online and it has to ramp up faster and on a bigger scale. From the start, the campaign was designed to limit the news media’s interactions with Biden due to his reputation for gaffes and going off-script, which in some ways makes Biden’s social distancing a boon — his campaign can more tightly control his image. Rallies, after all, are only a small part of a campaign, said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager. “The vast majority of voters don't interact with campaigns by attending rallies. They experience the campaign through TV coverage, social media, and advertising, and contact from volunteers, all of which will still continue,” Mook said. “This isn't the end of the campaign trail, but rather it's full transition into the digital space.” But the Biden campaign knows that time is precious. Trump’s campaign is preparing to unload on Biden to negatively define him before he’s the nominee and consolidates his base, which is harder now with Sanders still hanging around. Trump already has a far-bigger social media following, presence and reach than Biden. “With respect to the Trump camp — the entire right in general — they’re all rallying against one candidate: Biden. It’s so concentrated. But on the left, it’s still pretty fractured,” said Glenn Parham, founder of the Republican political intelligence firm Pundit Analytics. “The left is starting to funnel into Biden, but a lot of different advocacy groups are running attack ads against Joe and are supporting other candidates, even ones that have dropped out, which is kind of absurd.”  On the right, he said, the volume and concentrated fire “are orders of magnitude greater than on the left.” While Trump is more negatively affected on the campaign trail by coronavirus than Biden — the president’s campaign revolves around his big rallies — he has been able to occupy center stage by giving a daily White House press briefing. Joe Lockhart, former White House spokesman for the Clinton administration, said Biden needs to carefully calibrate his response to Trump. “It’s very tricky. When you’re in a crisis, there can only be one president. Just attacking him every day is a bad strategy,” said Lockhart, anticipating the Trump campaign’s response leveled Friday at Biden. “Where I think Biden is going is if he gives a series of strategic speeches that talk about the importance of preparing, the importance of government pulling together and the importance of being straight with the American public,” Lockhart said. Steve Schale, leader of the pro-Biden super PAC Unite The Country, said voters might still want an abeyance in the appearance of politicking in a time of crisis, at least in the short term. Schale said he was supposed to be on the road this week raising money from donors — a task made easier by Biden’s emergence as the all-but-certain nominee. But he’s stuck at home along with nearly everyone else. “This is affecting everyone’s lives in ways we didn’t imagine, not just Biden,” Schale said. “There’s no playbook for this.”",’There’s no playbook for this’: Biden trapped in campaign limbo,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coranavirus-puts-biden-in-limbo-138726,politico
"OKLAHOMA CITY — This deeply conservative state is about to become a testing ground for turning a key piece of Obamacare into Trumpcare. Even before the coronavirus outbreak highlighted the potential cost of being uninsured, Oklahoma’s Republican governor was on the verge of joining the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, covering as many as 200,000 low-income adults. And there’s been little pushback from Republican legislators or conservative activists who have railed against Obamacare in the 10 years since its passage as an unaffordable, bureaucratic nightmare. But it’s not so simple. Oklahoma actually has two paths for expanding the safety net program. Voters could later this year decide to go for a straight expansion. Or under Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt’s preferred route, Oklahoma could become the first state to try and take up the Trump administration’s new offer of a block grant, part of a major conservative revamping of the program that’s been a high priority of this White House. Medicaid has long been an open-ended entitlement, with costs shared by the state and federal government. Under a block grant, there would be defined payment and the program would grow more slowly. Along with work requirements, block grants are a pillar of the GOP attempt to remake at least some portions of Obamacare after repeatedly failing to repeal it. What happens here in the Sooner State, which has the nation’s second-highest uninsured rate, could lay the groundwork for conservative states around the nation — including some that already expanded and the dozen-plus others who have steadfastly resisted providing Medicaid coverage to millions more of their poorest residents. Amber England, the energetic campaign manager behind the expansion ballot measure, argued her case before a dozen supporters on a back porch here on a temperate night earlier this month — less than a week before federal health officials would urge Americans to hunker down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. England polled the group on why they supported the campaign. A health care provider said he worried about a rash of rural hospital closures. One woman saw how Medicaid helped her brother receive care for multiple sclerosis before his death. Another said she had once lost her job; she had health insurance through her husband’s workplace but was shaken by the possibility of not having been so lucky. Oklahoma could soon join a recent wave of red states that expanded Medicaid through the ballot, defying Republican officials. While Obamacare remains unpopular with Republican voters, elements like Medicaid expansion and preexisting insurance protections have proven to be popular. Voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah in 2018 approved expansion, only for GOP-controlled legislatures to come back and pursue conservative policies to pare back the program, like adding work requirements. The Oklahoma ballot measure, Question 802, could prevent similar conservative detours by making Medicaid expansion part of the state’s constitution. That would make it virtually impossible for Stitt to go through with his plan — which is important, ballot initiative supporters argue, so that care isn’t capped. “There is a pattern here,” England told the group. “If you don't protect this health care in our constitution from the whims of politicians, specifically in election years, that this health care could be restricted or go away.” In late January, CMS Administrator Seema Verma announced a major Medicaid overhaul – and a potential lifeline for Stitt, who opposed expanding Medicaid during his campaign just over a year earlier. Stitt flew to Washington, D.C., to appear with Verma as she announced a long-awaited offer to let states radically restructure Medicaid financing for poor adults who enroll in Obamacare’s expansion. And Stitt had an announcement of his own: He would be the first to take up the Trump administration’s offer. The policy, dubbed the Healthy Adult Opportunity, is a radical departure for the 55-year-old safety net program. Instead of the federal government matching state spending as it does now, states would receive a defined sum and significant more flexibility to tailor enrollment standards and benefits. The concept, known as a block grant, has long had support from Republicans, who argue it would help cash-strapped states better manage and design their own programs. Democrats and Medicaid advocates contend it would lead to states cutting enrollment and services, especially in economic downturns and public health emergencies — like the ongoing pandemic that’s brought the country to a standstill. Oklahoma, which has some of the worst health outcomes of any state, wasn’t a likely candidate to be the first in line for a block grant. It doesn’t have the reputation for being a conservative pioneer in health policy. The looming ballot measure changed the calculus. Greg Treat, the Republican leader of the state Senate, is opposed to Medicaid expansion, and has been since he was a staffer for former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) during the debate over Obamacare. He doesn’t support the ballot initiative, but said he’s open to considering the governor’s plan, though he acknowledged concerns it could face court challenges. “I've looked, along with my caucus, at options to be able to try to do some kind of controlled expansion where you have a lot more flexibility,” Treat said. “The Healthy Adult Opportunity is the first time I've seen where the administration has really embraced concepts that allow more flexibility.” As the ballot measure was gaining support, Stitt and federal Medicaid officials began talking late last year about the block grant plan, which Verma had been developing for months at that point — and came as Stitt was growing more comfortable with the idea of adding people to the Medicaid rolls, said Carter Kimble, Oklahoma’s deputy secretary of health and mental health. “The more and more we learned about it, I think the more and more it appealed to the governor's business sense,” Kimble said. Verma is selling the plan as giving governors what they’ve been asking for: “The administration is offering states the upfront flexibility to design a program that works for their state’s unique needs, rather than being constrained by top-down dictates from Washington,” she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. Stitt earlier this month took the first steps toward Medicaid expansion, asking the Trump administration for permission to broaden the program by this summer. Review of the block grant plan will happen later. Supporters of the ballot question suspect that maneuver was meant to dampen voter enthusiasm for their measure, though Stitt’s office says it will help the state better prepare for his plan and bring federal cash to the state’s hospitals sooner. Earlier this week, not long after Stitt received national backlash for encouraging people to dine out as health experts were urgently warning people to avoid crowds, his Medicaid agency posted the formal block grant proposal. It would initially start as per-person payments based on program enrollment, rather than a lump sum block grant, as the state gathers data on new enrollees. The state hopes to switch to a block grant in two years. It’s now accepting public feedback over a 30-day period before it can submit the proposal to the federal government. Opponents of his plan have urged him to call it back while the nation addresses the pandemic. “Oklahomans have countless issues to address during this national health crisis; fighting for health care coverage should not be one of those issues,” said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the left-leaning Oklahoma Policy Institute. Stitt said there's no reason to delay, since state health officials are accepting comments on the plan online, by phone and mail. “A global health crisis is exactly the time we should be seeking to expand coverage for Oklahomans,” he said in a statement, though his administration has already asked CMS to expand Medicaid while it works on the block grant plan. Other red states are taking notice of Oklahoma’s plan. But none are rushing in just yet. Tennessee, which hasn’t expanded Medicaid, last fall submitted to Trump a proposal to block-grant much of its Medicaid program, which Verma has indicated won’t pass muster under the narrower guidelines put out this year. Arkansas, at the forefront of Medicaid expansion experiments the past decade, has a state law requiring it to pursue a block grant once the federal government authorizes them. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson has been noncommittal on whether the state would pursue Trump’s offer. “We’ve talked to the Trump administration on their guidelines for a block grant, and we’re seeing how we can uniquely make that work in Arkansas,” Hutchinson told POLITICO last month. “It’s a work in progress, it’s a big lift — but it’s something the states have asked for, and something I’ve asked for.” Even states supportive of the idea likely will want to take their time studying it. But there are also political considerations. The block grant offer would certainly be wiped away if Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders is elected president this fall. Also, Medicaid advocates are expected to challenge Oklahoma’s plan in court if it’s approved by the Trump administration, potentially entangling it in legal battles for years to come. Another one of Trump’s major Medicaid initiatives, the program’s first-ever work requirements, has stalled after courts found the administration didn’t have the authority to mandate that some enrollees work or volunteer to keep their coverage. Block grant critics say that Trump similarly doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally rewrite the rules for Medicaid financing. But if Trump gets a second term, he can continue his conservative transformation of the judiciary, increasing the odds that the courts, which have become more conservative with Trump appointees, may ultimately bless his Medicaid overhaul. In Missouri, Medicaid advocates are close to securing enough signatures to put Medicaid expansion on the ballot this year. Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who’s running for reelection and opposes Medicaid expansion, said he likes block grants but is waiting for the outcome of the ballot measure. In Kansas, Trump’s block grant announcement didn’t scramble a bipartisan deal to expand Medicaid reached weeks earlier, much to the surprise of the state’s Democratic governor. “When I saw that was coming out, I thought, ‘Oh this is going to throw a monkey wrench in here’ — but no,” Gov. Laura Kelly told POLITICO. Instead, expansion has been held up over an unrelated anti-abortion measure. A key driving force behind Medicaid expansion in Oklahoma and other conservative states that have pursued expansion has been the struggles of rural hospitals. Richard Gillespie knows about those all too well. More than three years ago, the 18-bed rural hospital he runs was in dire straits. The equipment at Jefferson County Hospital was antiquated. Doctors were in short supply, and admissions were declining. Gillespie already told one board member the hospital, the last in the town of 1,934 people, would need to close. Then a deal came through: a larger system 30 minutes away, Duncan Regional Hospital, was willing to lease it. “I thought I was going to cry, literally,” Gillespie recalled, as he sat next to Jay Johnson, Duncan’s president and CEO. The facility now has new equipment and more patients — and sports a “Keep Rural Hospitals Open” sign on its front door in support of the ballot initiative. But other rural hospitals haven’t been so fortunate. In addition to the six that have closed in Oklahoma since 2016, another eight have declared bankruptcy. Even a larger rural hospital like Duncan — the county’s second-largest employer and so much a fixture in the community that residents eat in its cafe after church on Sunday — has thin operating margins that make it difficult to grow and provide more care. State Rep. Marcus McEntire, whose district includes both Duncan and Jefferson hospitals, was the rare Oklahoma Republican to support Medicaid expansion when he ran for office in 2016. “We’ve had six or seven [hospitals] close — not saying that that’s all because we haven’t expanded Medicaid … but I am saying that it would have helped,” said McEntire, who helped lead a bipartisan health care task force that discussed Medicaid expansion in the legislature. Many of the state’s uninsured also turn to the state’s robust community health center network, which cares for 250,000 patients per year. Roughly 28 percent of them don’t have health coverage. “When you’re sitting at the dead last outcomes in the country, practically, you kind of have to say, ‘Gee, what are other states doing?’ and then steal some of those best ideas and put them together the way you’ll think they’ll work in Oklahoma,” said Lou Carmichael, CEO of Variety Care, which operates 14 clinics. Medicaid expansion supporters said there’s been a noticeable shift in the state’s attitude toward the program. “I’ve seen us go from, ‘Oh, hell no,’ to by the end of last year’s legislative session, I think the question was not, 'Should we expand Medicaid,' but 'How will we expand Medicaid?'” said Carly Putnam, policy director of the Oklahoma Policy Institute. The feeling isn’t universal. The conservative Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, which lost a lawsuit to strike the Medicaid expansion ballot question, contends the program won’t make a dent in the state’s underlying health problems, like high obesity rates and physical inactivity. “Medicaid expansion is not going to solve [that],” said Jonathan Small, the group’s president.",The state trying to turn Obamacare into Trumpcare,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/the-state-trying-to-turn-obamacare-into-trumpcare-139964,politico
"The coronavirus outbreak means a deep and sudden economic contraction is likely now upon us. Public authorities have two important priorities here. The first is stopping the spread as quickly as possible. The second should be to limit the economic damage as much as possible, minimizing hardships like mass unemployment, debt defaults, and corporate failures. Cash injections and other financial support from the government will be an important part of the response. Lawmakers are debating how to dispense money where it is most needed, whether that means loans to various industries hard hit by the pandemic, direct cash payments to American families, or the expansion of social safety net programs. Each requires large outlays of public expenditures, so part of the debate is how much of this public spending American taxpayers can bear over the long term.  However, there is a large source of potential cash that doesn’t have any of the challenges and problems of public spending: home equity. Americans collectively own homes worth nearly $30 trillion. They have mortgages on those homes totaling about $11 trillion. That leaves $19 trillion in home equity. In the decade since the financial crisis, Americans have been deleveraging and mortgages now only represent about 34 percent of the value of owned homes. The last time leverage was lower was 1991. In the response to the financial crisis, many new regulations and mandates were implemented in the mortgage origination process. Take for example, cash-out refinancing. Since the crisis, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration have all added rules that prevent borrowers from using a mortgage refinance to take out some extra cash if that will leave them with less than 20 percent equity in their homes. The new rules also require lenders to engage in time-consuming and expensive underwriting processes. They must prove to regulators that they are using new guidelines to make sure borrowers are qualified. And, if a borrower defaults, lenders are at risk of being punished by regulators in addition to bearing the normal costs of foreclosure. The effects of these new regulations on mortgage lending have been noticeable. Compare the first quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2019, periods that are largely similar in terms of the interest rate environment. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, during the first quarter of 2003, lenders originated $304 billion in new mortgages to borrowers with pristine credit scores above 760. In the fourth quarter of 2019, they originated $479 billion to borrowers with credit scores above 760 —an increase of 57 percent. Borrowers with the best credit never really reduced their borrowing activity during and after the crisis, and with the recent drop in interest rates, they are borrowing more than ever. Contrast this with borrowers with credit scores below 760. During the first quarter of 2003, they took out $665 billion in loans. In 2019, they only took out $273 billion —a decline of 59 percent. In other words, the people who are most likely to struggle in the coming months have less access to home lending resources than they did prior to the events that fed the financial crisis. The same is true when it comes to leveraging their own home equity. The New York Fed has also tracked a significant decline in home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). The value of HELOCs outstanding topped out at about $710 billion in 2009 and has declined nearly every quarter since then, to a current level of $390 billion. This suggests that there are many households that might want to either tactically refinance hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of mortgages or tap their home equity for cash, but have been prevented from doing so by the current set of regulatory hurdles. Certainly, the 2008 financial crisis has created some reasonable fear about mortgage lending. But the dangers that were present in 2008 are not present today. There aren’t millions of recently purchased homes in cities where prices have suddenly doubled in a short period of time. Most borrowers will be long-time homeowners who braved the worst housing market in nearly a century and managed to hold on. In other words, unlike the housing bubble, these borrowers won’t be naïve new buyers speculating on a frenzied market; they will be established homeowners seeking financial safety during a pandemic. If ever there was a time to suspend the post-crisis regulatory framework, that time is now. We should carve out an exception to the post-crisis mortgage regulations, at least temporarily. For the next three months — with an important caveat — banks should have the ability to offer customers a home equity line of credit or a cash-out refinance.  The caveat is that banks that make these loans should be required to hold them in their own portfolios. This ensures that they can’t pass the risk onto others, either the government or other investors. To make sure these mortgages are solid, banks should bear the risk themselves. Let them decide, solely with their own discretion, which loans they think are good risks. Let them perform underwriting on those loans like they would have for decades before the 2008 crisis, without all the time-consuming extra documentation they are required to file now. Call them “Coronavirus HELOCs.” There is no guarantee that large-scale public policy responses will get money to all the Americans who need it most. We can, however, provide a financial lifeline for many American homeowners by letting them decide for themselves if a refinancing or HELOC is a good option for them. Americans could tap their homes for a trillion dollars in home equity and still not be any more leveraged than they had been in the 1990s when the housing market was quite docile and without driving up the national debt. This would be a simple way to use the private sector to quickly infuse cash into local economies.",How Mortgages Can Ease the Downturn,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/21/how-mortgages-can-ease-the-downturn-140317,politico
"Barren streets, vacant offices and empty gyms. A quarantined small California town of 2,600, guarded by military officials. Rationing medical care. Government turf wars and bureaucratic battles.  All of these scenes unfolded on the screen before me—not on cable news television—but in a generation’s worth of Hollywood blockbusters and a six-part miniseries about viral epidemics.  On the first weekend of our national emergency, I self-quarantined inside my apartment. I socially distanced from hundreds of St. Patrick’s Day revelers who crowded inside a white party tent and listened to a blaring Bon Jovi cover band outside the Irish pub across the street below. Then, I binge-watched nearly 10 hours of virus entertainment, from 1995’s “Outbreak” to 2019’s “The Hot Zone.”  While I didn’t emerge as a postdoc epidemiologist, the lessons I took away, hidden in plain sight all these years, would be valuable to any member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. It’s all there, from Contagion’s advocacy for social distancing to Outbreak’s and Hot Zone’s depictions of how interagency squabbling can slow responses. Even the epigraph of “Outbreak,” from the Nobel laureate and bacteriologist Joshua Lederberg, should have focused us on the gravity of a pandemic earlier: “The single biggest threat to man’s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.” But I also noticed something else: These films have perhaps numbed us to those very viruses that threaten us most—the viruses that do not have a giant fatality rate or change our physical appearance. In “Outbreak,” Dustin Hoffman’s Col. Sam Daniels, a virologist with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, contends with Motaba, a fever-inducing virus that kills 100 percent of its patients in two to three days. In “The Hot Zone,” Ebola leaves its patients with a rash and kills them quickly. In “Contagion,” MEV-1 has a mortality rate around 20 percent. If Motaba had hit the U.S. the government would have been faster to quarantine cities and issue shelter-in-place orders, shutting down schools and non-essential businesses. Had Ebola been spreading around Indianapolis, I bet those revelers across the street would have stayed at home. But my neighbors seemed blind to COVID-19, which is more insidious and subtly dangerous than the diseases from the movies. Its mortality rate is in the single digits —low enough so many think they have little to fear—but it is proving just as disabling to the economy and our way of life, if not more, than much more deadly outbreaks, which can be contained faster.  Earlier this week, I asked Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist, why all of these movies hadn’t moved politicians and voters to take viral epidemics more seriously. “I don’t think movies change the way people feel about things,” he told me, adding that he was working with the writer of “Contagion,” Scott Z. Burns, on a public awareness campaign ad on the novel coronavirus.  “The fact that the United States has dodged the bullet with all of the latest infectious diseases, my perception of our government is that unless it’s screaming hot in the headlines, nothing will be done,” says Tracey McNamara, a technical consultant on “Contagion” and a veterinary medicine professor at Western University of Health Services, told me. “Contagion,” hints at our lackadaisical approach to any virus that isn’t produced in a Hollywood studio: There’s a scene in which a reporter asks Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Administrator Dr. Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne, whether the government is overreacting to a virus that would claim 26 million lives in 29 days.  “Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here, after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?” the reporter asks.  “I’d rather the news story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn’t do enough,” Cheever replies.  Set pieces and dramatic press conference scenes like this one seemed a critical part of any disaster movie. Now, we see them almost everyday when the coronavirus task force briefs the nation. For decades, these films have thrilled theatergoers with an invisible enemy, the stark reality of an apocalyptic human-versus-nature, us-versus-it conflict. But the actual conflict in all of these films is actually something different: It’s us versus the bureaucracy. These are not so much films about disasters as they are films about government.  “Contagion is such a compelling film—life is unfolding very much like the movie,” says McNamara, who discovered West Nile Virus in the summer of 1999 while working as the chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, when crows started falling from the sky and into exhibits that August. “The speed with which it spread. How it spread.” Turns out, Hollywood has been offering Washington clues about how a pandemic might transpire for decades—and what the government should do to fight it. Here are just a few: Much of “Outbreak” revolves around the efforts of the protagonist (Col. Sam Daniels, played by Dustin Hoffman) to convince his boss, Brigadier General William Ford (played by Morgan Freeman) that the country faces a real threat from the fictional Motaba virus. Daniels spends much of the film battling with Army General Donald McClintock, played by Donald Sutherland, to get the word out about the dangers of the virus.  After Daniels’ ex-wife, CDC staffer Dr. Roberta “Robby” Keough—played by Rene Russo—treats a dying and infected patient, she laments not getting a CDC advisory out about the virus faster. The CDC staffers’ efforts were blocked by her superiors. “I should’ve forced the alert,” the doctor says, explaining Motaba’s deadly effects. “Christ, Sam. I opened this guy up,” she tells her ex. “Looked like a bomb went off inside. His pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen—all the organs were liquified. Christ, I should’ve forced the alert.” In “Contagion,” weeks into the outbreak of MEV-1, Dr. Sanjay Gupta (played by himself) asks CDC Administrator Cheever how many people have died from the disease during a cable television appearance. The answer, Cheever admits, was “very difficult” to know exact numbers because reporting varied by state. “There are 50 different states in this country, which means there are 50 different health departments. Followed by 50 different protocols.” And in the final episode of “The Hot Zone,” a dispute between an Ebola researcher and the head of the CDC almost derails efforts to get to the bottom of the Reston, Virginia, Ebola outbreak.  “The guy hates my guts,” Walter said of the CDC official Trevor Rhodes (James D’Arcy). “I’m never going to convince him to help.”  “You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You got no choice.” The messages of all these films—infighting and turf battles make things worse—felt apt for the ongoing feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a branch of HHS that operates independently. “A series of incidents over the past 120 days suggest basic communication and coordination between CMS and HHS is lacking, thereby jeopardizing HHS’ mission and undermining public trust,” HHS chief information officer Jose Arrieta wrote a recent memo. The latest incident? On February 23, HHS’ email system crashed, causing vital messages about the emergency coronavirus funding package to be delayed for up to 11 hours. The cause: Verma’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had failed to brief HHS leaders about a test that would send thousands of messages through the system. The outage slowed the administration’s response to the deadly outbreak.  In the six-part National Geographic mini-series “The Hot Zone,” based on the 1994 non-fiction book by Richard Preston, Wade Carter, a fictionalized reclusive Ebola expert who studied the virus in the field, is frustrated that more senior officials aren’t taking the threat of Ebola on American soil more seriously. Carter tells Army Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies), a veterinarian who helped contain Ebola-infected monkeys from the Philippines: “Did I want this? Never. Now it’s here. Would it be good for the Oval Office to be pissing its pants about this now? You bet.”  But by the end of the series, after the scientists ultimately contained an Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, there seems to be little appetite from public policymakers to take the threat of an epidemic seriously. We see a flyover shot of Capitol Hill. In a nameless committee room, the deputy secretary of the National Institutes of Health asks Jaax: “So no one died?”  “That’s correct, Mr. Chairman,” Jaax says. “But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus.  “And 172 people were tested and came up negative,” the deputy secretary responded, unperturbed.  The warning was clear: When scientists are worried, people should listen. And yet, not more than a week ago, President Donald Trump and some Republican members of Congress, along with conservative television hosts, were saying that journalists and Democrats were overplaying the threat of the coronavirus. Now some of those pols who thought it was no big deal are getting tested for COVID-19 themselves.  In “The Hot Zone,” Jaax’s husband, Noah Emmerich’s Lt. Col. Jerry Jaax, makes a plea: “It’s no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development”—meaning that the CDC was caught somewhat flat-footed by the outbreak in Reston.  But back in real life, just last week, even as coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought defended the Trump administration’s proposed $35 million cut to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, designed for use by the CDC.  Rep. Matt Cartwright, the Democratic member from Pennsylvania, bristled at the cuts in a hearing with Vought. “The question is today, as we sit here and we know about coronavirus and the impact it’s taking on the people of the world and the economies of the world and the stock market and everything, as you sit here today, are you ready to take that back?” In none of the virus movies I watched do we see the U.S. president. He or she is often one of the least important characters. In “Contagion,” he’s moved underground. In “Outbreak,” we only see the chief of staff, talking White House officials through the ethics of bombing a California town, executing all of its citizens in order to contain Mataba. Instead, the most important characters—the ones who do the talking—are the public health officials, virologists, researchers and frontline healthcare workers. In the movies, scientists always offer a clear explanation and as much information as they have to concerned citizens. Politicians would only get in the way. President Donald Trump didn’t get the memo. His statements about coronavirus have been perplexing and counterproductive. He said we have it “under control.” He compared it to the flu. He told people with the virus to go to work. He suggested the virus would “disappear.” Then he declared a national emergency. In contrast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a global health official at the State Department who is now White House coronavirus response coordinator, are lucid, calm presenters of information—perhaps the administration’s most credible spokespeople. If this were a Hollywood movie, those two would have been doing most of the talking from the beginning.  Bryan Cranston, who plays Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in “Contagion,” alludes to a congressman who is at risk of infecting his fellow members of Congress with MEV-1. “There’s a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.,” Haggerty says. “He was in Chicago over the holiday. They are using the pod to fly him home, and then they are closing Midway and O’Hare. The governor there is calling out the national guard. They are setting up roadblocks. They are shutting down the board of trade, public transportation. Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.”  Any policymaker who watched that scene and connected the dots wouldn’t have been able to escape the realization that in the event of a pandemic, it would be important for Congress to have a way of working remotely. This week, several representatives and senators directed some staffers to work from home. Still, members of Congress, many of whom are at risk of higher mortality rates given their average age—57.8 years in the House and 61.8 years in the Senate— don’t have an established way to conduct their business remotely. The Wolfgang Petersen film “Outbreak” is perhaps the least subtle of the group of films. A lab clinician infected with Motaba sees a movie with his girlfriend. As a result, the entire town of Cedar Creek, California—population 2,600—is nearly bombed with the “the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal” by the U.S. government to contain the spread of the virus.  When Daniels and Keough survey the infected at a makeshift hospital in Cedar Creek, Keough remarks: “So many—so fast.”  “Apparently they all gathered at a movie theater,” Daniels replies.  In “Contagion,” the CDC administrator urges social distancing and not shaking hands as the best advice for controlling the spread of MEV-1. We see empty gyms and open-floor plan offices. “Right now, our best defense has been social distancing,” Fishburne’s Cheever, the CDC director, tells Dr. Sanjay Gutpa in a cable television studio. “No handshaking. Staying home when you are sick. Washing your hands frequently.”  The idea for the scene came from Lipkin, the Columbia University epidemiologist who told the film’s writer, Scott Z. Burns, that he would serve as a technical adviser on the movie if he agreed to make it as scientifically accurate a film as possible.  In the film’s emotional denouement, Cheever visits the home of one the CDC’s janitors to deliver a vaccine, where he explains to the janitor’s son the origins of the handshake. (The scene was “designed” to disclose the history of the handshake,” Lipkin told me in an interview earlier this week.  “Do you know where this comes from? Shaking hands?” he asks the boy, after delivering the vaccine by pushing a swab up his nostril. “It was a way of showing a stranger you weren’t carrying a weapon in the old days.”  These days, we are all presumed to be armed and dangerous.",What I Learned About Coronavirus From Binge-watching 10 Hours of Virus Movies,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/21/pandemic-movies-coronavirus-140043,politico
"David Zuckerman, the lieutenant governor of Vermont, is an eccentric longtime figure in state politics — a ponytail-sporting organic farmer and Bernie Sanders protege who has proudly fought against government-mandated vaccinations.  But the arrival of the coronavirus has suddenly put Zuckerman on the defensive in his campaign for governor this year: Amid the worsening pandemic, one of his top Democratic opponents is calling out his anti-vaxxer views as dangerous, and attempting to make them politically toxic. “In moments like this, we see just how critical it is that we support vaccines and make them as available as possible,” said Rebecca Holcombe, the state’s former education secretary who is challenging Zuckerman for the Democratic nomination in the August primary to take on popular Republican incumbent Gov. Phil Scott. “It's scary that anyone in public office or seeking public office would cast doubt about the value of vaccines. It's unbelievable this is even up for debate."" Zuckerman shot back that Holcombe is trying to use a public health crisis to score political points. “The fact that any political campaign is trying to use this moment for political opportunism is unconscionable,” he told POLITICO. “Right now, my primary focus is to disseminate important health information about the virus and how to keep Vermonters, their families and our community safe...When the COVID-19 vaccine is available for the coronavirus it should be free for all and universally accessible.” The fight in Vermont’s Democratic gubernatorial primary sets up a larger test of how mainstream the “anti-vaxxer” movement has become on the left, and whether the coronavirus pandemic could make it politically untenable even in liberal bastions. Anti-vaccine advocacy is a growing force in American politics and around the globe as formerly fringe activists have developed a wide reach across social media platforms. Other candidates who oppose mandatory vaccinations are running for office, and some are winning, with support from large and well-funded advocacy groups.  Recently-ousted Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin has said that mandatory vaccines are un-American. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has repeatedly said parents should be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children. With backing by the group Texans for Vaccine Choice as well as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, libertarian Susanna Dokupil is making another run for the state legislature, primarying one of the most vocally pro-vaccine Republicans in Austin.  But the movement has had even more success in blocking pro-vaccine legislation, defeating efforts in New Jersey, California and other states that would have eliminated exemptions to immunization. Zuckerman, 48, has faced fierce criticism from Republican opponents in past races for his position on vaccinations, yet still won. He is seen as the frontrunner in an August primary for the Democratic nomination, though Scott is favored to win reelection. But Holcombe is betting that the anxiety surrounding coronavirus will make the issue more salient and perhaps will force a reckoning with the anti-vaxx left. That movement includes several high-profile celebrities along with former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, a vocal skeptic of mandatory vaccinations, campaigned for Sanders after she dropped out of the race. Last year, the World Health Organization labeled what it called “vaccine hesitancy” one of the top 10 threats to global health, citing a 30% increase in measles cases worldwide. Vaccine skepticism is often tied to populist political movements on the right and the left. It’s part of a bigger surge of anti-establishment anger around the world — including in the U.S., where less than half the population gets vaccinated against the seasonal flu, which has killed tens of thousands in the past year alone. Despite past blowback for his positions, Zuckerman has remained firm in his opposition to mandatory vaccinations. He was called a “hero” by the co-founder of a Vermont “vaccine choice” group during his 2016 bid for lieutenant governor. In 2015, while serving in the state Senate, Zuckerman strongly opposed a bill that repealed the “philosophical exemption” to vaccinations which ultimately passed. And in a 2018 debate while running for reelection, he defended his past positions by arguing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has financial connections with the pharmaceutical industry that made him skeptical of its recommendations. “The CDC’s infectious disease control board actually has a number of conflicts of interests,” he argued. “And so yes, like many, I do sometimes question when government agencies are a bit too infused with corporate influence with respect to some of the outcomes and decisions they make.”  Yet Zuckerman has thrived politically, and some Vermont Democratic officials speculate he could someday succeed Sanders, a longtime ally, in the Senate. Sanders’ presidential campaign declined to comment on Zuckerman, but one aide noted that Sanders supports mandatory vaccinations with ""very limited exceptions.” The aide said “there are some health exceptions“ but declined to provide further details on which exceptions he supports. Many in the so-called “anti-vaxxer” community have tried in recent years to make their position more politically palatable by arguing that while they believe vaccines are effective, they are opposed to the government requiring them. Zuckerman has taken a similar messaging approach. In the 2018 debate, Zuckerman said “the science behind vaccines is sound, I think vaccines do good for our communities, my daughter is vaccinated. But it’s a question of whether government should be forcing that onto individuals.” Public health experts say such arguments put vulnerable people at risk. Even before the recent coronavirus pandemic, several states had been moving to eliminate religious and other exemptions for childhood vaccinations, as measles and other diseases have resurged in recent years.  “That's a dangerous message, that everyone should decide for themselves,” said Lois Privor-Dumm, a senior researcher on global vaccine policy at Johns Hopkins University. “If [people who forego vaccines] want to keep themselves quarantined all the time, that’s one thing. But that’s not what happens in life. So it's not appropriate for candidates to go against all the public health experts out there.” While campaigning in 2016 the Republican primary, Donald Trump also argued without evidence there is a correlation between vaccines and autism, a position which drew rebuke from the medical and scientific community as well as fellow candidate Ben Carson, a brain surgeon who now serves as his secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  As president, however, Trump shifted his position. In response to a number of Measles outbreaks in 2019, Trump told parents that their children “have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important.”",Anti-vaxx politicians under fire as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/anti-vaccine-coronavirus-137446,politico
"Joe Biden reached a new and heady milestone when he shellacked Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona to become the de facto Democratic nominee for president. But there was no soaring speech to acknowledge the moment. He never took the stage amid a sea of Biden signs or before an adoring crowd on national television. Biden was instead stuck in a makeshift studio in his Delaware home, webcasting his remarks with a low-quality personal computer camera against a straight-out-of-YouTube black backdrop and two American flags. He warned about the coronavirus contagion. He offered an olive branch to Bernie Sanders. Then, despite two consecutive weeks of smashing victories, he all but disappeared from the news cycle for days. The moment was a perfect distillation of Biden’s current predicament — in a state of suspended political animation, trapped between a rival who refuses to quit and the global pandemic that has all but shut down the Democratic primary campaign. Because Sanders won’t quit, Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. A source familiar with the Democratic National Committee’s discussions says the party offered both the Biden and Sanders campaigns the opportunity to open joint-fundraising accounts. But since Sanders declined, the party is reluctant to enter into one with Biden because of the bad optics of seeming to help one candidate. “That’s going to eventually hurt Biden with financing if the DNC doesn’t go ahead with this,” the source said. Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also can’t meet with donors at fundraisers — which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy that’s sinking into recession or perhaps worse. “It’s a tough position,” said Matt Littman, who’s hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software. “It’s harder to raise money when there’s no face-to-face meeting and personal contact,” Littman said. “And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I can’t count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.” For the foreseeable future, all live campaign events are canceled, so he can’t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked. His ability to criticize Trump on anything other than his performance on coronavirus response and preparedness is constrained by the emergency-like conditions. As new polling suggests that Trump’s approval for responding to the virus is improving, some of Biden’s fellow Democrats worry he’s paralyzed himself. “Biden is only in limbo if he keeps himself there. He’s only in a predicament to the degree he chooses to view himself in one,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran of progressive politics who is head of the Revolving Door Project, which watchdogs executive branch appointees. “Joe Biden can either complain about the fact that he is not getting significant media coverage or he could do something to change that,” Hauser said. “He needs to offer an alternative and offer a running play-by-play critique of the failings of this administration.” Biden aides and allies, however, are projecting an aura of calm, saying Trump’s false claims and reinvented history about the virus will haunt him on their own as the economy craters. The former vice president pledged to call him out on it by Monday — but made the statement via conference call Friday with reporters instead of on camera. Meanwhile, his staff is scattered, communicating via teleconferencing, email and conference call. Some remain holed up in Philadelphia apartments near campaign headquarters but others went home to Washington. A few are near the candidate in Wilmington, Delaware. Another is in the mountains of Puerto Rico. The headquarters and campaign trail now run through Biden’s living room as his staff scrambles to increase his social media outreach to compensate for the social distancing. The first step: installing a better video camera in Biden’s house, which will soon have broadcast-ready capabilities and high-quality livestreaming software. To limit the risk of infecting the candidate, the number of staffers is limited within the house. The campaign also plans to flood social media with Biden to promote the brand of the former vice president who helped lead the nation’s Ebola virus response, has a vast knowledge of domestic and foreign policy and is known both as comforter-in-chief as well as the ice-cream-eating, aviator-shade-wearing everyman parodied in The Onion. “The thing that’s good about Joe Biden and the way the internet thinks about him is that there is a sense of brand, people know him as vice president, and they know ice cream and aviators. For us, we have to evolve from ice cream and aviators and being vice president to being commander-in-chief, while remaining relatable and true to his personality. That's the balance,” said Rob Flaherty, Biden’s digital director. “Our digital operation is putting out five-minute Iran crisis explainers and koozies that say, ‘keep it cool kid.’ It’s always been this tension,” Flaherty said. “And for us, the challenge and the opportunity is how we keep it between the buoys and present the best image of Joe Biden.” To increase voters’ sense of intimacy with Biden — who revels in one-on-one time with voters after public events — the campaign is discussing ways to find the technology and invent a “virtual rope-line” in which voters would wait in an electronic “queue” to speak with him briefly face-to-face, albeit via livestream. The campaign is also planning to hold more tele-town halls and is discussing a Biden podcast, in addition to pumping out more video clips of him. In some ways, the Biden campaign wants to give followers and viewers a sense of Biden as if he were a character in a reality show, building a loyal following online similar to the way former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s campaign did. Flaherty, who was O’Rourke’s digital director, said Biden’s social media presence will be unique to him. So unlike O’Rourke, Biden won’t be livestreaming from the dentist office chair or skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot. Flaherty said the campaign always planned to have a heavy social-media focus. The only major difference now is the campaign is completely online and it has to ramp up faster and on a bigger scale. From the start, the campaign was designed to limit the news media’s interactions with Biden due to his reputation for gaffes and going off-script, which in some ways makes Biden’s social distancing a boon — his campaign can more tightly control his image. Rallies, after all, are only a small part of a campaign, said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager. “The vast majority of voters don't interact with campaigns by attending rallies. They experience the campaign through TV coverage, social media, and advertising, and contact from volunteers, all of which will still continue,” Mook said. “This isn't the end of the campaign trail, but rather it's full transition into the digital space.” But the Biden campaign knows that time is precious. Trump’s campaign is preparing to unload on Biden to negatively define him before he’s the nominee and consolidates his base, which is harder now with Sanders still hanging around. Trump already has a far-bigger social media following, presence and reach than Biden. “With respect to the Trump camp — the entire right in general — they’re all rallying against one candidate: Biden. It’s so concentrated. But on the left, it’s still pretty fractured,” said Glenn Parham, founder of the Republican political intelligence firm Pundit Analytics. “The left is starting to funnel into Biden, but a lot of different advocacy groups are running attack ads against Joe and are supporting other candidates, even ones that have dropped out, which is kind of absurd.”  On the right, he said, the volume and concentrated fire “are orders of magnitude greater than on the left.” While Trump is more negatively affected on the campaign trail by coronavirus than Biden — the president’s campaign revolves around his big rallies — he has been able to occupy center stage by giving a daily White House press briefing. Joe Lockhart, former White House spokesman for the Clinton administration, said Biden needs to carefully calibrate his response to Trump. “It’s very tricky. When you’re in a crisis, there can only be one president. Just attacking him every day is a bad strategy,” said Lockhart, anticipating the Trump campaign’s response leveled Friday at Biden. “Where I think Biden is going is if he gives a series of strategic speeches that talk about the importance of preparing, the importance of government pulling together and the importance of being straight with the American public,” Lockhart said. Steve Schale, leader of the pro-Biden super PAC Unite The Country, said voters might still want an abeyance in the appearance of politicking in a time of crisis, at least in the short term. Schale said he was supposed to be on the road this week raising money from donors — a task made easier by Biden’s emergence as the all-but-certain nominee. But he’s stuck at home along with nearly everyone else. “This is affecting everyone’s lives in ways we didn’t imagine, not just Biden,” Schale said. “There’s no playbook for this.”",‘There’s no playbook for this’: Biden trapped in campaign limbo,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coranavirus-puts-biden-in-limbo-138726,politico
"The United Nations Security Council, a premier global forum, hasn’t yet held a session on the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world. The European Union is trying to limit exports of key medical supplies to nations beyond its borders — while its own members are barely helping one another.  Financial institutions worldwide have only recently started cooperating to mitigate the economic damage from the rapidly spreading illness, but investors are still spooked.  And, the United States, led by President Donald Trump and his America First vision, is focused more on the virus’ internal challenge than its global impact. Instead of rallying the world, as it has in the past on major challenges, the U.S. is brawling with other countries affected by the crisis.  If there’s one thing the coronavirus has shown, it’s that a crisis that affects all of humanity does not necessarily inspire international unity, coordination or leadership. Instead, borders are closing, competition for resources is up, politicians are insulting one another, and no country is taking charge.  “This is a challenge that’s hitting every country at the same time, and we’re all working in our own little silos instead of working together,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former Obama administration official who oversaw disaster response. “There’s no attempt at global leadership from anyone right now, and we’re not going to win if ultimately we’re not working together on this.”  The difference in reaction is particularly stark when compared to the Ebola virus crisis, which — while more limited in geographical scope — nonetheless inspired a global response spearheaded by the U.S. under then-President Barack Obama.  As of Friday, the coronavirus had been spotted in over 150 countries, with more than 255,000 confirmed cases and over 10,000 deaths, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.  That number has grown quickly in recent weeks as Western officials have struggled to absorb the hard-won lessons of their counterparts in Asia, where draconian measures — in the case of China, which shut down entire regions — and more innovative tactics in Singapore and South Korea have beaten back the disease.  As the outbreak's center of gravity shifts to Europe and North America, the deadly illness is straining health care systems, as well as supply lines for medicines, ventilators and other critical items. It is shocking economies as governments close their borders, order quarantines and enact severe “social distancing” measures that are devastating retail businesses and roiling markets.  Instead of uniting, world powers are squabbling. On Friday, the White House circulated a video of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing Russia, China, Iran and others of spreading disinformation about the virus. Perhaps most glaringly, there’s been no significant international gathering of political leaders tasked with devising a global strategy to tackle the disease.  The closest thing to it came earlier this week when the leaders of countries in the Group of Seven — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — held a video conference call on the virus.  The discussion reportedly took place at the urging of France’s President Emmanuel Macron. It yielded notable commitments, including pledges to work together on research and a vague promise to “coordinate our efforts to delay the spread of the virus, including through appropriate border management measures.”  But Trump has barely mentioned the call since. His earlier, sudden decision to impose a travel ban on Europe due to the virus had already surprised and upset key G-7 members, who complained that they had not been consulted. And seeing as the G-7 does not include major affected countries, such as China, its commitments — if carried out — will arguably have limited effect. (The G-7’s foreign ministers are due to hold a virtual meeting next week.)  Saudi Arabia has called for an emergency virtual summit next week of the leaders of the Group of 20, which does include China. But as of Friday, it was unclear when — or if — that session would happen. Saudi Arabia currently holds the group’s presidency, but its recent precipitous moves to slash oil prices have not helped soothe financial markets.  During a White House news conference Friday, Pompeo, who has kept an unusually low profile throughout the crisis, praised “the global leadership that America has always delivered” and claimed it “has been great to see countries around the world rally behind what we are doing.”  Pressed for examples, a senior Trump administration official pointed to U.S. plans to spend more than $1 billion to help the international community fight the pandemic.  The official added that the administration “has conducted numerous conference calls with science ministers from around the world, leading to actions on data sharing, clinical trials, enhanced access to data and research publications, and unity among the international science community.”  China’s communist leaders have taken perhaps the most visible moves aimed at burnishing their global credentials during the crisis.  Scientists believe the infectious disease emerged in China’s Hubei province last year. For weeks, the Chinese downplayed the disease, muzzling doctors and resisting allowing in a team from the World Health Organization. Eventually, Beijing used extreme means to limit the spread of the illness, and the country claims to have brought it under control.  In recent days, China has sent supplies and experts to other countries fighting the illness. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has taken a high profile amid the sudden Chinese generosity, and his state-controlled media machine has promoted China’s authoritarian governance model as best suited for dealing with such an enemy. Still, there are signs that China is reluctant to take too bold a stance. For one thing, China currently holds the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, and yet it has not convened a session on the coronavirus.  When asked why the Security Council hasn’t met to discuss the pandemic, a senior U.N. diplomat told POLITICO: “They just haven’t,” adding, “We’re able to support them either virtually or even if they want to meet in person.”  Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  While rare, holding a U.N. Security Council session on a health crisis is not without precedent; one was held on the Ebola crisis.  One possible reason no Security Council session has been called this time is the ongoing war of words over the virus between China and another permanent, veto-wielding member: the United States.  Chinese officials have been floating conspiracy theories alleging that the coronavirus may have originated outside their borders, possibly even at the hands of the U.S. military.  In response, Trump, Pompeo and some Republican lawmakers have been calling the illness the “Chinese virus” or similar terms, angering Beijing. U.S. officials also keep hammering China for its original lack of candor about the seriousness of the outbreak, though Trump has praised Xi personally for his handling of it.  At times, Trump has even appeared to welcome the pandemic’s rapidly mounting consequences for the world order, claiming he was happy to see Americans stay home and buy their goods from U.S. factories. There are few signs, however, that he is deeply engaged with cajoling or negotiating with other leaders to coordinate their plans for combating the virus.  At the United Nations, the main organization involved in a global response to the virus is the WHO. On other U.N. fronts, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are trying to help relief groups navigate the viral terrain as they aid vulnerable populations such as refugees.  But these are largely technical bodies, not ones that can hammer out political agreements — or at least guidelines — on issues like medical supply lines, financial assistance and border policies.  When countries have come to agreements related to the virus, it’s often been bilateral — such as the Canada-U.S. decision to limit border crossings — or through regional blocs, such as the EU.  Those agreements, however, could have negative impacts elsewhere on Earth.  In Europe, countries have been hoarding medical supplies, with some putting up restrictions on exports of items such as face masks. The EU stepped in, announcing limits on exports of such materials outside the bloc in an effort to boost availability within.  Researchers are warning, however, that those new external limits could hurt other, poorer countries that need Europe to supply such equipment. Europe’s move could also prompt nations outside the bloc to restrict their exports of materials European nations will require.  G-7 finance ministers and central bankers pledged on March 3 to use “all appropriate policy tools” to keep their economies afloat. But stock markets continued to fall, and financial institutions across the world have begun stepping up their actions in recent days.  Several central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have taken what appear to be coordinated actions to stabilize the markets, such as buying bonds, cutting interest rates and re-opening emergency lending programs last used during the financial crisis of 2008.  The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said earlier this month that they “stand ready to help our member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by the COVID-19 virus.”  But such financial promises also run into political realities, such as whether the IMF should lend funds to Venezuela, Iran and other countries whose regimes are opposed by the United States, a major global financial player.  Former U.S. officials and analysts who watch multilateral institutions note that the coronavirus is simply unprecedented in its geographical scope and the resulting implications. The virus, officially called COVID-19, is a new strain that scientists are still trying to understand, and it has even stricken some government officials who would be involved in planning a response.  “Who can muster an international response when no one can travel, when countries are in lockdown? Even within countries you can’t travel,” one former senior State Department official said.  They note, however, that there’s one past model that offers some lessons: The U.S.-led response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. That crisis began in the early months of 2014, with an outbreak in Guinea. Over the next several months, cases appeared in neighboring countries. The WHO stepped in to help, with assistance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In August, as global concern grew over the vicious illness, Obama used a gathering of African leaders in the United States to raise awareness of the crisis and pledge continued U.S. support. By mid-September, Obama announced that, among other measures, the U.S. would send 3,000 troops to West Africa to help build medical facilities and offer other aid to medical professionals. Obama seemed aware of criticism that he’d moved too slowly, saying, “We have to act fast — we can’t dawdle on this one” and adding that “this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response.”  That same week, the U.N. Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution declaring Ebola a threat to world peace and security. The meeting was led by the United States, which held the Security Council’s rotating presidency at the time. U.N. observers said it was a rare, possibly unprecedented council session due to its focus on a public health crisis.  Days later, during the annual gathering of the U.N. General Assembly, a special high-level meeting was held on the issue of the Ebola virus. Speaking to those gathered, Obama warned that the global community was “not doing enough.”  In the ensuing weeks and months, other countries joined or stepped up efforts to help West African states contain the illness. Although some Republicans insisted Obama fumbled the response (and Trump was a critic, too), the former Democratic president’s aides defend his approach.  With the coronavirus, “there’s been a complete absence of anything like that,” said Konyndyk, who helped lead the Ebola response under Obama. “Our diplomatic toolbox is more absent despite the fact that it’s more necessary.”  Among those arguing for a more united international front against the coronavirus is U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  In what his office dubbed a “virtual press encounter” Thursday, Guterres called on world leaders to “come together and offer an urgent and coordinated response to this global crisis.”  “Current responses at the country level will not address the global scale and complexity of the crisis,” he warned.",World leaders are fighting the virus.

"Barren streets, vacant offices and empty gyms. A quarantined small California town of 2,600, guarded by military officials. Rationing medical care. Government turf wars and bureaucratic battles.  All of these scenes unfolded on the screen before me—not on cable news television—but in a generation’s worth of Hollywood blockbusters and a six-part miniseries about viral epidemics.  On the first weekend of our national emergency, I self-quarantined inside my apartment. I socially distanced from hundreds of St. Patrick’s Day revelers who crowded inside a white party tent and listened to a blaring Bon Jovi cover band outside the Irish pub across the street below. Then, I binge-watched nearly 10 hours of virus entertainment, from 1995’s “Outbreak” to 2019’s “The Hot Zone.”  While I didn’t emerge as a postdoc epidemiologist, the lessons I took away, hidden in plain sight all these years, would be valuable to any member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. It’s all there, from Contagion’s advocacy for social distancing to Outbreak’s and Hot Zone’s depictions of how interagency squabbling can slow responses. Even the epigraph of “Outbreak,” from the Nobel laureate and bacteriologist Joshua Lederberg, should have focused us on the gravity of a pandemic earlier: “The single biggest threat to man’s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.” But I also noticed something else: These films have perhaps numbed us to those very viruses that threaten us most—the viruses that do not have a giant fatality rate or change our physical appearance. In “Outbreak,” Dustin Hoffman’s Col. Sam Daniels, a virologist with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, contends with Motaba, a fever-inducing virus that kills 100 percent of its patients in two to three days. In “The Hot Zone,” Ebola leaves its patients with a rash and kills them quickly. In “Contagion,” MEV-1 has a mortality rate around 20 percent. If Motaba had hit the U.S. the government would have been faster to quarantine cities and issue shelter-in-place orders, shutting down schools and non-essential businesses. Had Ebola been spreading around Indianapolis, I bet those revelers across the street would have stayed at home. But my neighbors seemed blind to COVID-19, which is more insidious and subtly dangerous than the diseases from the movies. Its mortality rate is in the single digits —low enough so many think they have little to fear—but it is proving just as disabling to the economy and our way of life, if not more, than much more deadly outbreaks, which can be contained faster.  Earlier this week, I asked Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist, why all of these movies hadn’t moved politicians and voters to take viral epidemics more seriously. “I don’t think movies change the way people feel about things,” he told me, adding that he was working with the writer of “Contagion,” Scott Z. Burns, on a public awareness campaign ad on the novel coronavirus.  “The fact that the United States has dodged the bullet with all of the latest infectious diseases, my perception of our government is that unless it’s screaming hot in the headlines, nothing will be done,” says Tracey McNamara, a technical consultant on “Contagion” and a veterinary medicine professor at Western University of Health Services, told me. “Contagion,” hints at our lackadaisical approach to any virus that isn’t produced in a Hollywood studio: There’s a scene in which a reporter asks Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Administrator Dr. Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne, whether the government is overreacting to a virus that would claim 26 million lives in 29 days.  “Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here, after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?” the reporter asks.  “I’d rather the news story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn’t do enough,” Cheever replies.  Set pieces and dramatic press conference scenes like this one seemed a critical part of any disaster movie. Now, we see them almost everyday when the coronavirus task force briefs the nation. For decades, these films have thrilled theatergoers with an invisible enemy, the stark reality of an apocalyptic human-versus-nature, us-versus-it conflict. But the actual conflict in all of these films is actually something different: It’s us versus the bureaucracy. These are not so much films about disasters as they are films about government.  “Contagion is such a compelling film—life is unfolding very much like the movie,” says McNamara, who discovered West Nile Virus in the summer of 1999 while working as the chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, when crows started falling from the sky and into exhibits that August. “The speed with which it spread. How it spread.” Turns out, Hollywood has been offering Washington clues about how a pandemic might transpire for decades—and what the government should do to fight it. Here are just a few: Much of “Outbreak” revolves around the efforts of the protagonist (Col. Sam Daniels, played by Dustin Hoffman) to convince his boss, Brigadier General William Ford (played by Morgan Freeman) that the country faces a real threat from the fictional Motaba virus. Daniels spends much of the film battling with Army General Donald McClintock, played by Donald Sutherland, to get the word out about the dangers of the virus.  After Daniels’ ex-wife, CDC staffer Dr. Roberta “Robby” Keough—played by Rene Russo—treats a dying and infected patient, she laments not getting a CDC advisory out about the virus faster. The CDC staffers’ efforts were blocked by her superiors. “I should’ve forced the alert,” the doctor says, explaining Motaba’s deadly effects. “Christ, Sam. I opened this guy up,” she tells her ex. “Looked like a bomb went off inside. His pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen—all the organs were liquified. Christ, I should’ve forced the alert.” In “Contagion,” weeks into the outbreak of MEV-1, Dr. Sanjay Gupta (played by himself) asks CDC Administrator Cheever how many people have died from the disease during a cable television appearance. The answer, Cheever admits, was “very difficult” to know exact numbers because reporting varied by state. “There are 50 different states in this country, which means there are 50 different health departments. Followed by 50 different protocols.” And in the final episode of “The Hot Zone,” a dispute between an Ebola researcher and the head of the CDC almost derails efforts to get to the bottom of the Reston, Virginia, Ebola outbreak.  “The guy hates my guts,” Walter said of the CDC official Trevor Rhodes (James D’Arcy). “I’m never going to convince him to help.”  “You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You got no choice.” The messages of all these films—infighting and turf battles make things worse—felt apt for the ongoing feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a branch of HHS that operates independently. “A series of incidents over the past 120 days suggest basic communication and coordination between CMS and HHS is lacking, thereby jeopardizing HHS’ mission and undermining public trust,” HHS chief information officer Jose Arrieta wrote a recent memo. The latest incident? On February 23, HHS’ email system crashed, causing vital messages about the emergency coronavirus funding package to be delayed for up to 11 hours. The cause: Verma’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had failed to brief HHS leaders about a test that would send thousands of messages through the system. The outage slowed the administration’s response to the deadly outbreak.  In the six-part National Geographic mini-series “The Hot Zone,” based on the 1994 non-fiction book by Richard Preston, Wade Carter, a fictionalized reclusive Ebola expert who studied the virus in the field, is frustrated that more senior officials aren’t taking the threat of Ebola on American soil more seriously. Carter tells Army Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies), a veterinarian who helped contain Ebola-infected monkeys from the Philippines: “Did I want this? Never. Now it’s here. Would it be good for the Oval Office to be pissing its pants about this now? You bet.”  But by the end of the series, after the scientists ultimately contained an Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, there seems to be little appetite from public policymakers to take the threat of an epidemic seriously. We see a flyover shot of Capitol Hill. In a nameless committee room, the deputy secretary of the National Institutes of Health asks Jaax: “So no one died?”  “That’s correct, Mr. Chairman,” Jaax says. “But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus.  “And 172 people were tested and came up negative,” the deputy secretary responded, unperturbed.  The warning was clear: When scientists are worried, people should listen. And yet, not more than a week ago, President Donald Trump and some Republican members of Congress, along with conservative television hosts, were saying that journalists and Democrats were overplaying the threat of the coronavirus. Now some of those pols who thought it was no big deal are getting tested for COVID-19 themselves.  In “The Hot Zone,” Jaax’s husband, Noah Emmerich’s Lt. Col. Jerry Jaax, makes a plea: “It’s no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development”—meaning that the CDC was caught somewhat flat-footed by the outbreak in Reston.  But back in real life, just last week, even as coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought defended the Trump administration’s proposed $35 million cut to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, designed for use by the CDC.  Rep. Matt Cartwright, the Democratic member from Pennsylvania, bristled at the cuts in a hearing with Vought. “The question is today, as we sit here and we know about coronavirus and the impact it’s taking on the people of the world and the economies of the world and the stock market and everything, as you sit here today, are you ready to take that back?” In none of the virus movies I watched do we see the U.S. president. He or she is often one of the least important characters. In “Contagion,” he’s moved underground. In “Outbreak,” we only see the chief of staff, talking White House officials through the ethics of bombing a California town, executing all of its citizens in order to contain Mataba. Instead, the most important characters—the ones who do the talking—are the public health officials, virologists, researchers and frontline healthcare workers. In the movies, scientists always offer a clear explanation and as much information as they have to concerned citizens. Politicians would only get in the way. President Donald Trump didn’t get the memo. His statements about coronavirus have been perplexing and counterproductive. He said we have it “under control.” He compared it to the flu. He told people with the virus to go to work. He suggested the virus would “disappear.” Then he declared a national emergency. In contrast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a global health official at the State Department who is now White House coronavirus response coordinator, are lucid, calm presenters of information—perhaps the administration’s most credible spokespeople. If this were a Hollywood movie, those two would have been doing most of the talking from the beginning.  Bryan Cranston, who plays Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in “Contagion,” alludes to a congressman who is at risk of infecting his fellow members of Congress with MEV-1. “There’s a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.,” Haggerty says. “He was in Chicago over the holiday. They are using the pod to fly him home, and then they are closing Midway and O’Hare. The governor there is calling out the national guard. They are setting up roadblocks. They are shutting down the board of trade, public transportation. Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.”  Any policymaker who watched that scene and connected the dots wouldn’t have been able to escape the realization that in the event of a pandemic, it would be important for Congress to have a way of working remotely. This week, several representatives and senators directed some staffers to work from home. Still, members of Congress, many of whom are at risk of higher mortality rates given their average age—57.8 years in the House and 61.8 years in the Senate— don’t have an established way to conduct their business remotely. The Wolfgang Petersen film “Outbreak” is perhaps the least subtle of the group of films. A lab clinician infected with Motaba sees a movie with his girlfriend. As a result, the entire town of Cedar Creek, California—population 2,600—is nearly bombed with the “the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal” by the U.S. government to contain the spread of the virus.  When Daniels and Keough survey the infected at a makeshift hospital in Cedar Creek, Keough remarks: “So many—so fast.”  “Apparently they all gathered at a movie theater,” Daniels replies.  In “Contagion,” the CDC administrator urges social distancing and not shaking hands as the best advice for controlling the spread of MEV-1. We see empty gyms and open-floor plan offices. “Right now, our best defense has been social distancing,” Fishburne’s Cheever, the CDC director, tells Dr. Sanjay Gutpa in a cable television studio. “No handshaking. Staying home when you are sick. Washing your hands frequently.”  The idea for the scene came from Lipkin, the Columbia University epidemiologist who told the film’s writer, Scott Z. Burns, that he would serve as a technical adviser on the movie if he agreed to make it as scientifically accurate a film as possible.  In the film’s emotional denouement, Cheever visits the home of one the CDC’s janitors to deliver a vaccine, where he explains to the janitor’s son the origins of the handshake. (The scene was “designed” to disclose the history of the handshake,” Lipkin told me in an interview earlier this week.) “Do you know where this comes from? Shaking hands?” he asks the boy, after delivering the vaccine by pushing a swab up his nostril. “It was a way of showing a stranger you weren’t carrying a weapon in the old days.”  These days, we are all presumed to be armed and dangerous.",What I Learned About Coronavirus From Binge-watching 10 Hours of Virus Movies,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/21/pandemic-movies-coronavirus-140043,politico
"While Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sought on Friday to explain sales of stock made at a time when they were reassuring the public about the coronavirus threat, they weren’t the only elected officials to buy and sell stocks at key moments in the unfolding crisis. A POLITICO review of stock sales and purchases reported by members of Congress and senior aides found that while none had engaged in sales of the magnitude of Burr and Loeffler, several had traded shares at times or in industries that bore a relationship to the coronavirus threat. Previously unreported lawmakers who sold assets in the weeks leading up to the market crash include Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.), who unloaded thousands of dollars of stock in Alaska Air and Royal Caribbean cruises. A senior aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell made a mid-January purchase of Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology company that had four days earlier announced it would begin developing a coronavirus vaccine. And an aide to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sold off stock in companies including Delta Airlines in late January and later bought stock in Clorox, Inc., which makes bleach and sanitary wipes. The trades show that -- as much of the public was blindsided by both the pandemic and the economic meltdown over the last two weeks -- a number of lawmakers, aides and their brokers helping manage their portfolios adjusted their investments. Lawmakers in both chambers were being briefed via both classified and non-classified meetings about the coronavirus in late January and February, giving people on Capitol Hill a closer look at how the coming pandemic might shape their lives and finances that much of the country was lacking. “The reality is that if you work on the Hill, or you work in government, you have access to information that the public doesn't have or, if they have it, they can’t always see the signal through the noise,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of the watchdog group Issue One. “If you’re on the HELP Committee, you’re going to grasp threats much faster than the general public. You see things much more clearly.” Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Friday called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into his trades amid an uproar over reports that he had sought to safeguard his portfolio against the looming pandemic even as he assured the public all was well. Burr, who had been present for a classified briefing on the outbreak in late January, wrote an op-ed declaring the U.S. “better prepared than ever before” to face down the virus on Feb. 7 -- six days before unloading at least $628,000 of his own stock as the market was peaking.  The North Carolina Republican is one of several senators, including Loeffler, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. James Inhofe (R.-Okla.) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who sold stock in late January and early February as the Senate was ramping up coronavirus briefings. It’s illegal for lawmakers and aides to trade stocks based on private information. But they are allowed to buy and sell shares based on public information they absorb on Capitol Hill so long as they disclose those trades within 30 days. That permissive approach to buying and selling stocks -- the executive branch has much stricter rules -- has drawn criticism from watchdogs who argue the freedom to trade isn’t as important as the need for the public to trust Congress to act only on its behalf. Davis, the 10-term California Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Education and Labor Committees, unloaded stock on Feb. 11 in the airline and cruise industries, two sectors that have since been ground to a halt by the pandemic nearly two weeks before the market tanked. Davis’ spokesman said she has a “third party handling her portfolio and does not play a role in the purchase or sale of her stocks.” Other members stand to make money off companies working to combat the disease. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 of stock in the pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc., on Feb. 27, the day the company released a statement saying it had donated one of its antiviral drugs to China as an experimental option for treating the coronavirus and that it was exploring a research collaboration on potential treatment options.  Wittman’s office said he “does not have any involvement in investment decisions for his financial portfolio” and noted that AbbVie shares have since lost value. Still others were able to move their money to safe havens ahead of the general public. On Jan. 29, the day he and others were briefed on the coronavirus, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) sold between $500,001 and $1 million in Butte-Glenn municipal bonds. He and his wife moved over $2 million from local government bonds to U.S. Treasury notes, considered a port in the storm amid market turbulence, between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The muni bond market is currently facing strong headwinds. Peters’ office said he and his wife “sold one set of government bonds and bought other government bonds” and said the suggestion that it was linked to the virus briefing is “out of bounds.” Aides, who sometimes spend years working alongside their bosses on Capitol Hill and can play as much a role in shaping the response to a crisis as their bosses, also bought and sold stocks in January and February. Scott Sloofman, a top communications aide in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office, purchased stock in a company that could wind up being instrumental in the fight against the coronavirus in late January: Moderna, Inc., which is now testing the first vaccine for the disease in Washington state. Sloofman purchased the stock on Jan. 28, one week after Moderna, Inc. announced it was collaborating with the federal government to develop the vaccine. The company’s stock rose in the days since, at some points more than 20 percent. The purchase was listed as between $1,001 and $15,000 in value. A Senate aide familiar with the trade said Sloofman purchased just under $1,400 in stock. He bought the stock two weeks after seeing a CNBC segment featuring Moderna’s CEO discussing plans to develop new medications on Jan. 15, the aide said, and Sloofman does not focus on health care or national security policymaking for his job. Sarah Holmes, New Hampshire-based state director to New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and a longtime aide to the senator, sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Delta Airlines on Jan. 24, as lawmakers were beginning to be clued into the forthcoming crisis.  Holmes traded out two stocks a week later, on Jan. 29, then on Feb. 27 made two purchases that could prove advantageous in the weeks ahead: Holmes purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in each of two more companies, the pharmaceutical company Gilead, Inc. -- which makes remdesivir, a drug that is currently being tested to treat coronavirus -- and wipe manufacturer Clorox. The trades were made in a joint account, Shaheen spokesman Ryan Nickel said, and ""were made at the complete discretion of her broker with no input from Sarah or her husband.""  Additionally, the sale of the Delta stock on Jan. 24 was made prior to the classified Jan. 24 briefing for senators, Nickel said, at 9:30 a.m., and ""neither Senator Shaheen nor any of her staff were present for the classified briefing on Jan. 24."" Holmes does not have a security clearance and has complied with disclosure requirements, Nickel added. Though there is no current evidence that any of these elected officials or aides violated the law, there are several different bodies that could investigate lawmakers and aides for trading stocks. In addition to the ethics committees on Capitol Hill, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have the authority to launch probes of their own.  Burr and other lawmakers’ trades may be enough to spur a probe from the federal government, said Kevin Muhlendorf, a former investigator at the Department of Justice and SEC. “My gut on this is that based on the trading and the publicity, it’s highly likely that there will be some investigations by DOJ,"" said Muhlendorf.

"Mike Pence and his wife will be tested for coronavirus on Saturday afternoon, a day after one of the vice president's staffers tested positive for the infection.  Pence said here was ""no reason to believe"" he or his wife, Karen Pence, were exposed to the virus. But he said he will get tested because of his sensitive role in the Trump administration. Pence made the comments at a Saturday afternoon press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic alongside President Donald Trump.  ""We've done all contact tracing and while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon,"" Pence said.  The White House learned on Friday that a member of Pence's staff had tested positive for the coronavirus. Pence said the staffer ""had mild cold-like symptoms"" for about a day and a half but is ""doing well."" ""He has not been to the White House since Monday,"" Pence added. ""Neither the president nor I had direct contact with that staff person."" Trump took a test for the coronavirus last week, which the White House said was negative.  During his remarks on Saturday, Pence said 195,000 Americans have been tested for the coronavirus, a total that does not include tests done at county hospitals or health care labs. Of those tests, 19,343 came back positive, Pence said. Both numbers are expected to jump in the coming days as testing becomes more available. Almost 300 people in the U.S. have died form the disease thus far, according to researchers.  In an effort to slow the number of new coronavirus cases, the Trump administration has urged people to avoid groups larger than 10 people. Many theaters, restaurants, theme parks have shuttered and millions of people have shifted to remote work if possible. Churches and other places of worship have also taken their services online. Pence urged church-goers to continue donating to religious institutions, regardless of whether they can attend in person.  ""One thing the president and I promised was to remind people that on the weekends that you're not in the pews, it's still a good — it's still a good idea to, if you can, to go ahead and make that donation.

"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- As Florida officials move to expel the hundreds of thousands of spring-breakers who ignored calls for social distancing, public-health specialists are nervously wondering what will happen once the party’s over. For much of this week, revelers continued to cram four and five to a hotel room, swarm beaches over hundreds of miles of coastline, and then gather shoulder-to-shoulder in bars and clubs – almost a model process for spreading contagious diseases.  Now, with their campuses likely shuttered, most spring breakers will return to hometowns across the country where any exposure to coronavirus could set off a contagion, public-health experts warned. They called for greater vigilance in those communities and sharply criticized Florida authorities for their slowness in closing beaches and nightspots. “What is happening in Florida with spring break partying-on by students oblivious to the epidemiological implications of their actions is nothing short of tragic,” wrote Gregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, in an email. “While many of us have been hunkering down to try to break the chains of infection in our communities, these young people have decided the pleasures of the moment are worth bring back the coronavirus to their friends and family.”  Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the crush of swimsuit-clad students consuming large amounts of alcohol could create so-called “super-spreading events” that worsen the pandemic. “The students who are going and partying at spring break potentially are feeding into a world where they are stuck in their houses for weeks on end later on,” he said. “So I think they should keep that in mind."" There is some precedent for resort communities being slow to wake up to epidemics. The Austrian village of Ischgl, an Alpine ski destination and party hotspot, was slow to close down its establishments even as other nations issued travel warnings of potential coronavirus exposure. Thousands of revelers returning from vacations in Ischgl spread infections across much of Scandinavia. On Tuesday, Norway said 40 percent of its then-1,400 infections were traced to Ischgl. The outbreak has prompted accusations that authorities there acted too slowly out of a fear of harming the local tourist economy. Unlike other states, Florida did not initially impose strict controls on crowds and left it up to local officials to take action.  On Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars and nightclubs to close for 30 days and directed restaurants to cut their seating capacity by half. That same day he said that beaches could remain open but that groups of more than 10 people would not be allowed in one place. The edict wasn’t enforced. Aerial pictures of hundreds of thousands of beachgoers hit the national airwaves and shocked people in other states where even major thoroughfares were empty. Forced to explain his decision, DeSantis said he did not want to do a statewide order because there were places where the virus had not yet spread. People were on “edge,” he said, and he wanted them to be able to go outside. Some local officials stepped in. Those in Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Naples and Clearwater moved to shut their beaches down. On Friday, DeSantis ordered restaurants to shut their doors, except for takeout and delivery. He told gyms to shutter and closed the beaches and other “non-essential” businesses in Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach at the urging of local officials. This action came a day after Miami officials closed many businesses. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber told POLITICO on Friday that the city is finally getting spring breakers to leave after a month of revelry. Gelber ordered beaches shut on Thursday, and posted photos of the empty sandscape on Facebook on Friday.  Hotels will “substantially close” by Monday evening, Gelber announced in a late-Friday tweet. Gelber predicted the measures would reduce the transmission of coronavirus but, at this point, he didn’t know how much. Florida spring break went on for weeks before anyone took action, when the virus seemed less threatening.  “This is about risk management,” Gelber said. “It might have been too late a month ago, frankly.” Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said there have been no confirmed spring break coronavirus cases reported in the city. But Hansel Tookes, a public-health physician specializing in infectious diseases at University of Miami’s medical school, said no one knows how much the coronavirus has spread among spring breakers because of a lack of testing. Had there been enough tests, the students could have gone to clinics, and the sick ones could have isolated themselves in Florida before going home. “If there was testing, they could be isolated in say, a hotel or a place where they could remain alone until they were no longer infectious,” he said. “Younger people have more social interactions. There’s more transmission amongst them. Most people are infectious before they are symptomatic.” Indeed, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have found that the virus also spreads quickly even among people who are asymptomatic. Ten percent of patients are infected by someone who has no symptoms. So far, there’s no sign of a spring break surge in Florida's safety net hospitals, which would potentially be more likely to take in a struggling spring breaker. But It’s also too early. Infected Florida spring breakers are still incubating the illness, spreading the disease. And, state officials don’t know if there will be a surge in other parts of the country because they’re not tracking anyone who has left Florida without symptoms.  “There’s the strong possibility that we could start to see cases popping up after the incubation period. And if it’s not the spring breakers, their parents and grandparents are at high risk as well,” said Nitesh Paryani, an oncologist in Lakeland, who said his cancer specialty doesn't mean anything amid the public health crisis. “Everybody is treating coronavirus, whether we want to or not. All physicians are being pulled into this fight. It’s an all hands on deck situation.” Ironically, the risk of returning spring breakers carrying the virus has already manifested itself in Florida. In the city of Gainesville, home to the University of Florida, four students have tested positive. One of the students had returned from Portugal while on spring break, according to local media. The Gainesville Sun reported that one student was a dentistry student who worked in a clinic after returning. The revelation that there was positive tests among university students played into the university system’s decision to scrap in-person classes for the rest of the semester. Initially, schools planned to delay opening campuses after spring break and resume classes in early April. DeSantis admonished university students this week for returning to fraternity houses to party instead of going home. Florida State University President John Thrasher, whose college was on spring break this past week, said that he is hopeful that many of the school’s 41,000 plus students will stay away, even those who live off-campus locally. “We are doing everything we can to discourage them from going back,” Thrasher said. But while Florida schools contribute to the spring break crowds, students also stream in from the rest of the South and even the Midwest. And it’s not quite clear how many came to the state – and where they are going now that the bars, restaurants and many of the beaches have shut down. “I would think it next to impossible to track that many people and potential exposures,” said Craig Fugate, the former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who also led Florida’s emergency management agency when the state dealt with back-to-back hurricanes. “This may end up being tracked by spring breakers if they get sick here or once they get home and working backwards.” Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing arm, does not figures for this year, but says that more than 32 million visitors come to the state in March through May. An average of 2.7 million students come to Florida each year, the group estimates.  DeSantis acknowledged Thursday — at the opening of a South Florida mobile testing site — the unintended consequences of a March 11 directive that he and the State University System Board of Governors worked together on. They told students to delay returning to campus from spring break for two weeks.  “We were thinking, don’t come back yet,” DeSantis said. “Instead, they all went back, and they were drinking at the bars every night.” Despite the clear risks, experts said that several factors might mitigate the threat posed by the spring breakers. “It certainly has the potential to cause spread, but it may not be as dramatic as some people might think,"" said Lessler, the Johns Hopkins professor. Young people are more likely to be asymptomatic, and might therefore be less contagious, he said. Lessler also cited the short duration of spring break, which lasts about a week for most revelers. The generation time of the virus ranges from four to eight days, weighted towards the higher end, he said. That means that infected spring breakers could spread the virus to one other person, but there might not be enough time to pass the virus on again before heading home.  Still, all public-health officials who were interviewed warned that returning spring breakers could easily bring the virus to new parts of the country, as the disease continues its relentless spread. “Students on spring break are likely to introduce [coronavirus] into communities that have not yet been exposed to the virus, especially in quieter less well-connected parts of the country,” said William Hanage, professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an emailed statement. “However this does not change the fact that the virus is well established and community transmission is widespread. Once this has happened, limits on travel become much less important.”",Will spring breakers become super-spreaders?,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/spring-breakers-coronavirus-140609,politico
"The Justice Department has quietly asked Congress for the ability to ask chief judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies — part of a push for new powers that comes as the coronavirus spreads through the United States. Documents reviewed by POLITICO detail the department’s requests to lawmakers on a host of topics, including the statute of limitations, asylum and the way court hearings are conducted. POLITICO also reviewed and previously reported on documents seeking the authority to extend deadlines on merger reviews and prosecutions. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the documents. The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing that it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could legally deploy right now to try and slow the coronavirus outbreak. The DOJ requests — which are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House — span several stages of the legal process, from initial arrest to how cases are processed and investigated. In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.”  The proposal would also grant those top judges broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies. It would apply to “any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,” according to draft legislative language the department shared with Congress. In making the case for the change, the DOJ document wrote that individual judges can currently pause proceedings during emergencies, but that their proposal would make sure all judges in any particular district could handle emergencies “in a consistent manner.”  The request raised eyebrows because of its potential implications for habeas corpus –– the constitutional right to appear before a judge after arrest and seek release. “Not only would it be a violation of that, but it says ‘affecting pre-arrest,’” said Norman L. Reimer, the executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over. I find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.” Reimer said the possibility of chief judges suspending all court rules during an emergency without a clear end in sight was deeply disturbing. “That is something that should not happen in a democracy,” he said. The department also asked Congress to pause the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies, “and for one year following the end of the national emergency,” according to the draft legislative text. Trump recently declared the coronavirus crisis a national emergency.  Another controversial request: The department is looking to change the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in some cases to expand the use of videoconference hearings, and to let some of those hearings happen without defendants’ consent, according to the draft legislative text. “Video teleconferencing may be used to conduct an appearance under this rule,” read a draft of potential new language for Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f), crossing out the phrase “if the defendant consents.”  “Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant,” read draft text of rule 10(c), again striking out the phrase “if the defendant consents.” Reimer said forcing people to have hearings over video rather than in person would threaten civil liberties. “If it were with the consent of the accused person it would be fine,” he said. “But if it’s not with the consent of the accused person, it’s a terrible road to go down. We have a right to public trials. People have a right to be present in court.” The department also wants Congress to change the law to explicitly say that people with Covid-19 –– the illness caused by the novel coronavirus –– are not included among those who may apply for asylum. And the department asked for the same change regarding people who are “subject to a presidential proclamation suspending and limiting the entry of aliens into the United States,” according to the draft legislative language. Layli Miller-Munro, the CEO of the Tahirih Justice Center, which advocates for women and girls fleeing violence, said the language would block anyone on a presidential travel ban list from seeking asylum in the U.S. “I think it’s a humanitarian tragedy that fails to recognize that vulnerable people from those countries are among the most persecuted and that protecting them is exactly what the refugee convention was designed to do,” she said. The asylum request comes as the Trump administration on Friday said that it would begin denying entry to all migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border, including those seeking asylum. “I hope we come out of this with a sense of oneness, interconnectedness,” Miller-Munro said of the coronavirus pandemic. “Borders can’t protect us. Viruses do not care.”",DOJ seeks new emergency powers amid coronavirus pandemic,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023,politico
"One of Kelly Loeffler’s most appealing traits to Republicans who embraced her for a coveted Senate appointment — her ability to self-fund a competitive election this fall through immense wealth — is suddenly looking like a serious liability for her and the GOP. Loeffler’s rivals in a special election pounced on revelations that the recently appointed senator dumped millions of dollars in stocks after a classified Covid-19 briefing in January — damaging her bid against a formidable GOP opponent in Rep. Doug Collins, a close ally of President Donald Trump. Collins is seizing on the stock trades by Loeffler, who’s married to the head of the New York Stock Exchange. Collins told POLITICO in an interview Friday that Loeffler needs “to explain to Georgians and Americans what happened here, and why it happened.” “To have sold and then bought stocks that benefit them personally is just very, very frustrating,” Collins said. ""And it's very disheartening for those of us who have been in public service."" “This is just not something you want to see, being perceived as profiting off a crisis,” Collins added, though he did not call on her to resign or face an Senate Ethics Committee investigation. Loeffler denied doing anything inappropriate, saying the stocks were sold by third-party financial advisers, and that she did not use information from private briefings about the coronavirus to benefit herself financially. She reported selling between nearly $1.3 million and $3.1 million worth of stocks owned jointly with her husband between late January and mid-February. She also reported jointly purchasing between $200,000 and $500,000 of stock in two technology companies. “I don't direct the activity. I'm not involved in the investment decisions,” Loeffler said in an interview on CNBC Friday afternoon. “I made that decision many years ago for the position I had in financial services — that I would not get involved in investment decisions."" The Georgia special election is already perilous for Republicans, given that it is an all-party contest that will go to a January runoff if no candidate receives a majority in November — a likely outcome given the crowd of contenders. Three Democrats are in the race currently: Rev. Raphael Warnock; former U.S. Attorney Ed Tarver; and Matt Lieberman, son of former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.). Warnock has endorsements from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial candidate. Loeffler has the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Gov. Brian Kemp, who appointed her to the seat to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned late last year due to health concerns. But Collins also has some significant allies in the state, and he is running an insurgent campaign attempting to outflank Loeffler as an ally to Trump, who has not taken sides in the race. One Georgia Republican operative, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said Loeffler was in a “perilous” political situation caused by the revelations about her stocks specifically because, in the all-party November contest, another Republican was on the ballot. “They can't just appeal to partisan loyalties and say, 'Don't believe these storylines. This is a media attack,'” the operative said. “People have somewhere else to go if they're uncertain about her, and that's a really dangerous place to be.” The accusations of self-dealing while the U.S. copes with the unprecedented coronavirus crisis — combined with reports that other senators, including Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), also sold off stocks before the market crashed — represent a major early test for Loeffler, a first-time political candidate on whom Republicans are counting to keep a contested Senate seat in GOP hands as Democrats mount a charge to retake the chamber in this year's elections. Some Democrats immediately called for Loeffler's resignation following the initial report from The Daily Beast about the transactions, which came in the days and weeks following a private briefing for senators on the coronavirus. Others called for an investigation by the Ethics Committee. Lieberman said in a statement that Loeffler’s actions were “incredibly disappointing and shameful.” Warnock, national Democrats' preferred candidate in the race, called the transactions “deeply disappointing” and said they should be investigated. Tarver, the former U.S. attorney, said Loeffler should resign. “This is more than just poor judgment,” Tarver said. “This is downright wrong and everything that’s wrong with Washington. We’re in the middle of a pandemic the likes of which many of us having never seen. We need honest leadership in Washington, and it’s clear we’re not getting that with Sen. Loeffler.” Stephen Lawson, a spokesperson for her campaign, said Loeffler ""has done absolutely nothing wrong"" and hit both Collins and Democrats for ""spending their time launching baseless attacks"" against the senator. Burr, who also faced swift condemnation for his sale of stocks in recent weeks, asked the Ethics Committee to review the matter. Loeffler, who did multiple cable news interviews Friday to push back on the reports, said in the appearance on CNBC that she was “happy to answer any and all questions and would submit to whatever review is needed,” but she has not called on the Ethics Committee to look into the matter. “I think we have to make sure that all the rules and laws are followed,” Loeffler said on CNBC. “I think they are being followed, at least in my case I know they are. I can't speak for other people. But that's certainly what securities laws are for. That's what ethics rules are for. That's what I'm very confident we are complying with, have always complied with and will continue to do.""",Loeffler stock trades roil Georgia special election,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/loeffler-stock-trades-roil-georgia-special-election-140088,politico
"The White House Correspondents’ Association is postponing its giant dinner scheduled for late April, but still hopes to hold the annual event this summer or fall if the coronavirus threat abates.  The WHCD joins a long list of prominent events that have been postponed or scrapped altogether in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has sickened thousands across the globe and prompted calls for widespread “social distancing” in affected areas. In the U.S., where Trump has declared the pandemic a national emergency, the outbreak has shuttered schools across the country, prompted the suspension of major sports leagues’ entire seasons, postponed music festivals and shut down American landmarks like the U.S. Capitol, Broadway and Disneyland. Coronavirus has also thrown a wrench into the 2020 elections, with presidential campaigns ditching in-person rallies and at least one state moving to delay its primary elections.  The featured entertainment for this year’s iteration of the WHCA gala — the marquee event of a spring weekend around which a small ecosystem of elite gatherings has sprung — would have been Saturday Night Live cast member Kenan Thompson and comedian Hasan Minhaj. The inclusion of comedy headliners at the dinner marked a return to historical precedent. The dinner, which celebrates political journalism by handing out awards and scholarships, has traditionally featured a comedy act as well as remarks from the sitting president. But after a sharply criticized set from comedian Michelle Wolf at the 2018 dinner, the WCHA opted for less controversial entertainment by picking historian Ron Chernow to serve as the night’s featured speaker.  President Donald Trump has, in keeping with his disruption of a laundry list of other presidential norms, refused to attend the dinner throughout his tenure in office. Instead, Trump has counter-programmed the glitzy event with political rallies in swing states that he won in the 2016 election. Last year, the president ordered administration officials to boycott the dinner. But he had not announced whether he planned to attend this year’s dinner.",White House Correspondents' Association postpones annual dinner,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/white-house-correspondents-association-postpones-2020-dinner-140431,politico
"Senate negotiators and the White House on Saturday are scrambling to reach an accord on a stimulus package that’s likely to exceed $1 trillion, staring down an aggressive timeline to deliver relief amid the rapidly worsening coronavirus outbreak. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has set a deadline of Saturday afternoon for both sides to settle on the terms of the legislation, after failing to do so after more than 12 hours of talks on Friday, splitting on key issues such as how to get financial help directly to Americans hurt by the crisis. “We’re getting closer and closer to an agreement,” McConnell told reporters Saturday. “I think we’re clearly going to get there.“ Senate Republicans tried to break the impasse on Saturday morning, delivering their latest bid to Democrats on the biggest remaining sticking point: Unemployment insurance. The two sides huddled separately as Republicans and White House officials await the next steps from Democrats, who are seeking longer-term benefits for furloughed workers, rather than direct payments as GOP leaders have pushed. ""I had a very good conversation with [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin and we are making good progress on many of the issues Democrats care about,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Saturday.  Mnuchin declined to comment on the talks, but told reporters that he's also spoken with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, and plans to speak with Speaker Nancy Pelosi later in the day. Democrats would not disclose details of the GOP’s latest proposal, but said it would get the Senate closer to a deal. “I would say it’s a pretty good faith offer, but it’s not one that we can finally accept, we have to move it a little more, but we’re pretty close,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who is among the negotiators, told reporters. But the New Jersey Democrat wouldn’t commit to meeting the afternoon deadline to reaching a final agreement and producing legislative text. “This is going to be the largest — when it’s all concluded — relief package in history. So yes, speed is necessary, but getting this done right, so it actually has the effect that we want, is equally important,” Menendez said. As negotiations progress, the size and scope of the package appeared to steadily increase. The price tag of the legislation is now expected to exceed $1.3 trillion, according to National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. The total size of the package, including loans from the federal government, would likely exceed 10 percent of GDP — roughly $2 trillion, he said. That would include a payroll tax holiday for small businesses.  McConnell is pushing hard for a deal, and GOP lawmakers and White House officials warn they will start drafting their own bill if no accord is reached with Democrats by Saturday afternoon. McConnell wants the normally slow-moving Senate to complete work on the rescue package by Monday. Among the outstanding issues are assistance for hospitals, a ""State Stabilization Fund,"" which would assist state governments with looming revenue shortfalls during the pandemic, and unemployment insurance. Democrats are pushing for workers to see their full wages compensated, while Republicans argue that the state agencies do not have the capacity to meet this demand. White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland said Saturday that there's been a ""lot of great progress on a bipartisan basis between Republicans and Democrats"" but acknowledged the differences on unemployment insurance.  ""We've discussed some of the technical challenges,"" Ueland said. ""I'm hopeful we understand more on the unemployment piece today."" Democrats are also calling for expanded paid sick leave. But so far there doesn't appear to be much appetite among Republicans for the idea.  The Senate pushed through the House's package earlier this week which included new paid sick leave provisions. While the Senate approved the measure in a 90-8 vote, McConnell had to convince his caucus to support it and vowed to address shortcomings in this new, third stimulus package. The discussions come after Senate Republicans introduced a $1 trillion package Thursday to salvage the economy by providing assistance to individuals, small businesses and industries. Under the GOP proposal, individuals and families would receive $1,200 and $2,400 in direct cash payments based on their income. But some Republicans, including Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), say the proposal's structure — as written — penalizes lower income Americans who do not have a taxable income. Hawley has an amendment to address the issue and Senate Republican aides appear open to negotiating. In addition to the direct cash payments, Republicans are pushing for $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and $200 billion for loans to hard-hit industries. Aides are also discussing adding more money for eligible industries to the package. Senate Democrats are also calling for a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals to help prepare for a surge in cases due to the pandemic. Schumer and Pelosi (D-Calif.), who are working in lockstep on the negotiations, argue that the Republican proposal prioritizes businesses over workers. Republicans and the White House appear open to more hospital assistance.",Senate races to finish negotiations on massive coronavirus stimulus package,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/senate-coronavirus-stimulus-negotiations-140334,politico

"While Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sought on Friday to explain sales of stock made at a time when they were reassuring the public about the coronavirus threat, they weren’t the only elected officials to buy and sell stocks at key moments in the unfolding crisis. A POLITICO review of stock sales and purchases reported by members of Congress and senior aides found that while none had engaged in sales of the magnitude of Burr and Loeffler, several had traded shares at times or in industries that bore a relationship to the coronavirus threat. Previously unreported lawmakers who sold assets in the weeks leading up to the market crash include Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.), who unloaded thousands of dollars of stock in Alaska Air and Royal Caribbean cruises. A senior aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell made a mid-January purchase of Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology company that had four days earlier announced it would begin developing a coronavirus vaccine. And an aide to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sold off stock in companies including Delta Airlines in late January and later bought stock in Clorox, Inc., which makes bleach and sanitary wipes. The trades show that -- as much of the public was blindsided by both the pandemic and the economic meltdown over the last two weeks -- a number of lawmakers, aides and their brokers helping manage their portfolios adjusted their investments. Lawmakers in both chambers were being briefed via both classified and non-classified meetings about the coronavirus in late January and February, giving people on Capitol Hill a closer look at how the coming pandemic might shape their lives and finances that much of the country was lacking. “The reality is that if you work on the Hill, or you work in government, you have access to information that the public doesn't have or, if they have it, they can’t always see the signal through the noise,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of the watchdog group Issue One. “If you’re on the HELP Committee, you’re going to grasp threats much faster than the general public. You see things much more clearly.” Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Friday called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into his trades amid an uproar over reports that he had sought to safeguard his portfolio against the looming pandemic even as he assured the public all was well. Burr, who had been present for a classified briefing on the outbreak in late January, wrote an op-ed declaring the U.S. “better prepared than ever before” to face down the virus on Feb. 7 -- six days before unloading at least $628,000 of his own stock as the market was peaking.  The North Carolina Republican is one of several senators, including Loeffler, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. James Inhofe (R.-Okla.) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who sold stock in late January and early February as the Senate was ramping up coronavirus briefings. It’s illegal for lawmakers and aides to trade stocks based on private information. But they are allowed to buy and sell shares based on public information they absorb on Capitol Hill so long as they disclose those trades within 30 days. That permissive approach to buying and selling stocks -- the executive branch has much stricter rules -- has drawn criticism from watchdogs who argue the freedom to trade isn’t as important as the need for the public to trust Congress to act only on its behalf. Davis, the 10-term California Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Education and Labor Committees, unloaded stock on Feb. 11 in the airline and cruise industries, two sectors that have since been ground to a halt by the pandemic nearly two weeks before the market tanked. Davis’ spokesman said she has a “third party handling her portfolio and does not play a role in the purchase or sale of her stocks.” Other members stand to make money off companies working to combat the disease. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 of stock in the pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc., on Feb. 27, the day the company released a statement saying it had donated one of its antiviral drugs to China as an experimental option for treating the coronavirus and that it was exploring a research collaboration on potential treatment options.  Wittman’s office said he “does not have any involvement in investment decisions for his financial portfolio” and noted that AbbVie shares have since lost value. The office later added that Wittman's initial AbbVie purchase was for $1,218. Still others were able to move their money to safe havens ahead of the general public. On Jan. 29, the day he and others were briefed on the coronavirus, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) sold between $500,001 and $1 million in Butte-Glenn municipal bonds. He and his wife moved over $2 million from local government bonds to U.S. Treasury notes, considered a port in the storm amid market turbulence, between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The muni bond market is currently facing strong headwinds. Peters’ office said he and his wife “sold one set of government bonds and bought other government bonds” and said the suggestion that it was linked to the virus briefing is “out of bounds.” Aides, who sometimes spend years working alongside their bosses on Capitol Hill and can play as much a role in shaping the response to a crisis as their bosses, also bought and sold stocks in January and February. Scott Sloofman, a top communications aide in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office, purchased stock in a company that could wind up being instrumental in the fight against the coronavirus in late January: Moderna, Inc., which is now testing the first vaccine for the disease in Washington state. Sloofman purchased the stock on Jan. 28, one week after Moderna, Inc. announced it was collaborating with the federal government to develop the vaccine. The company’s stock rose in the days since, at some points more than 20 percent. The purchase was listed as between $1,001 and $15,000 in value. A Senate aide familiar with the trade said Sloofman purchased just under $1,400 in stock. He bought the stock two weeks after seeing a CNBC segment featuring Moderna’s CEO discussing plans to develop new medications on Jan. 15, the aide said, and Sloofman does not focus on health care or national security policymaking for his job. Sarah Holmes, New Hampshire-based state director to New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and a longtime aide to the senator, sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Delta Airlines on Jan. 24, as lawmakers were beginning to be clued into the forthcoming crisis.  Holmes traded out two stocks a week later, on Jan. 29, then on Feb. 27 made two purchases that could prove advantageous in the weeks ahead: Holmes purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in each of two more companies, the pharmaceutical company Gilead, Inc. -- which makes remdesivir, a drug that is currently being tested to treat coronavirus -- and wipe manufacturer Clorox. The trades were made in a joint account, Shaheen spokesman Ryan Nickel said, and ""were made at the complete discretion of her broker with no input from Sarah or her husband.""  Additionally, the sale of the Delta stock on Jan. 24 was made prior to the classified Jan. 24 briefing for senators, Nickel said, at 9:30 a.m., and ""neither Senator Shaheen nor any of her staff were present for the classified briefing on Jan. 24."" Holmes does not have a security clearance and has complied with disclosure requirements, Nickel added. Though there is no current evidence that any of these elected officials or aides violated the law, there are several different bodies that could investigate lawmakers and aides for trading stocks. In addition to the ethics committees on Capitol Hill, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have the authority to launch probes of their own.  Burr and other lawmakers’ trades may be enough to spur a probe from the federal government, said Kevin Muhlendorf, a former investigator at the Department of Justice and SEC. “My gut on this is that based on the trading and the publicity, it’s highly likely that there will be some investigations by DOJ,"" said Muhlendorf.

"Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart spoke out Saturday about his battle with COVID-19 after testing positive for the coronavirus, saying he believes the “worst part"" has passed.  “It’s a tricky bug because just when I thought I was over it or I was pretty close to getting over it, the fever will come back,” the Florida Republican said during his first on-camera interview on NBC's ""Nightly News.""  Diaz-Belart, 58, recalled the symptoms he said “hit him like a ton of bricks” last Saturday after he voted on a coronavirus response bill on the House floor, describing a headache that quickly developed into a fever and cough.   “Now luckily, I have not had an issue breathing so I’ve never had a scary moment but obviously very, very unpleasant with headaches, with coughing, and with a pretty intense fever — all coming at the same time it seems,” he recounted.  Rep. Ben McAdams, 45, the second congressman who has tested positive for the coronavirus, detailed a similar experience.   “I’m feeling about as sick as I’ve been,” the Utah Democrat said during a CNN interview on Friday. “I got really labored breathing. I feel like I have a belt around my chest, really tight. When I cough, my muscles are so sore so I just feel pain every time I cough, which is frequently. I feel short of breath, and I have a fever of about 102. So, it’s pretty bad.”  Diaz-Balart said he has continued with his work while self-quarantining in Washington, D.C., but said there are constitutional questions that need to be answered before allowing fellow lawmakers to vote from home.   “I know that the leadership, House and Senate — bipartisan — they're looking at ways to make sure that they keep people safe and allow Congress to proceed, so we just got to make sure it's done right and it's done safely, but also that it's done constitutionally,” Diaz-Balart said.

"After months of minimizing the threat to the United States, President Donald Trump jumped feet-first into the coronavirus fight this week with vows of quick fixes to the testing problem, claims about potential cures, and efforts to rope in agencies that had inexplicably been excluded, like FEMA. The show of action played well in the White House briefing room and with the public, but has had a different impact behind the scenes. Health-agency officials and outside advisers to the administration, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described a chaotic situation in which leaders rushed to address presidential requests that sometimes seem to come on a whim while losing focus on longer-term challenges. Trump’s drive to announce unfinished initiatives created a “need to make good on half-baked promises,” said one senior official — who, like other Americans, learned about some initiatives only when the president announced them at the White House podium. For instance, no one in the White House had devised a national strategy for obtaining and distributing the necessary supplies in the likely months-long fight against the pandemic that lies ahead, said three people with knowledge of the planning efforts. Those supply-planning efforts are only now underway. “How is there not a national supply strategy yet?” asked one official involved in the effort, warning that the infamous shortage of coronavirus tests is set to be replicated with other shortages across the health system. “Hospitals are going to run out of basic commodities.” The U.S. health system already has been plagued by shortages of test-kit chemicals, swabs and personal protective equipment for health workers, problems that are set to worsen as coronavirus case numbers rise and demand spikes. A government effort to obtain replacement test swabs required the U.S. military this week to airlift the specialized swabs from a factory located in coronavirus-stricken Italy. Meanwhile, leaders in coronavirus hotspots like Seattle and New York City have effectively abandoned efforts to conduct broad testing on residents, instead urging them to stay home given the shortages — an acknowledgment that efforts to contain coronavirus have failed and they need to prioritize limited supplies. Local officials also are making unusual crowdsourcing appeals. “We need companies to be creative to supply the crucial gear our healthcare workers need. NY will pay a premium and offer funding,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Friday. “If you have any of these unused supplies, please email [email protected].” A sympathetic HHS staffer compared Cuomo’s plea to an Internet auction. “We’re facing a pandemic and the governor has to basically turn to eBay” for supplies, the staffer said. Trump has worked to tamp down concerns about insufficient tests and supplies, saying that the flurry of federal, state and local efforts will be sufficient. “If California can get a mask sooner than we can get it for them, through all of the things we're able to do, we'll end up with a big over-supply,” the president said at a press conference on Saturday. “At some point this is going away.” Spokespeople for the Trump administration defended its planning and coordination for the coronavirus outbreak. “We’ve been working since January with American manufacturers to prepare for responding to the outbreak and will continue to coordinate closely with private suppliers and our federal partners to ensure that resources are going where they’re needed,” an HHS spokesperson said. The White House said that Trump’s leadership had sparked an ""unprecedented collaboration"" of government and private industry to curb the virus’ spread and ramp up the response. “The president has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people and he is working around the clock to ensure we emerge from this crisis healthy, safe, and strong,” said spokesperson Judd Deere. Inside the Trump administration, officials are continuing to sort out which teams are responsible for elements of coronavirus response, part of an ever-shifting patchwork of alliances and strategy, while working to manage the president’s unpredictable requests. Five officials said that Trump had grown appropriately concerned about the coronavirus outbreak after weeks of ignoring or playing down the threat, but that the administration is now rushing to solve issues that could have been addressed months ago, like obtaining the necessary supplies for the nation’s emergency stockpile. Officials also are sniping over whether to institute even more aggressive actions to prevent coronavirus transmission. Health officials are calling for stricter measures that would keep more Americans at home, for longer, but policy officials warn that the resulting economic damage could cause other, long-lasting harms. The Federal Emergency Management Agency this week took over responsibilities that had rested with the Health and Human Services department, the latest attempt to get a handle on the worsening outbreak. “FEMA is now leading federal operations for #COVID19 on behalf of the White House,” administrator Pete Gaynor tweeted on Thursday night, as some projects like drive-through test sites shifted from the health department. The agency is also taking on a larger role handling supply and distribution issues, Gaynor and other officials said at Saturday’s briefing. “The tendency is to think of FEMA as a disaster management agency,” said Craig Fugate, who ran FEMA during the Obama administration and said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration’s strategy. “It’s actually an all-hazards agency… and FEMA could add structure, planning, location to the coronavirus response,” with its regional offices and staff with crisis-management experience. Some officials and outside advisers have questioned why FEMA had not been given more authority earlier in the response given the agency’s operational expertise in responding to disasters. Two individuals said that HHS Secretary Alex Azar had focused on protecting his leadership role, which has shrunk as Vice President Mike Pence took over the broader response and deputies whom Azar had originally sidelined — like Medicare chief Seema Verma and Surgeon General Jerome Adams — have emerged as key figures in White House strategy.  But a person familiar with HHS strategy said that Azar had pushed “weeks ago” for FEMA to be involved. The hold-up was instead linked to the federal response’s rotating leadership — as Pence abruptly took over for Azar at the end of February — and administration worries that states would be further confused over who was in charge. “Secretary Azar and HHS have been and continue to be wholly supportive of a whole-of-government approach and in particular the important role FEMA is playing in coordinating the federal government’s response to COVID-19,” an HHS spokesperson said. Meanwhile, a SWAT team of government officials and outside technocrats, backed by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, spent the week working around-the-clock to deliver the drive-through testing sites that Trump publicly promised, POLITICO first reported. But the focus on drive-through testing also creates a new problem — draining limited supplies and other resources that could be used for high-priority patients in hospitals. “It’s all short-term thinking right now,” said one official involved in the response.  “They’re desperate to expand testing — which is a good idea — but I don’t know whether the president, the vice president and others at the top understand the trade-offs,” added an adviser to the effort. “It feels like each of these problems is a mini-crisis being run by a mini-team in the government.” Trump’s own involvement has caused additional headaches. Health department officials were confused on Wednesday after Trump announced that an “exciting FDA announcement” was on the way — particularly because Food and Drug Administration officials had yet to greenlight new drugs that Trump sought to fight the virus, The Wall Street Journal reported.  While Trump did hold a Thursday press conference with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn and other officials, the event largely rehashed existing policies and work that had already been announced. Trump on Friday also repeatedly made claims about an unproven coronavirus treatment, prompting infectious-disease scientist Anthony Fauci to try and walk back the claims from the White House podium. Meanwhile, the president has repeatedly touted unfinished projects, like announcing on March 13 a Google website that he said would help coordinate testing. But the actual site, which rolled out a week later, is instead a collection of information and links. Trump on Friday also claimed that General Motors has “openly stated” it would produce medical supplies. But GM has not publicly committed to producing more supplies, although the company is working with ventilator specialist Ventec to boost its production, according to a joint statement rushed out on Friday after Trump’s remarks. ""All options are on the table on how GM can help Ventec build more ventilators,"" a GM spokesperson said. The chaotic response also has trickled down to individual hospitals, clinics and doctors, which have struggled to get answers on supply chains and fought to protect their equipment. Sen. Bill Cassidy’s office reached out to the White House on Wednesday after learning that University Medical Center in Louisiana was informed that a new lab-testing machine, due to arrive on Monday, had instead been requisitioned by government officials for a “higher priority” coronavirus situation. “We thought the machine was a high priority in Louisiana given the fast rate that things were spreading,” said a spokesperson for Cassidy’s office, noting that the state has become a hotspot for coronavirus transmission. The White House later assured Cassidy’s office that the machine would go to Louisiana next week, as originally intended. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has spent weeks competing with states and hospitals to obtain medical supplies and quickly build up national reserves. “Every single governor across the country is looking for the exact same thing,” FEMA’s Gaynor said at Saturday’s White House press briefing, responding to questions about shortages. Some experts said the president would be better served by developing a national strategy to allocate limited resources to the neediest areas while obtaining new ones, say experts, noting that dozens of individual components in the health system are at risk of being quickly diminished in the initial crush of cases — from the intricate chemicals needed for tests to the basic supplies that could’ve been rapidly produced months ago. “We’re seeing a run on swabs,” said a former official, arguing that the Trump administration should have anticipated the worldwide demand for the specialized, low-cost swabs needed to do the testing. “How on Earth did we let this happen?” Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, listed off the supply shortages that already are plaguing hospitals. “They say they don’t have reagents for the diagnostic kits, they don’t have swabs for the kits, they don’t have the N95 masks, they’re running out of gowns and gloves,” said Inglesby, who’s called on the White House to overhaul its approach and assign specialists, such as the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency, to solve the supply-chain problems. “I don't think we should see these as spot shortages that will soon be resolved with significant effort,” Inglesby added. “We will be using large amounts of these supplies for a long time. COVID will be with us for a long time — we need a long-term solution.” Meanwhile, Trump on Saturday was asked about “the plan” to contain coronavirus as the nation enters day 6 of the White House’s 15-day campaign to slow the virus’ spread, and specifically whether additional measures needed to be taken. The president declined to detail next steps, saying only that leaders would know more next week.  “We’ll have to see what the result is,” Trump said.",Short-term thinking plagues Trump’s coronavirus response,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/short-term-thinking-trump-coronavirus-response-140883,politico
"The Trump administration is considering whether to create a special enrollment period for Obamacare coverage because of the coronavirus emergency, a CMS spokesperson confirmed. A number of Democratic-leaning states that run their own health insurance marketplaces have recently reopened enrollment, encouraging uninsured residents to get covered amid the pandemic. Most states, however, use the federal marketplace overseen by the Trump administration, HealthCare.gov. Major health insurance lobbies on Friday said they would support reopening enrollment in Obamacare markets if the government covered anticipated losses, despite some initial reluctance. Some insurers feared getting saddled with huge costs if many coronavirus patients signed up for coverage. The insurer lobbies, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called on Congress this week to include funding in the upcoming coronavirus stimulus package to offset potential losses from covering more people. The Wall Street Journal first reported the administration was weighing a special enrollment period. A spokesperson for CMS, which oversees the insurance marketplaces, said people should also check HealthCare.gov to see if they already qualify for a special enrollment period because they lost their job or other circumstances.",Trump officials weigh reopening Obamacare enrollment over coronavirus,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/trump-administration-obamacare-coronavirus-140806,politico
"American citizens in Peru who are trying to head home in response to the coronavirus outbreak are being held there by a Peruvian government that first wants assurances thousands of Peruvian citizens will be able to return from the U.S., according to two sources familiar with the situation. Peru is in the process of shutting down all international travel, but thousands of Americans are believed to remain in the country. An U.S. official familiar with the situation said the Peruvian government is not allowing them to leave until the White House ensures thousands of Peruvians are given safe passage home. “The government of Peru is basically holding these Americans hostage,” the U.S. official said. “They want the U.S. to fill planes with Peruvians before they’ll let the planes land to pick up Americans. But they’re not ready or organized in the United States to gather their people up, and they don’t want to pay for the flight.“ One American stuck in the South American nation said he received similar information from the office of Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Feinstein’s office did not respond to a request for comment. “[The State Department’s] planned repatriation flights have not yet been approved by the Peruvian government,” read an email from Feinstein’s office to the stranded Americans. “They are requesting reciprocal support for their own citizens to leave the United States.” The State Department said it flew a group of Americans home on Saturday, including “medically vulnerable” citizens and some Peace Corps volunteers and embassy personnel. But a spokesperson did not comment on whether the Peruvian government is preventing the rest from leaving. U.S. diplomats estimate a few thousand Americans remain in Peru, a spokesperson did not respond to a question about the number. Peruvian officials, meanwhile, say they are merely trying to figure out how best to get each nation’s residents home. ""We are actively engaging State Department officials to coordinate in a harmonic way the best way to carry out bringing Americans from Peru back to the U.S. and Peruvians in the U.S. back to Peru,"" said Rodolfo Pereira, press counselor for the Peruvian Embassy in Washington. ""What we are trying to set up is the best system to conduct that operation."" Pereira dismissed questions about tensions between the two sides, saying there are constant communications, including at high levels, and that much of what is being discussed is logistics. In a phone interview, he said he didn't know exactly how many Peruvians in the United States were trying to get back home, but estimated that it was about 6,000. He described them as a mix of students, vacationers and temporary workers. He noted that Peru's government was trying to help its citizens stranded in other countries return as well while Peru imposes a full shutdown of its borders and airports. Asked about criticism that Peru was essentially taking Americans hostage until its citizens were brought back, Pereira said, ""No, that's not the case,."" He said it was simply a matter of reciprocity. ""It's a two-way conversation,"" he said. He did not immediately respond to a follow-up question about whether Peru will cover the cost of the flights. He also urged Americans stranded in Peru to visit websites his government has arranged if they need assistance. Americans also remain stuck abroad in other countries, including Guatemala, which closed its borders this past week. The U.S. citizens there, having received little help from the embassy and unable to book flights home, are crossing the border with Mexico in droves to get to airports where planes are still taking off back to the U.S., several people on the ground told POLITICO. The State Department on Friday began flying charter flights from Morocco, another hotspot for Americans stranded abroad, back to 10 different U.S. airports. The U.S. government has made ""individual efforts"" to bring home about 3,000 Americans since the outbreak began affecting flight service, Vice President Mike Pence said at a Saturday afternoon White House press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, ""I think there is an ongoing effort to address that with chartered commercial flights that the government is providing,"" Pence said. Military transport is also available, he said. ""We would just encourage any American that is looking on from overseas, contact the local U.S. Embassy,"" Pence said. ""Let them know about your circumstances. And know that we're going to work, continue to work very diligently to get our Americans home.""","Peru spars with U.S. over letting stranded Americans fly home during coronavirus outbreak

"Puerto Rico on Saturday became the eighth jurisdiction to postpone its presidential primary as the coronavirus spreads across the United States, according to a statement from the island's Democratic Party. The U.S. territory joins seven states in postponing primaries over the virus, as governments race to enact policies to prevent mass gatherings.  Puerto Rico was originally scheduled to hold its primary on March 29 and will now hold it no earlier than April 26. With Puerto Rico's suspension, no more primaries will be held in March. So far, seven states have postponed their primaries: Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Maryland and Ohio.  ""Without a doubt, this is the time for preventative measures to stop the spread of the virus. But even in this crisis, both the legislature and the governor highlighted the democratic freedoms and rights that allow us to be a society based on the value of voting, as an expression of the will of the majority of our people,"" Charles Rodríguez, the chair of the Puerto Rico Democratic Party, said in a statement. The next set of presidential primaries on the calendar is scheduled for April 4, the day Louisiana was originally scheduled to vote. Alaska, Hawaii and Wyoming are set to vote on that day. Wyoming, which is hosting a caucus, has already canceled in-person caucusing for a mail-in and drop-off only option. Alaska and Hawaii's party-run primaries already have vote-by-mail options. Puerto RIco's primary was changed after Gov. Wanda Vazquez signed a resolution that passed through the island's legislature.

"The Justice Department is asking Congress to let it extend deadlines on merger reviews and price-fixing prosecutions because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to documents viewed by POLITICO. The proposal — which the agency hopes to have included in the next round of pandemic legislation — would let the DOJ and its sister agency, the FTC, add 15 days onto merger timelines during emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters or government shutdowns. Prosecutors are also asking to stop the clock on price-fixing and bid-rigging cases, a move that would ensure that the pandemic doesn’t let companies that fixed prices on generic drugs off the hook. Under current law, all mergers valued at more than $94 million have to be notified to the United States' two antitrust agencies, which have 30 days to decide whether to undertake an in-depth review. The legislative proposal would change that to 45 days. The FTC and DOJ receive notices on more than 2,000 deals annually, and seek additional information, known as a second-request, in about 3 to 5 percent of cases. After a company provides the additional details, the FTC or DOJ must decide within 30 days whether to challenge a deal. In the majority of cases, companies agree with the agency to extend that timeline in the hopes of reaching a settlement to avoid a lawsuit. Both the FTC and DOJ said this week that they would be asking companies with pending deals for additional time to complete their reviews. But with the markets in turmoil, some companies are less willing to give the agency extensions over fears that deal financing may fall through, an individual with several pending deals before the agencies said. Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, estimated Friday that U.S. corporate revenues will decline by about $4 trillion because of the coronavirus, and noted that lenders are already pulling back over default concerns. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee, is working on his own proposal related to merger reviews during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a person familiar with his plans. FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, previously called on Congress to relax the waiting periods to allow the agencies more time. “During a national emergency, corporations shouldn't be able to dictate how government is using its limited resources,” Chopra said Wednesday on Twitter. “Corporations shouldn't be able to slip big mergers through during national emergencies. Congress should stop the shot clock so public servants have enough time to investigate and sue to block bad deals.” Republican FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson said the agency is working with companies to request extensions. “@FTC is seeking more time to ensure full review of pending deals. It will not sacrifice thoroughness of investigations that may require information from third parties focused on other priorities,” she said on Twitter. The proposal viewed by POLITICO would extend the statute of limitations on price-fixing and bid-rigging cases for at least six months because of the pandemic. Price-fixing cases have a five-year statute of limitations, so prosecutors are pushing against the clock on conduct that took place in 2015, said Lisa Phelan, a partner at Morrison & Foerster. “A delay of more than a few weeks could really risk things slipping away,” said Phelan, who worked on criminal antitrust cases at DOJ for 25 years. In general, most companies and individuals involved in price-fixing schemes agree to plead guilty; at the federal level, 90 percent of cases end with plea bargains. Toward the end of investigations, though, prosecutors are faced with the hold-outs — companies and individuals who refuse plea deals in favor of trials. In those cases, prosecutors seek indictments, which require empaneling a federal grand jury. “Even if they wanted to go forward with a proceeding, that’s not going to be possible,” said Ann O’Brien, who left the antitrust division last month after 20 years and is now a partner at Baker Hostetler. “They are not going to bring in a quorum of grand jurors to be in a small room.” One major case pending at the antitrust division is its long-running probe into price-fixing among generic pharmaceutical companies. So far, three companies — Sandoz, Rising Pharmaceuticals and Heritage Pharmaceuticals — have been charged and entered into deferred-prosecution settlements with prosecutors. Three executives have also pleaded guilty. Last month, prosecutors brought an indictment against former Taro executive Ara Aprahamian, who plans to contest the charges. Teva and Sun Pharmaceuticals, who are among the world’s largest generics manufacturers, have acknowledged involvement in the probe but haven’t reached resolutions with prosecutors. While the DOJ’s attorneys are based in D.C., the grand jury for the investigation is in the federal court in Philadelphia, which suspended all grand juries on Wednesday. A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.","DOJ wants more time on merger reviews, price-fixing cases because of pandemic",2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-merger-reviews-coronavirus-140669,politico
"Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have tested negative for the coronavirus, the vice president’s office announced Saturday.   “Pleased to report that the COVID-19 test results came back negative for both Vice President @Mike_Pence and Second Lady @KarenPence,"" Katie Miller, Pence’s press secretary, tweeted. The Pences were tested for coronavirus on Saturday afternoon, a day after one of the vice president's staffers tested positive for the infection.  Earlier, Pence said there was ""no reason to believe"" he or his wife were exposed to the virus. But he said he will get tested because of his sensitive role in the Trump administration.  Pence made the comments at a Saturday afternoon press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic alongside President Donald Trump.  ""We've done all contact tracing and while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon,"" Pence said.  The White House learned on Friday that a member of Pence's staff had tested positive for the coronavirus. Pence said the staffer ""had mild cold-like symptoms"" for about a day and a half but is ""doing well."" ""He has not been to the White House since Monday,"" Pence added. ""Neither the president nor I had direct contact with that staff person."" Trump took a test for the coronavirus last week, which the White House said was negative.  During his remarks on Saturday, Pence said 195,000 Americans have been tested for the coronavirus, a total that does not include tests done at county hospitals or health care labs. Of those tests, 19,343 came back positive, Pence said. Both numbers are expected to jump in the coming days as testing becomes more available. Almost 300 people in the U.S. have died form the disease thus far, according to researchers.  In an effort to slow the number of new coronavirus cases, the Trump administration has urged people to avoid groups larger than 10 people. Many theaters, restaurants, theme parks have shuttered and millions of people have shifted to remote work if possible. Churches and other places of worship have also taken their services online. Pence urged church-goers to continue donating to religious institutions, regardless of whether they can attend in person.  ""One thing the president and I promised was to remind people that on the weekends that you're not in the pews, it's still a good — it's still a good idea to, if you can, to go ahead and make that donation.

"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — As Florida officials move to expel the hundreds of thousands of spring breakers who ignored calls for social distancing, public-health specialists are nervously wondering what will happen once the party’s over. For much of this week, revelers continued to cram four and five to a hotel room, swarm beaches over hundreds of miles of coastline, and then gather shoulder-to-shoulder in bars and clubs – almost a model process for spreading contagious diseases.  Now, with their campuses likely shuttered, most spring breakers will return to hometowns across the country where any exposure to coronavirus could set off a contagion, public-health experts warned. They called for greater vigilance in those communities and sharply criticized Florida authorities for their slowness in closing beaches and nightspots. “What is happening in Florida with spring break partying-on by students oblivious to the epidemiological implications of their actions is nothing short of tragic,” wrote Gregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, in an email. “While many of us have been hunkering down to try to break the chains of infection in our communities, these young people have decided the pleasures of the moment are worth bringing back the coronavirus to their friends and family.”  Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the crush of swimsuit-clad students consuming large amounts of alcohol could create so-called “super-spreading events” that worsen the pandemic. “The students who are going and partying at spring break potentially are feeding into a world where they are stuck in their houses for weeks on end later on,” he said. “So I think they should keep that in mind."" There is some precedent for resort communities being slow to wake up to epidemics. The Austrian village of Ischgl, an Alpine ski destination and party hotspot, was slow to close down its establishments even as other nations issued travel warnings of potential coronavirus exposure. Thousands of revelers returning from vacations in Ischgl spread infections across much of Scandinavia. On Tuesday, Norway said 40 percent of its then-1,400 infections were traced to Ischgl. The outbreak has prompted accusations that authorities there acted too slowly out of a fear of harming the local tourist economy. Unlike other states, Florida did not initially impose strict controls on crowds and left it up to local officials to take action.  On Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars and nightclubs to close for 30 days and directed restaurants to cut their seating capacity by half. That same day he said that beaches could remain open but that groups of more than 10 people would not be allowed in one place. The edict wasn’t enforced. Aerial pictures of hundreds of thousands of beachgoers hit the national airwaves and shocked people in other states where even major thoroughfares were empty. Forced to explain his decision, DeSantis said he did not want to do a statewide order because there were places where the virus had not yet spread. People were on “edge,” he said, and he wanted them to be able to go outside. Some local officials stepped in. Those in Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Naples and Clearwater moved to shut their beaches down. On Friday, DeSantis ordered restaurants to shut their doors, except for takeout and delivery. He told gyms to shutter and closed the beaches and other “non-essential” businesses in Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach at the urging of local officials. This action came a day after Miami officials closed many businesses. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber told POLITICO on Friday that the city is finally getting spring breakers to leave after a month of revelry. Gelber ordered beaches shut on Thursday, and posted photos of the empty sandscape on Facebook on Friday.  Hotels will “substantially close” by Monday evening, Gelber announced in a late-Friday tweet. Gelber predicted the measures would reduce the transmission of coronavirus but, at this point, he didn’t know how much. Florida spring break went on for weeks before anyone took action, when the virus seemed less threatening.  “This is about risk management,” Gelber said. “It might have been too late a month ago, frankly.” Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said there have been no confirmed spring break coronavirus cases reported in the city. But Hansel Tookes, a public-health physician specializing in infectious diseases at University of Miami’s medical school, said no one knows how much the coronavirus has spread among spring breakers because of a lack of testing. Had there been enough tests, the students could have gone to clinics, and the sick ones could have isolated themselves in Florida before going home. “If there was testing, they could be isolated in say, a hotel or a place where they could remain alone until they were no longer infectious,” he said. “Younger people have more social interactions. There’s more transmission amongst them. Most people are infectious before they are symptomatic.” Indeed, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have found that the virus also spreads quickly even among people who are asymptomatic. Ten percent of patients are infected by someone who has no symptoms. So far, there’s no sign of a spring break surge in Florida's safety net hospitals, which would potentially be more likely to take in a struggling spring breaker. But it’s also too early. Infected Florida spring breakers are still incubating the illness, spreading the disease. And, state officials don’t know if there will be a surge in other parts of the country because they’re not tracking anyone who has left Florida without symptoms.  “There’s the strong possibility that we could start to see cases popping up after the incubation period. And if it’s not the spring breakers, their parents and grandparents are at high risk as well,” said Nitesh Paryani, an oncologist in Lakeland, who said his cancer specialty doesn't mean anything amid the public health crisis. “Everybody is treating coronavirus, whether we want to or not. All physicians are being pulled into this fight. It’s an all hands on deck situation.” Ironically, the risk of returning spring breakers carrying the virus has already manifested itself in Florida. In the city of Gainesville, home to the University of Florida, four students have tested positive. One of the students had returned from Portugal while on spring break, according to local media. The Gainesville Sun reported that one student was a dentistry student who worked in a clinic after returning. The revelation that there was positive tests among university students played into the university system’s decision to scrap in-person classes for the rest of the semester. Initially, schools planned to delay opening campuses after spring break and resume classes in early April. DeSantis admonished university students this week for returning to fraternity houses to party instead of going home. Florida State University President John Thrasher, whose college was on spring break this past week, said that he is hopeful that many of the school’s 41,000 plus students will stay away, even those who live off-campus locally. “We are doing everything we can to discourage them from going back,” Thrasher said. But while Florida schools contribute to the spring break crowds, students also stream in from the rest of the South and even the Midwest. And it’s not quite clear how many came to the state – and where they are going now that the bars, restaurants and many of the beaches have shut down. “I would think it next to impossible to track that many people and potential exposures,” said Craig Fugate, the former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who also led Florida’s emergency management agency when the state dealt with back-to-back hurricanes. “This may end up being tracked by spring breakers if they get sick here or once they get home and working backwards.” Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing arm, does not have figures for this year, but says that more than 32 million visitors come to the state in March through May. An average of 2.7 million students come to Florida each year, the group estimates.  DeSantis acknowledged Thursday — at the opening of a South Florida mobile testing site — the unintended consequences of a March 11 directive that he and the State University System Board of Governors worked together on. They told students to delay returning to campus from spring break for two weeks.  “We were thinking, don’t come back yet,” DeSantis said. “Instead, they all went back, and they were drinking at the bars every night.” Despite the clear risks, experts said that several factors might mitigate the threat posed by the spring breakers. “It certainly has the potential to cause spread, but it may not be as dramatic as some people might think,"" said Lessler, the Johns Hopkins professor. Young people are more likely to be asymptomatic, and might therefore be less contagious, he said. Lessler also cited the short duration of spring break, which lasts about a week for most revelers. The generation time of the virus ranges from four to eight days, weighted towards the higher end, he said. That means that infected spring breakers could spread the virus to one other person, but there might not be enough time to pass the virus on again before heading home.  Still, all public-health officials who were interviewed warned that returning spring breakers could easily bring the virus to new parts of the country, as the disease continues its relentless spread. “Students on spring break are likely to introduce [coronavirus] into communities that have not yet been exposed to the virus, especially in quieter less well-connected parts of the country,” said William Hanage, professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an emailed statement. “However this does not change the fact that the virus is well established and community transmission is widespread. Once this has happened, limits on travel become much less important.”",Will spring breakers become super-spreaders?,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/spring-breakers-coronavirus-140609,politico
"Senate Republicans and Democrats have yet to reach an overall deal on a massive economic rescue package in response to the coronavirus crisis — but the two sides are getting closer. And Senate GOP leaders said Saturday they will press ahead with drafting portions of the bill, which will cost at least $1.6 trillion, according to three GOP sources. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remains adamant about sticking to a Monday deadline to hold a final vote on the legislation, the most expensive economic rescue package in U.S. history. McConnell has set up a critical procedural vote for Sunday afternoon, and he will need Democratic support to continue moving forward. McConnell late Saturday evening said the Senate is ""poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands"" and is instructing committee chairmen to draft final legislative text. A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) cautioned there is no agreement yet and that Democrats have yet to see several parts of the Republican draft.  ""We look forward to reviewing their first draft and negotiating a bipartisan compromise,"" the spokesperson said.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, McConnell, Schumer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will meet in McConnell's office Sunday at 11 a.m. to discuss the legislation. But there is still no guarantee a deal will be reached. A senior Democratic aide said Saturday evening that ""Republicans abruptly pulled out of negotiations for reasons Democrats still don’t understand."" A GOP official involved in the negotiations countered that Republicans have conceded to Democratic demands on key issues and that it's time to meet McConnell’s time frame.  The two sides continue to squabble over boosting paid leave for sick workers and those caring for infected family members — a major issue for Democrats — as well as what kind of financial help the federal government can provide to distressed industries, such as the major U.S. airlines. The White House and Senate Republicans want several hundred billion dollars for impacted industries, said officials involved in the talks.  But there was significant progress during Saturday's negotiations on boosting unemployment insurance payments, a major source of contention between GOP and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans have agreed to boost those payments by $250 billion, a major win for Democrats, said two sources familiar with the discussions. This will come on top of $250 billion in direct payments from the IRS to individual Americans, which President Donald Trump, Mnuchin and Senate Republicans have made their key priority. And Senate GOP leaders and the White House conceded to a Democratic demand for tens of billions of dollars for hospitals and health-care providers as part of the rescue package. There also appears to be broad support for $350 billion in loans to small and medium-sides businesses that have been decimated as the U.S. economy grinds to a jarring halt in the facing of the growing coronavirus outbreak.  “What [McConnell] has instructed his committees to do is to finish drafting legislation that reflects agreements reached so far, and where the chairmen and the majority believe Democrats could be in a position to support by the time the vote occurs,” said White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland, a key Trump administration official involved in the high-level talks. “It’s critically important that Congress be in a position to act for the American people and the American economy on Monday.”  McConnell was hopeful about the prospects for an agreement, telling reporters: “I think we’re clearly going to get there.” “Basically, we know the general contours of what this is going to look like,” added Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), as he left a closed-door GOP luncheon earlier in the day. Now it’s just a question of plugging in some of the policy, and figuring out where the numbers are.” “The Democrats are getting some of the things they’ve asked for,” said Thune, ticking off priorities like immediate relief to individuals, protections for health care workers, and shoring up small businesses. “They’re getting what they wanted on unemployment insurance.” Senate Democrats have been tight-lipped about specific issues but generally said Republicans were making good-faith offers as they attempt to reach agreement. “We’ve reached a point where the big issues — the really big important issues — are just interrelated, and we can make progress,” added Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of his party’s top negotiators on financial issues. In a sign that negotiations were reaching a critical point, Pelosi spent part of Saturday flying back to D.C. Mnuchin spoke with Pelosi and Schumer during the afternoon. ""We're making very good progress. I'm optimistic we can make a deal,"" Schumer said late Saturday afternoon. McConnell had originally demanded an agreement be reached by Saturday afternoon. Mnuchin declined to comment on the talks, but told reporters that he's also spoken with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. ""Everybody's working very hard,"" Mnuchin said just before 4 p.m. on Saturday. Senate Republicans earlier tried to break the deadlock by delivering their latest concession to Democrats on one of the biggest remaining issues — $250 billion more for unemployment insurance payments. The two sides huddled separately as they sought a way to incorporate the Democratic demands, such as longer-term benefits for furloughed workers. ""We have a good bipartisan agreement on enhanced unemployment compensations,"" said Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). As negotiations moved forward, the size and scope of the package appeared to steadily increase. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said earlier Saturday that the price tag of the legislation was expected to exceed $1.3 trillion, and that the total size of the package, including loans from the federal government, would likely exceed 10 percent of GDP — roughly $2 trillion. That would include a payroll tax holiday for small businesses.  During a Senate GOP lunch, Republicans discussed an idea from the Trump administration for possible specific assistance for General Electric and Boeing, but several pushed back on it, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Cruz later tweeted his opposition to ""a special carve-out"" for the two companies, adding, ""Millions are losing jobs; we don’t need bailouts or corporate welfare—those companies should participate in the same liquidity programs as everyone else."" Inside the Trump administration, there is a strong desire to help both Boeing and GE, a major contributor to the Boeing supply chain. Both companies employ tens of thousands of workers, and the administration wants to prevent any major loss of jobs at the iconic firms. In addition to providing the companies money or loans directly through the ""Phase 3"" package, Mnuchin is also trying to ensure the legislation gives both Treasury and the Federal Reserve the flexibility to loan the two companies additional funds, according to three sources familiar with the Hill negotiations. Another issue still under negotiation is the Democrats' call for a ""State Stabilization Fund,"" which would assist state governments with looming revenue shortfalls during the pandemic. Democrats are optimistic about their ask on aid to states. In a tweet, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Saturday that Republicans are now negotiating on the terms and amount of funding. The debate over expanding paid leave may be the toughest remaining point of conflict. The Senate pushed through the House's ""Phase 2"" relief package earlier this week which included new paid sick leave provisions. While the Senate approved the measure in a 90-8 vote, McConnell had to convince his caucus to support it and vowed to address shortcomings in this new, third stimulus package. The discussions come after Senate Republicans introduced a $1 trillion measure Thursday to salvage the economy by providing assistance to individuals, small businesses and industries. Under the GOP proposal, individuals and families would receive $1,200 and $2,400 in direct cash payments based on their income. But some Republicans, including Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), complained the proposal's structure — as written — would penalize lower income Americans who do not have a taxable income. Republican lawmakers and aides say this has been resolved.

"President Donald Trump is always keeping score. Sometimes it's a simple brag — boasting about the highest State of the Union TV ratings in history, trumpeting that he appointed more judges than George Washington, inflating the number of electoral college votes he won in 2016. But cherry-picked numbers are also central to how Trump comprehends a crisis and crafts a positive narrative. As the coronavirus raced around the globe and seized the world’s economy, he has cited numbers to suit his own story that the pandemic would quickly pass and that his administration was in control.  It’s a playbook that hasn’t always worked. In late February, Trump claimed there were only 15 coronavirus cases in the United States — a vast understatement — and promised “within a couple of days,” the number would be close to zero. That number has now soared past 14,000 and is climbing exponentially. He seized on figures about how many people the seasonal flu killed annually — 37,000 last year alone — without the country needing to shutter most businesses. His own health officials categorically rejected the comparison.  Then, Trump promised the administration would have 1.4 million coronavirus tests available by mid-March. But as of Saturday, only 195,000 people had been tested, even as the administration has met its goals of providing tests. One of the president’s top infectious disease experts to conceded, “Clearly, more needs to be done,” but vowed that officials were “rapidly getting to the point where we will have many, many tests out there available for virtually everyone.” Public health specialists say Trump’s use of misleading numbers to downplay the coronavirus outbreak — a challenge that could make-or-break his presidency — has had dangerous consequences, leading Americans to ignore official warnings about modifying behaviors to slow the disease’s spread.  “He's a man that hears what he wants to hears … and he puts it through the lens of a marketer. He is a marketer,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “His image is, ‘I’m on top of this, I’m tough,’ and anything he hears that supports that theory of the case, he grabs and utilizes.” Those around Trump disagree. They say his numbers-focused mindset is a crisis asset. Trump’s specific obsession with the number of coronavirus cases is the right approach, argued former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who made headlines when he insisted — wrongly — that Trump had drawn the largest ever inaugural crowd. “Having a metric-based business mentality is what you need during periods of crisis,” said Spicer, who visited the White House at least twice this week. “Either people are getting better and it’s being contained or it’s not. It’s the only judge of success.” More broadly, Trump’s team thinks the numbers are in his favor, arguing the administration started taking action the first week of January. Since then, Trump has up a task force, declared a public health emergency, requested billions from Congress and announced early restrictions on travel from China. Trump aides also note the administration has facilitated the shipments of test kits to U.S. and foreign labs.  For years, Trump has been obsessed with records, ratings and statistics, mentioning them constantly — and often inflating the figures, failing to acknowledge the human aspect or overhyping his own role. There’s interest rates and unemployment rates, crowd sizes and polls, stock markets gains and immigrant apprehension numbers. Before running for office in 2016, Trump had spent his five decades in the real estate, marketing and reality TV businesses. He sold himself to voters on that background, touting his ability to strike deals with countries and companies alike.  Once in office, he talked about policy moves like one-off deals, often becoming preoccupied with certain figures. For example, he has constantly complained about trade deficits — when the value of what the country imports exceeds its exports — spouting off the amount with each country. $500 billion a year with China, $100 billion with Japan, $17 billion with Canada.  When Trump has struck new deals with China, Mexico and Canada and others, he’s always noted how much the agreement will reduce each trade deficit.  “When you’re in the real investment business, the performance is only based on numbers and that’s all that matters,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “He spent a lifetime on it. He’s not going to think differently now. That’s how you judge real estate. That’s all they have. It’s all about the money.” But Trump has been accused of forgetting the people behind the numbers. In August, Trump touted the crowd size of a rally — held at the same time as an event of then Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke —- while visiting medical staff who had treated victims of a mass shooting.  That criticism has resurfaced during the coronavirus pandemic. During the early stages of the outbreak, Trump mused about keeping coronavirus-infected passengers aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship in the waters off California to keep down the number of U.S. cases.  “I like the numbers being where they are,” he said. “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” Michael Caputo, who has known Trump for three decades and served as a campaign adviser in 2016, acknowledged Trump can be accused of being unfeeling, but compared it to how a statistician or economist might be criticised for being too focused on numbers and not people. But Caputo argued Trump has changed his approach as president.  “That’s part of the learning curve,” he said. “He has embraced the human side.” Caputo said toying with numbers is how Trump processes his options and reveals his thinking. “When global society is melting around him, he leans back on what he knows. Data is what he knows,” he said. “He muses, thinking aloud. My experience with the president he verbalizes all the options on the table and discusses every piece of data.” Trump’s political fixation on favorable figures goes back to his campaign. While on the campaign trail, Trump often talked about having a statistician he frequently called to get numbers about whatever he wanted. “You know, I have a person. He's a statistician. He's so excited by his job. He loves it,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M., in May. “I do like details and I do like statisticians,” he said at a Sacramento rally the following month. There was even a rally where he held up charts to illustrate what he said were the failures of President Barack Obama and his secretary of State, Hillary Clinton — Trump’s rival. There were charts on homeownership rates, the national debt, Syrian refugees entering the U.S., commuted prison sentences as well as hedge fund managers-turned Clinton campaign contributors and foreign donations to the Clinton family foundation. Trump’s rallies have continued during his presidency — until coronavirus, that is. And certain figures have become a recurring part of his stump speech.  He describes the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates are the lowest rate in history, though they have risen again. He claims seven million people have joined the workforce since he’s been president, though the gains are lower than Obama’s final three years. He said his administration has built 100 miles of new wall along the southern border, though most of that was simply upgrading existing sections. And he always talks about his 2016 electoral college vote total — which was 304, not 306 — without noting that Clinton won the popular vote.  “We were not supposed to crack 220, you know that, right?” Trump told a crowd in February 2017. “There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270.” Trump still talks about crowd sizes, boasting about the “record” numbers who have attended or watched from outdoor jumbo screens at the nearly 100 rallies he’s held as president. This less-consequential braggadocio has also surfaced during his near-daily coronavirus briefings.  On Sunday, Trump touted a stock market surge that occurred late Friday after he declared a national emergency to free up funds to combat the coronavirus.  “It went up 2,000 — almost 2,000 points,” he said. He wasn’t wrong, but by Monday the stock market plummeted again amid reports Trump had inflated the progress made fighting the virus — another fallout from his reliance on misleading figures during the coronavirus crisis.  An outside Trump adviser said Trump feels the need to offer up his record because he needs to justify himself against what he sees as the constant media attacks. “Numbers matter,” the person said. “That’s how you judge the status of things. Numbers don’t lie. Numbers give you benchmarks to achieve.” But the adviser acknowledged Trump can go too far in his language, attributing that to Trump being from New York. He even had a number to express his thoughts: “I wish he said two-thirds less of the things he did.”",Trump has scoreboard obsession.

"Before the three weeks that miraculously brought Joe Biden to the cusp of the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign was limping along — and Biden knows it. “The press kept saying Biden has no money, and they were right,” the former vice president said during Sunday’s Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders. “Biden had no money.” And new campaign finance disclosures filed late Friday highlight how Biden captured the Democratic nomination on momentum and message instead of organizational prowess — and the work his operation has to do to build up for a grueling general election campaign against President Donald Trump. Biden, who brought in $18.1 million in February, was outraised by four other Democratic presidential contenders that month: Bernie Sanders ($47.7 million), Elizabeth Warren ($29.5 million), Amy Klobuchar ($18.7 million) and Pete Buttigieg ($18.6 million). While Biden’s fundraising took off in March as he started reeling off primary wins, his campaign operation lagged well behind others’. Sanders had 1,215 people on the payroll in February, according to his campaign finance report, while Warren paid salaries to 1,203 different staffers. Buttigieg had over 550 people on his campaign at that point.  Meanwhile, Biden’s payroll stood at 477, as his lower fundraising totals throughout 2019 and early 2020 meant his campaign had to try to keep costs low. Sanders outspent Biden $46 million to $13 million in February — and still finished the month with more cash in the bank, $18.7 million to $12.1 million. “As is typical, [Biden]’s got to pull in talent from other campaigns and across the party to run a general election, and he’s got to move quickly,” said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who served as deputy campaign manager for former President Barack Obama in 2012. “He just needs more of everything.” Lying in wait is Trump’s reelection campaign, which has been preparing for the general election for years and already has more than $94 million socked away in its bank account. The Republican National Committee has also built a big financial advantage over the Democratic National Committee that even a big windfall from billionaire Mike Bloomberg can’t erase. The DNC ended February with $14.1 million on hand, compared to $76.8 million for the RNC. Biden’s retooling process is already underway, with another former Obama hand, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, taking over as Biden’s campaign manager last week. But the coronavirus pandemic and the sudden onset of social distancing and remote work from home may impair the Biden campaign’s buildup. “The lack of infrastructure in the states was a reflection of the limited resources available at that time, and now, that will all change,” said Tom McMahon, a former DNC executive director.  “They may be playing catch up but in light of how campaigning will take place going forward they aren’t necessarily at a disadvantage,” McMahon continued. “The real challenge they’re going to have to face going forward is putting together a comprehensive campaign remotely.”  Biden will have the cash to try: He revealed during last Sunday’s debate that he had raised $33 million in the first half of March, and that was before he swept the primaries on March 17 and padded his delegate lead over Sanders. Even before he started raising such large amounts of money, Biden’s other strengths were ultimately more important than the power of an organization during the primary, said Matt Paul, a former aide to Hillary Clinton and former Agriculture secretary and Iowa governor Tom Vilsack.  “But it’s a different game now,” Paul continued, “and they know that. This break in the campaign is bizarre, but it’s an opportunity to think very carefully and plan very carefully about how to marshal their resources.”",'He just needs more of everything': Biden campaign faces retool after primary surge,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/joe-biden-fec-fundraising-140262,politico
"ELY, Minn. -- At the edge of a vast wilderness ringed by lakes and woods, a surprise discovery provided a rare jolt of optimism for a struggling mining town now known mainly as a prime destination for canoers: Massive deposits of nickel and copper -- minerals that power car batteries and smart phones -- lie under the earth. Many jubilant residents of Ely and nearby towns are now hanging their hopes on a plan to build a massive mining facility under a patch of national forest land that’s a stone’s throw from one of the most verdant watersheds in the world. But the project increases the risk of acidic waste contaminating the area’s lakes and streams. Environmental groups mounted a well-funded push against the project. Democratic presidential contenders began objecting, too: Bernie Sanders, Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren pledged to stop the project. Joe Biden has yet to take a position.  And that’s forced people in Ely and Minnesota’s Iron Range region to think again about who are its protectors and defenders. A place that once gave Democratic native sons Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale 4:1 voting margins and considers the late Sen. Paul Wellstone a local hero has begun to embrace a president who bears little resemblance to them, except that he reversed the “injustice” of an Obama-era order that would have brought the nickel-copper project to a 20-year standstill. On top of that were the 25 percent tariffs Trump imposed on most foreign steel, which provided an initial boost to the 5,000 miners still employed in the region’s numerous iron-ore mines that have served as the backbone to the region’s economy. All of that put Ely in the middle of a political transformation that makes Minnesota the president’s top target among states he lost in 2016, and potentially a pivot point in the 2020 presidential race. Trump lost the state by a margin of 45,000 votes in 2016, a remarkable feat considering how entrenched Democrats have been in the state. “The Iron Range is back in business,” Trump declared in a speech in Minneapolis last October. The area's growing affinity toward Trump provides a case study in how the president has brought the blue-collar vote to heel with a mix of culture and economic promise. But not everyone is willing to cede the town and region to the Republicans. Even some who like Trump’s mining policies chafe at his harsh rhetoric. Still others express concern about the threat to local waterways and wilderness. But all agree that the economic changes looming over the area created a mixed-up political stew in which Trumpism floated most easily to the top. “The hope rested with Trump, that’s where the people went … it’s hope. People want hope for a better future,” said Ely Mayor Chuck Novak, a self-described Humphrey Democrat who has thrown his support behind the president winning a second term. He is an ardent supporter of the new mining project. “This is the old method of politics,” he added. “You take care of your economy and your people.” *** Fifty miles west along the Iron Range, in the mining towns where empty storefronts outnumber the bars, banks and pizza joints, labor unions are grappling with a new political reality.  Every time Chris Johnson gathers his United Steelworkers Local 2705 at the hall in Chisholm, Minn., the union of roughly 600 mine workers that pull iron ore out of the Hibbing Taconite mine have one question: Why isn’t their leadership going all in on Trump? It’s a question Johnson, once a mine worker himself and now the local president, struggles to answer to his rank and file. He strongly supports nickel-copper mining but can’t overcome decades of Democratic support that led him to embrace Wellstone, Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken and other liberal heroes. Trump’s “not pro-labor and that’s the only message we really have for them,” he said. “He basically stole the union’s message and is using that, but to his core he doesn’t believe any of the stuff we do, but he knows he’s getting votes for it.” Johnson estimates that about 75 percent of his membership supports Trump.  Trump’s appeal to the “forgotten people” has resonated with a population that has seen the iron-ore mining industry go through decades of boom-bust cycles that have led to mass layoffs, a declining population and a growing sense of survivalism. In the late 1970s the industry employed 15,000 people. That’s down to roughly 5,000. The area never recovered those mining jobs after mass layoffs in 1981 as the U.S. steel industry underwent changes and automation took hold. The environmental priorities of Democrats at a national and state level are shifting support in places like the Iron Range, where even pro-labor members feel increasingly alienated by a platform more suited to a political party that is rapidly becoming more urbanized. Johnson recounted a meeting last year in Washington with Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minneapolis. He said the lawmaker told him the way of life in the Iron Range is going to change. “We’re a vital part of all products made in this country and abroad and for her to just sit there and say, ‘look you guys are going to have to learn a different industry’ doesn’t go over well,” he said. “I’ve voted Democrat my whole life. It’s getting tougher,” said Steve Bonach, president of United Steelworkers Local 1938, the union for the roughly 1,200 workers at the area’s largest mine. He said he’s leaning towards supporting Bernie Sanders. “I wish I could put my hand on the transformation going on around here,” he said from his union hall in Virginia, Minn., a building wrapped in a mural of military men and women in uniform. St. Louis County, which includes Ely, lost 20,000 people between 1980 and 1990. The county, which also encompasses the lake port city of Duluth, has not really seen its population rebound since that time. David Bednarczak, a county employee who was laid off from a mining job in 1981, said he can’t vote for Trump because of his views on immigrants and women, but recognizes that the pull of the Democratic party is waning in the area. He was the sole person from his voting precinct in Hibbing to show up to a late-February caucus night for the Democrats, known in Minnesota as the Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party. A paltry crowd of 35 people representing 10 precincts in a city of 16,000 showed up to the event. “We lost our future, we lost our enthusiasm for living. We lost that vibrant group of young people that participated in the economy,” said Bednarczak, who was supporting Sanders. “We’ve never really recovered, not in population and not in economy.” While the Iron Range declined, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul prospered, leaving some to think that the Democratic party could soon cut its losses here.  The challenge of maintaining Democratic support of rural and small-town voters that value gun rights and resource-intensive industries has grown even more difficult. That’s even harder in an area where miners can make anywhere between $80,000 to $100,000 per year. The industry claims each direct mining jobs supports at least two more indirect jobs. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, mine workers in the area had enjoyed some clear benefits from economic growth in the Trump era. Overall employment in St. Louis County grew by only 0.7 percent from the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 (the most recent data available), compared to 4.2 percent growth in natural resources and mining employment in the county. But wages in natural resources and mining increased a robust 31 percent in the county, compared with 5 percent wage growth across all of Minnesota.  “When you get some of the radicals in the state Democratic party trying to push the environmental agenda a little too far, that’s when people are going to push back,” said John Lamusga, a salaried mine worker who supported Trump in the last election. He called Bill Clinton a good president and lauded Wellstone as a “a great human being” but said people are just tired of establishment politicians. “I think most people voted for Trump definitely not because he was going to be an angel in office, and not because they thought he was going to be a savior,” he said, sipping a beer after a curling match at the Hibbing Curling Club. “I think most people voted for Trump up here because they were pretty fed up with the political establishment on both sides.” *** Talk of economic diversification in the Iron Range is usually met with a shake of the head and shrug of shoulders. No one’s betting on the area becoming a tech hub or even a center for non-mining manufacturing. Even local leaders concede that pulling minerals out of the land is what people do here. Iron ore was discovered in the area in the mid-1800s. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Scandinavia came to the region in waves to work in the growing mines. Eventually the soft, high-grade ore found near the surface was exhausted and miners began blasting deeper and deeper to extract taconite, a lower-grade ore that is turned into pellets and carried by trains to ports on Lake Superior where it is shipped to steel-making plants in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. But the industry is continuing to change. Some of the open pit mines where the ore is extracted are beginning to see deposits run thin. The steel industry is also evolving as companies invest in new methods to make the metal, shifting from blast furnaces that rely on the area’s taconite ore to newer electric arc furnaces that primarily melt scrap to make new steel.  United States Steel Corp. announced late last year that it will shutter its Great Lakes Works blast furnace operation near Detroit, laying off more than 1,500 workers. U.S. Steel operates the largest mining operation in the Iron Range. The uncertain fate of the iron-ore industry is fueling the debate over nickel-copper mining that permeates conversations along the entire range.  Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the Chilean mining giant Antofagasta, is proposing mining an area of Superior National Forest for nickel, copper and potentially other minerals. “That’s how you diversify the economy here. It’s going to be mineral-based,” said Bob Vlaisavljevich, mayor of nearby Eveleth, Minn. “If copper is down, you’ve got three other minerals. That’s where you get those dips, not the peaks and valleys where people are losing their homes, moving away. As far as diversification, that’s how it’s going to be.” The Twin Metals company said the 100-acre site won’t pose the environmental risk that people fear. The company insists its method of processing the mine waste won’t jeopardize the surrounding lakes and waterway. Proponents point to an underground nickel-copper mine in operation in Michigan’s upper peninsula as a model for the industry in northern Minnesota. Environmentalists insist otherwise. They say the nickel-copper mining process, no matter how technologically advanced, will risk leaching sulfuric acid, heavy metals and sulfates into the surrounding watershed. A statewide poll released last month showed that a majority of Minnesotans opposed the project near Ely. “Our communities have built our way of life around the wilderness. This poll makes clear that the majority of Minnesotans stand with us in protecting our nation’s greatest canoe country wilderness,” said Becky Rom, national chair of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. Nonetheless, the Twin Metals project, still in the planning and permitting phase, is estimated to directly employ 700 people and create 1,400 spinoff jobs for the area. And it isn’t the only nickel-copper project in the area. A mining company called PolyMet has gotten all of its permits for a similar mine in nearby Hoyt Lakes, Minn., but the project is tied up in complex litigation. Trump’s steel tariffs and protective trade policies have only left a region long dependent on mining here wanting even more. The president imposed a 25 percent tariff on most imported steel in 2018, but most people don’t highlight the policy as the saving grace Trump touts it to be. While steel prices initially shot up, they’ve settled back down as the U.S. steel industry continues to undergo a somewhat painful transformation. “There’s sure no boom up here,” said Gary Skalko. After nine terms as mayor of the town of Mountain Iron, Minn., the self-described “hippie” and former school teacher is standing down. He’s a strong supporter of the mining industry, but he senses a change in culture. “I’m a pro-choice guy. I’m still worried about losing my First Amendment rights, not my Second Amendment rights. I felt [Trump] should have been convicted for what he did,” he said. “Why would I represent people who don’t have the same values? There’s so much hatred on both sides.” Preserving “our way of life” has become a rallying cry in the region. Rep. Pete Stauber, a former Duluth police officer who once played professional hockey, flipped the area’s eighth congressional district to red in the 2018 midterm. He used the phrase in his campaign. Stauber is “not running a political campaign, he’s running a cultural campaign and it’s invincible as far as I’m concerned,” said Aaron Brown, a fifth generation Iron Ranger who teaches at Hibbing Community College and writes commentary on local issues.  It all comes down to a cultural balance that remains undecided and “almost a sense of inferiority that comes from an up and down economy,” he said. “Presidents have come and gone. Clinton and Bush and Obama and now Trump,” said Brown. “Very different policies but this place hasn’t changed that much, and I think there’s something about the hollowing out of the industrialization of this area that we feel that we no longer have any control over our self-destiny and I think that just feeds into our politics.” * * * The same downturns in open pit mining and the U.S. steel industry that are fueling the support for nickel and copper mining have provoked skepticism in some other Iron Range residents – those who have started to think about the area’s natural beauty as a resource that can be monetized. And natural beauty, unlike mineral deposits, never gets tapped out. Sue Schurke looks at the economy differently than most of her neighbors. Her house overlooks a lake that sits downstream from the proposed Twin Metals nickel and copper mine. Schurke and her husband Paul have benefitted from the natural richness of the area. She employs nine people that design and manufacture outerwear. The couple has also operated a dogsled lodge since the 1980s where they own a pack of 60 friendly but hyperactive Inuit sled dogs brought in from northern Canada.  “Ely is not a dying town,” she said, countering the argument that the tourism economy can’t sustain the town. “I have a manufacturing business and there’s room for lots of good businesses in this town that are sustainable.” Ely sits at the gateway of the million-acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area, a wilderness of lakes and forest that stretches to the Canadian border. The last iron-ore operation in the town, the underground Pioneer Mine, closed in 1967. In succeeding decades, the population has become a hybrid of people who still work at mines in nearby towns and those who have migrated to the area to take advantage of the outdoor recreation economy. Paul Schurke said pro-mining advocates in town are being “hoodwinked.” “If they score the permits, they'll sit on them until the market improves and until expensive mining manpower has been replaced by robotics,” he said. “I empathize with the locals clamoring for high-paying mining jobs, but it's sad to see them being exploited by foreign plutocrats and Trump's populist movement.” In an ironic twist, the Schurkes were invited to the White House in 2018 for the administration’s annual “Made in America” product showcase, where her colorful parkas and jackets caught the eye of Melania Trump. Sue says she has nothing against the iron ore industry that has been here for more than 100 years. Many of her employees come from mining families that support the nickel-copper project. But she fears the impact the new mine might have on her family’s businesses and the environment. “I just feel like Trump came along and just basically opened the door for people,” she said. “Mining is their history … they went with Trump because he was opening the door for it.” Taylor Miller Thomas contributed to this report.",Minnesota on the edge: ‘I’ve voted Democrat my whole life.

"DALLAS — Thousands of people streamed through the church lobby and into the pews. Ushers at First Baptist Dallas invited members to the front rows, gesturing to the prime seats still available. Trumpets blared, bright blue and purple lights illuminated the stage, and behind the orchestra pit the 100 or so members of choir—ranging from late teens to late 60s—stood inches apart, ready to sing for the next 30 minutes. When Robert Jeffress, the senior pastor, walked onto the stage, wearing a dark suit and shiny teal tie, he thanked the musicians.  “Isn’t it great to see so many of them here today?” he asked the audience. Jeffress’ sermon that morning, presented in his usual stoic-but-chipper demeanor, was titled “The Road to Armageddon,” and focused largely on biblical stories of God’s punishments. “God’s judgment is not always immediate,” he told his congregation, and the tens of thousands of people watching online. “But it’s always inevitable.” Aside from a few empty pews in the back of the sanctuary, this seemed like any other Sunday. Except it wasn’t. This was Sunday, March 15. Most of the country was already being reminded to stay at home, to practice social distancing, to flatten the curve of the coronavirus outbreak, which President Donald Trump, the man Jeffress supports at every turn, had just declared a national emergency. Every major sports league had suspended play. The city of Dallas had banned gathering over 500 people and canceled its beloved St. Patrick’s Day parade and party, scheduled for the same weekend. Most ministers, rabbis and imams in North Texas had decided it was safer to share the faith on camera rather than in person. But not Jeffress. On Twitter, the church’s announcement that it would hold live services—there were two that morning—received dozens of replies. Some messages thanked the church. But the vast majority said things like “blood will be on your hands” and “criminally negligent” and “this is foolishness.” Dr. Shelley Conroy, dean of the Louise Herrington School of Nursing at Baylor University—the same university Jeffress attended in the mid-1970s—tweeted: “We should not be putting our elderly members at risk by encouraging them to come to church right now. We should have complied with the intent of the public health orders to keep everyone socially distant for one week to control the spread of this virulent disease.”  Against all these criticisms, the doomsaying and alarming news on television screens and newspaper headlines, Jeffress remained resolute and unmoving. “How do we avoid what I call the pandemic panic?” he told a television station.  “We wanted to have as much normalcy as possible last morning,” he’d explain to me later. But, as we’ve all come to realize, normal could last only so long. Jeffress, 64, is no stranger to controversy. For the past five years, he has been Donald Trump’s most visible, most vocal Evangelical supporter. In addition to leading the 13,000-member megachurch in Dallas, one of the oldest in the country, Jeffress appears regularly on Fox News and Fox Business, excoriating the president’s critics while enthusiastically defending the administration’s policies on everything from child separation at the border to saber rattling on the Korean Peninsula. In the past, he has preached sermons with titles like “Gay Is Not Okay,” he’s called Islam “a false religion based on the teachings of a false prophet,” and he referred to Oprah Winfrey as “a tool of Satan.” (He isn’t afraid to let fly on Republicans, either. Last year, he called Mitt Romney a “self-righteous snake.”) Though he doesn’t mention politics from the pulpit all that often, American flag pins are fairly common in the pews. For more than a century, the church has combined a conservative brand of patriotism with a brimstone-scented piety. Not long after Trump’s inauguration, the First Baptist Dallas choir performed a hymn called “Make America Great Again”—written by the church’s former music director—at a ""Celebrate Freedom"" concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington. I’ve written about Jeffress several times over the past few years. I wanted to know what he was thinking when he decided First Baptist would buck the almost universal cultural retreat that public health officials were promoting. So I called him. Was this a play for publicity, I asked. Jeffress told me he wasn’t trying to court controversy. He said the church was careful not to defy the city’s crowd-size guidelines. Ushers limited the number of people in the main sanctuary to 500, then directed the overflow into other venues on the church’s six-block campus, where attendees could watch a live telecast of the services. Fire marshals were on-site to make sure the church was abiding by the new protocols.  “We have been committed from the very beginning to following the city regulations for meeting together,” Jeffress said. “Those regulations are changing quickly because the situation is changing quickly.” He said he was on a phone call with Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and about 70 other faith leaders earlier last week, before the live service. “Some churches were staying open, some were closing,” he said. “But we were all committed to following the city's guidelines on this.” The city, in its explanation, used the example of a movie theater. “They said a movie theater complex has thousands of people that pass through it during the day, but no more than 500 are gathering in various venues at one time,” Jeffress explained. This was the church’s green light. (Movie theaters in Dallas have since been closed.) Jeffress told me the church also warned that anyone with symptoms and anybody over 60, with any underlying health issue “should really think seriously about not coming, and worshiping with us online.” He said there were a record 166,000 people watching livestreams of the services. I asked Jeffress if he was worried about an outbreak of the virus at his church—where the membership is disproportionately older. He thought about it for a moment. “We made the best decision we could make at that point in time,” he said. “This is a very real threat that we need to take seriously. But the Bible has a great balance between faith and practicality.”  He quoted St. Paul’s second letter to Timothy: “God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love and of a sound mind.” In other words, he said, “God doesn’t want us to be paralyzed with panic, but at the same time he expects us to exercise a sound mind in what we do.” At the end of last Sunday’s sermon, Jeffress told the congregation he was uncertain about what the church would do over the next week. He announced that they would cancel evening service and weekday gatherings. But whether to meet the following Sunday—this Sunday—was still being evaluated. Early this week, the city of Dallas closed down bars and restaurants, except for to-go orders, and told theaters to close. On Monday, Trump suggested keeping gatherings to 10 people or fewer. Soon the virus was detected in all 50 states, and the number of positive tests and deaths looked like they were mirroring the early growth in Italy, where they’re now seeing more than 600 coronavirus deaths a day.  All of these factors played a role in the church’s deliberations. By the time I talked to Jeffress on Thursday, he said he had made its decision for Sunday.  “This will be the first time in the 152-year history of First Baptist Church of Dallas that we will not meet,” he told me.  Sunday, he will stand on stage alone in the sanctuary, with a minimal camera and light crew. He’ll preach to an audience he cannot see and cannot hear. If people are moved by what he says, he won’t know it, at least not immediately. That’s the church’s policy going forward: no plans to resume live services. This is the new normal.  “It's very eerie,” he told me. “But I think we have a responsibility not only for the safety of our members, but for the citizens of Dallas to do our part in trying to keep our city safe.” Jeffress grew up around First Baptist and he’s preached somewhere nearly every Sunday of the year for decades now. Usually, there are dozens of people roaming the halls and offices of the church. Between the family events, recruiting events, community Bible studies, there’s almost always something going on somewhere. But for now, the offices are nearly empty. As he talked about it, he sounded downright melancholy.  “It's sad to think about people not being able to come together,” he told me. “This is the time that we really need one another, and yet we have to follow common-sense guidelines because of our care for other people. But personally, it's very sad for me as a pastor, not to be able to be with his congregation.” I know he’s particularly savvy when it comes to publicity. I asked if there was any part of him that wanted to hold service despite the new guidelines, if only to force the government to shut it down. Imagine the optics! Jeffress laughed. “There was zero part of me that was tempted to do that,” he said. “People should not confuse faith with foolishness.” He reminded me that every morning when he gets on the highway, he prays for his safety, but he wears a seat belt, too. “God expects us to certainly exercise faith,” Jeffress told me. “But common sense as well.”",One of Trump’s Evangelical Defenders Wrestles With Flattening the Curve,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/coronavirus-trump-robert-jeffress-evangelical-supporter-140355,politico
"In Finland, they’re drinking boxed wine and playing Korona, the board game. In Greece, they’re stockpiling feta. The French refuse to stop kissing. ISIS is telling its members to avoid traveling to Europe to conduct attacks. And, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, hand-washing stations are everywhere; they know the drill. As coronavirus continues its deadly spread, the whole world is preparing for the onslaught in similar ways—social distancing, working from home, panic buying at their local grocery stores. But people in different countries are also weathering this crisis in vastly different ways, finding, for example, different products to hoard, different ways to pass the time, different people to blame and even different things to worry about. Over the last week, I emailed, texted and posted a request on Facebook for friends around the world—including a network of acquaintances and colleagues I’ve built over 20 years working in foreign policy, living in Europe and traveling widely—to tell me about their lives under coronavirus watch: items in scarce supply, coping mechanisms, jokes and the effect of culture and history on national responses. In total, I heard from more than 90 people in 68 countries, all of whom sent me anecdotes, press clips and Twitter videos providing a snapshot of life in mid-March under COVID-19. Here’s what I’ve learned so far. You probably think everybody’s buying toilet paper. And across the Western world, you’d be right. A dramatic supermarket fight over TP between two Australian women went viral. When the Dutch prime minister visited a grocery store, he reassured shoppers there was sufficient supply so “we can all poop for 10 years.” (Perhaps more worrisome, a 2015 survey found the Dutch were the least likely among Europeans to wash their hands after using the restroom; Bosnians and Turks fared much better.) A Lebanese friend cited a local saying that “we lived 20 years of civil war and never once were we out of toilet paper.” The great divide occurs around the use of bidets. As a Jordanian smugly told me, the TP hoarders are those who don’t use them. An Azerbaijani friend said his compatriots “tend to use water.” An amused Bosnian pointed out that toilet paper takes up storage space and people could simply shower. And an American posted on Facebook that her husband presciently requested a bidet last Christmas; sales have recently increased ten-fold. Across Africa, expats told me many people there cannot afford or culturally do not use toilet paper. As hand sanitizer and other cleaning products are in short supply everywhere, friends shared the desperate measures and creative thinking from their countries. In the UK, people have ripped hand sanitizers off the walls in doctors’ offices and stolen bottles from hospitals. In the Czech Republic, a friend saw a doctor on television dismiss concerns about a lack of disinfectant by citing the example of Moravia, where people make their own alcohol from apricots and plums. In Turkey, people are relying on a longtime tradition; Kolonya, a cologne whose alcohol to essential oils ratio can reach 80 percent, is found in nearly every Turkish household and ceremonially poured into the palm of visitors as a sanitizer. In Istanbul, one man offered it to riders on the subway. Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko joked that vodka is not only a good hand sanitizer, but its consumption could help kill the virus. The situation is better in South Korea, where press reports cite bottles of hand sanitizers in elevators and people dressed in costumes at subway entrances reminding the public to wash their hands.  While Westerners are being schooled in proper handwashing techniques, expat friends in African countries previously afflicted with Ebola said people there are already well-informed about proper sanitation measures. For example, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) there are handwashing stations (described as “little plastic tanks with chlorinated water and a faucet”) in every restaurant, store, business and airport. In Niger, the government has been continuing public safety campaigns and sending daily communications with doctors’ phone numbers if people suspect they are sick.  In the West, people are mostly avoiding masks, heeding doctors’ pleas to save them for health workers. But they are ubiquitous in Asia, though many already wore them to address air pollution. An Indian friend reported that a temple covered its idols with masks to protect them. In Lebanon, a friend said masks are serving a new purpose: Many women get botox in their lips every few months, but now some are wearing masks and postponing their fillers.  Germans, who have a word for everything, describe panic shopping as “Hamsterkauf”— mindless spending like a hamster storing food in its cheeks. Almost everyone across the Western world is stockpiling pasta. Spaniards are panic-buying toilet paper and jamón, with a meme showing someone slicing a loo roll as if it were meat. An expat in Kyrgyzstan heard radio commentators encouraging people to buy sugar and flour. Moldovans are purchasing garlic, with the cost recently tripling. Afghans are stockpiling rice, wheat and cooking oil, as prices skyrocket. Feta cheese sales are high in Greece. Serbs are buying rakija (a fruit brandy), while Finns are investing in multi-liter boxed wines. In the Netherlands, people panicked after the government announced plans to close “coffee shops” and formed long lines to stock up on weed.  Some shoppers are driven by memories of previous periods of deprivation. In Lithuania, a friend saw Soviet echoes in purchases of buckwheat and other grain for making porridges, pasta and potatoes. In Denmark, people are buying rye bread and yeast. (A Danish friend explained that a 1998 labor strike led to yeast hoarding when locals anticipated shops closing; although a shortage occurred then, producers anticipated the coming crisis and ensured sufficient capacity.) Several Bosnian expats, who survived a devastating war when the capital was under siege for 1,425 days, said the experience left a “huge imprint.” Their families in Sarajevo began storing food weeks ago, while others are planting more vegetables than usual. An Iraqi friend said decades of political instability and price uncertainty have long led people to store enough food in their houses to last at least a month. He recalled his father in the 1980s buying 50lb bags of rice and an entire sheep to keep in the freezer. Amid coronavirus, his mother is supplementing their existing stockpile with extra toothpaste and batteries for flashlights. A German friend with a Vietnamese wife said his in-laws call daily with advice about preparing for difficult situations and recommendations for natural treatments. Closer to home, a friend’s sister-in-law in Puerto Rico said “people have been buying supplies as if they are getting ready for a hurricane.” There is less concern elsewhere about food availability. Friends in stricken Italy and China reported a gradual reduction in panic buying as supply chains continue to function. Similarly, an Iranian friend said shoppers there were relatively relaxed, given memories of sufficient provisions during past wars. An expat in Vietnam reported that neighborhoods under quarantine near her get daily rations of rice, eggs, protein and cooking oil. In Africa, people have generally limited means to stockpile, which a Senegalese friend described as a “very Western concept.”  Others are more worried about their long-term economic survival. Ukraine and Georgia experienced extreme deprivation in the 1990s, which a local friend said created a survivor mentality; although people are not hoarding commodities, many are buying as much hard currency as possible. An Azerbaijani friend described calm at the stores but panic at the banks, as people want to buy dollars in anticipation of a currency devaluation amid declining oil prices.  People around the world are losing access to their traditional gathering places, which have closed as a health precaution: hookah bars in the Middle East, karaoke bars in Asia and banyas (public saunas) in Central Asia. In Greece, the government launched a communications campaign with the hashtag #menoume_spiti (stay at home). Spaniards have promoted their own self-quarantine, with hashtags saying #quedateencasa (stay at home) and #yomequedoencasa (I’m staying home). After seeing online images of Dubliners in packed bars last Saturday, the hashtag #closethepubs started trending in Ireland; the government ordered them to close the following day. Despite the “she’ll be right mate” attitude of Australians, a friend there said her sports-obsessed compatriots are stressed by the cancellation of participatory and televised events.  Several governments are taking extreme steps to enforce social distancing rules. In Italy, residents are only allowed to leave home for work, food, health or emergencies. They must carry an “auto-certification” form whenever they head outside, which can be downloaded from the Interior Ministry website, that describes their origin and destination. Failure to comply could result in jail time and a $230 fine. France is similarly requiring residents to carry documentation justifying “essential” reasons for being outside their homes, while the German state of Bavaria is imposing $27,000 fines if people violate new lockdown measures. In Serbia, the government deployed the army to its borders and the streets of its capital city to enforce the new state of emergency, including the requirement that those older than 70 remain home. In some countries, critics have accused governments of violating privacy rights. The Israeli government’s security agency is using cellphone data to track those under quarantine. The South Korean government is using technology to trace the movements of infected people before they were diagnosed, which it then publishes online so others can determine if their paths crossed.  Responses to these restrictions vary. Finns, who are renowned for their introversion, joke about having long wanted mandatory social distancing. As families prepare for a period of seclusion, a Finnish friend said people are purchasing a classic board game that coincidentally happens to be called Korona (the Finnish spelling of the virus). Likewise, an English friend joked that his country’s “main contribution to disease control is the social isolation we learn from childhood. It only breaks down in queues. It’s OK to talk in queues. But definitely not in lifts or on the tube. And certainly not over breakfast.” Others find it harder to adapt. The French are continuing their signature “la bise” greeting, with one survey reporting 66 percent of respondents greeted friends with cheek kisses in recent days. In Argentina, an expat reported that locals are struggling to stop sharing mate (the national tea drink). You’ve probably seen the beautiful scenes of quarantined Italians, singing together from their balconies. In Madrid, sequestered residents gathered on their terraces last Saturday evening to cheer their health workers. In Colombia, “ciclovía culture” (biking) remains strong. In Germany, the American dating show “Love is Blind” ranks third on Netflix and stores report shortages of barbells. Sadly, the Eurovision song contest has been cancelled. A new genre of reality show has emerged in China: livestreams of celebrities and regular people singing, cooking and exercising at home. Yet an expat in Kazakhstan predicted increasing frustration there, as the government has long throttled the internet, limiting access to YouTube, Twitter and WhatsApp, in the evenings when the president’s rival is online.  Mosques across the Middle East were closed, with worshipers urged to pray at home instead. Saudi Arabia temporarily banned Umrah pilgrimages, which can be undertaken by Muslims at any time of year, to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the government has not yet decided about the annual Hajj in July.  Churches have also been shuttered. Poland’s first coronavirus victim was the wife of a church steward who distributed communion during mass. A Polish friend said bishops revised their approach after that, explaining communion could be experienced spiritually instead of physically. Although the church initially increased the number of masses to comply with government restrictions on group gatherings, it has begun encouraging worshippers to watch broadcasts instead amid tightening limits. In some places, coronavirus has affected the relationship between church and state. Greece’s Orthodox Church caused controversy by stating that attendance at Eucharist and communion “cannot be a cause of disease transmission.” As doctors protested, the government intervened, with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis invoking his faith while advocating the need to follow scientific advice.  In addition, I learned about numerous kissing constraints. Orthodox worshippers in countries like Lithuania were told to stop kissing religious icons, while Spanish Catholics were advised against kissing statues. In Israel, the Chief Rabbi ruled that people should stop kissing the mezuzah when they enter or depart Jewish homes.  An expat in Moldova reported people drinking hot tea, which they believe will kill the virus. An Indian friend told me ayurvedic home remedies (such as turmeric and ginger) and cow urine are being recommended there as ways to get rid of the disease. In Lebanon, some Christian worshippers are delivering a mixture of holy water and soil from the grave of Saint Charbel Makhlouf, which is believed to have miraculous healing powers, to infected patients in Beirut hospitals. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has a nonchalant approach to the crisis, showed an audience the good luck charms—including an American two dollar bill and four leaf clover—that he carries in his wallet as “bodyguards.”  In Afghanistan, the Taliban tweeted assurances to international health organizations of their readiness to coordinate on coronavirus and urged special attention to the health of their prisoners in Afghan jails. In Libya, an expat’s friend said the existing closure of airports is largely positive as a containment measure, though people are worried that restrictions on borders and the entry of foreigners could affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The Syrian government has denied the existence of any coronavirus cases, but press reports cite concern among over-stretched hospitals and aid workers in refugee camps about their limited capacity to manage an outbreak. Even ISIS has issued health instructions, using Koranic verses, on washing hands, avoiding infected areas, and coughing or sneezing into hands or clothes. The group’s newsletter also advised its members against traveling to Europe for terror attacks given the pandemic there.  Racist attacks on Asian people in numerous countries have been well-documented. In China, an expat reports the opposite concern: a fear of foreigners. Although the virus is largely under control there, many fear a resurgence from overseas—even though new cases in the country are almost exclusively Chinese travelers who went abroad and returned home.  In Africa, the coronavirus is largely seen as a foreign intrusion, with early cases reported from European travelers or residents who recently visited Europe. For example, the Central Africa Republic just had its first case, from an Italian who had been in Milan. The first case in the DRC was a Congolese national who returned to Kinshasa from his home in France. Anti-foreigner sentiment is rising in Ethiopia, where typical derogatory comments targeting “ferengi” (foreigner) are now being combined with “corona.” Reports of foreigners being harassed and assaulted in coronavirus-related incidents—including being hit with stones, spat on, chased and denied transportation services—led the U.S. Embassy there to issue a travel advisory this week.  An Afghan friend said some of his compatriots believe coronavirus is a conspiracy from infidel countries to prevent Muslims from practicing their religious rights, while others view it as a new economic warfare tool between the U.S. and China that doesn’t affect them. The Taliban suggested coronavirus is a God-sent scourge in response to “disobedience” and “sins of mankind.” In Egypt, the minister of religious affairs accused the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to spread the coronavirus among the military, police, judiciary and media. The Iranian regime has blamed the U.S. and Israel, while Chinese officials have suggested the disease was brought to their country by the American army. The United States is not immune to the conspiracy theory trend; for example, former congressman Ron Paul called it a “big hoax” and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell blamed the North Koreans. When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa instructed his citizens on the healthy elbow bump, it quickly became a local dance move. Even in Syria, there are music videos; this one lambasts President Bashar al-Assad as the “real corona.” A viral clip from Britain’s classic tv show “Yes, Minister” about hapless government officials reflects how many feel about London’s sluggish response. A Serbian friend shared a circulating video that shows a pig being roasted the traditional way on a spit; the swine is wearing a face mask, as an off-camera voice cites the importance of prevention. There is widespread chuckling about the number of divorces and births that coronavirus may cause. A popular Twitter meme says: “Your grandparents were called to war. You are being called to sit on a couch. You can do this!” A common European joke says it is the first time in history that the original is from China and the copy is from Milan. Azerbaijanis love garlic and onion, so they suggest that their eating habits will induce social distancing and destroy the virus. Self-deprecating Kosovars jest that “even the virus doesn’t want to visit Kosovo.” Inspired by the crowded supermarkets in Bulgaria, someone there wrote a parody of a classic poem about the historic battle at Shipka Pass in 1877 during the Russo-Turkish war. The new version describes a bloody grocery store battle, which rages until Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Donald Trump arrive to impose order.","Cologne Sanitizer, Boxed Wine and Bidets: How People in 68 Countries Are Coping With Coronavirus",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/cologne-sanitizer-boxed-wine-and-bidets-how-people-in-68-countries-are-coping-with-coronavirus-140648,politico
"Donald Trump’s MAGA followers finally agree: the coronavirus threat is real. But there’s now a growing chorus worried the president might overdo the response.  The fear is that the media and mass hysteria has cowed Trump into fully tanking the economy in response to what they believe is a dangerous, but not apocalyptic, disease. Despite warnings from Trump’s own health officials that millions could die unless drastic action is taken, some of the president’s supporters worry that the dangers of overreacting could also be severe.  “More than a month of people actually quarantined will break down civil society. Nobody is used to this, and when the money runs out for people they will get desperate — and there’s not enough money the government can dole out that’ll be enough,” said David Reaboi, the former vice president for strategic communications at the far-right Center for Security Policy think tank and a political commentator. “People will start to panic, then [begin] killing and looting. And we’ll face a society-wide crisis that’s more than simply economic. Absorbing the death of a certain number of people is preferable to that, if those are the options. Amazing and horrible to even think like that, but here we are.” A variation of the debate has also started to infiltrate more mainstream circles, with a much-read Wall Street Journal editorial recently weighing how much financial devastation is worth the health benefits a prolonged economic stoppage will bring. Public health officials insist such measures are necessary for now, noting the coronavirus is far worse than the flu — it is at least 10 times as lethal and about three times as contagious, according to officials. And recent data has also shown that the disease may pose greater risks to younger generations than previously thought — nearly 40 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations were people aged 20 to 54, according to a government report. The fall-out has ramifications for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, robbing the president of his most-common talking point — that he has overseen a growing economy. Instead Trump is facing criticism that problems with coronavirus testing and his own misleading rhetoric harmed efforts to quash the disease’s spread. And with large gatherings barred for the foreseeable future, Trump’s energetic rallies are off for now. After initially downplaying the coronavirus threat, Trump has gotten behind severe measures to slow the disease’s spread. He supported governors as they ordered the closure of all restaurants and bars and applauded shelter-at-home orders, even as it caused the stock market to tank and sent businesses sliding toward bankruptcy. Trump himself has directed Americans to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people. The reaction among Trump’s supporters is evolving, as well. A week after Trump’s base seemed to be splitting over the seriousness of the coronavirus, the quarrel is now over how much the government should damage the economy in response to the present threat. “For generation X and younger MAGA influencers, we’re pretty much all uniformly on board with social distancing [and] flattening the curve policies. [The] only discussion is about severity,” said Jack Posobiec, a correspondent with the Trump-friendly One America News Network.  Posobiec advocates a “kill this thing, whatever it takes” approach, but acknowledged that “the draconian nature of government edicts is definitely something that causes old school conservatives to viscerally recoil — especially as pertains to business.” It will inevitably be difficult for Trump to please his entire base, though. Some think Trump should deploy any emergency power that would help contain the virus. Others believe shutting down major sectors of the economy for weeks — dramatically limiting personal freedoms in the process — is misguided. Reaboi worried that the people able to drive the conversation about the shutdown--”information economy folks [who] are used to telecommuting and taking two weeks of vacation”--were disconnected from the very real struggles of people who need to physically be at their work.  “Those people are still the lifeblood of the economy, and even the telecommuters depend on them being at their jobs. There are millions of people like that who are uncertain about their futures now, and it’s not long until worry becomes panic, and panic becomes terror. What happens after that is a nightmare for everyone, even the tweeters most alarmed by the virus.” Fiscal conservative circles are starting to have their own discussion about how long the Trump administration should leave the economy fallow. The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Thursday called the extreme social-distancing policies “necessary,” but warned that they were not “sustainable.” “There is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks,” the piece said. “If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine.”  The Trump administration has stressed that two weeks of strict social distancing will help avoid an overwhelming crush of patients at hospitals that are already struggling with resource shortages. Trump’s advisers have said they will reassess those guidelines around the end of the month.  Yet in recent days, there have been signs that the situation is growing more dire in hard-hit areas, including California and New York. Both states have issued stay-at-home orders, and other states, such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Illinois, are following suit. Health care professionals are also scrounging for basic medical equipment, such as masks, to protect themselves — a shortage the Trump administration has vowed to address. More hardline Trump supporters claim the media and Democrats are still putting much of the pressure on Trump to fully stall the economy, even as other countries take similar steps and Republican governors implement economic restrictions almost identical to those of Democratic governors. Conservative commentator Candace Owens initially urged at-risk elderly people to quarantine themselves instead of shutting down bars and restaurants — an assertion health officials warn is dangerous because it ignores the fact that people of all ages are falling severely ill from this disease.  “Life does not mean ‘you get to live forever,’” Owens said during a March 16th Periscope stream, calling the “mass hysteria” surrounding coronavirus a media-driven “social experiment” that showed how much personal liberty people — particularly ostensible small-government conservatives — would shed during a crisis.  “The majority of Americans are not reacting in a way that you think that they should be acting because you’re fearful,” she said. “And if you believe in freedom, freedom doesn’t suddenly stop when you get scared.” A segment of American voters, particularly those who sided with Trump through the past three years of scandals, agree.  “We’re Americans, right? We don't live in a communist country, nor do we have to stay indoors,” said Katie Williams, a Las Vegas woman running for Carson County school board, citing Owens as an influence Williams blamed the media and liberals for pushing things this far.  “I mean, we are just one step away from communism at that point, you know?” she said. “With this media hype about the coronavirus, I think a lot of more democratic politicians, local politicians, are trying to push that agenda into more of a communist rule.” Williams' commentary went viral last week when she fired off a snarky tweet Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in defiance of the popular progressive’s plea for people to stop going to restaurants.  “I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I’m 30,” Williams tweeted. “It was delicious and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I’ll do what I want.” Williams does not believe her tweet was endangering public health.  “I don't have it. I haven't been exposed to anyone who has it,” she said to Politico. “I don't have any elderly people in my 10-foot radius of where I would go. And so when people were like, ‘You're irresponsible, you're out there spreading it,’ I'm like, ‘I can't spread it if I don't have it.’”  Health officials have pushed back against such logic, cautioning that younger people may not realize they’re infected and contagious. Still, Williams said that her tweet was simply meant to underline the hypocrisy of Ocasio-Cortez’s statement days earlier that “racism” was behind people avoiding Chinese restaurants after the disease originated in China. To this point, the Trump administration has taken several steps to keep Americans afloat during the crisis, delaying the tax filing deadline and suspending federal student loan payments for 60 days. The White House is also negotiating a massive stimulus package that could top $2 trillion and include loans to businesses and one-off payments to people.  In a comment to Politico, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign touted recent polling showing that the public largely approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “President Trump ignited the American economy once before. He is clearly the leader to restore our position once we are through this crisis. Joe Biden would undo all of the hard work that built the economy,” they said. For Trump voters, and the wider universe of people who generally support Trump, the tug-of-war between acting in the interest of public health and keeping Americans financially secure is only likely to grow stronger. “People diverge on severity of crisis versus economic cost,” Reaboi said. “It’s a real issue. Anyone who’s not taking that balance seriously is an idiot.”",A new MAGA movement debate: Is Trump overdoing it?,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/maga-movement-trump-coronavirus-140949,politico
"A U.S. House Democrat has been working to enlist the leader of a foreign government in a debate over a proposed copper mine in her state. The trick is that leader is Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum hopes that Trudeau will insert himself in the fray based on a 100-year-old treaty between Canada and the U.S. that governs the countries’ treatment of boundary waters. Opponents of the project near the Minnesota-Ontario border say it would threaten pristine waters and risk violating the binational treaty. The proposed mine would be located about five miles from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. ""From the air it looks like a green carpet, gouged southwest to northeast by glaciers,"" wrote a travel writer after time spent in the area. ""From the water it looks like another time — when nature was not a thing that grew at the edge of civilization."" What makes McCollum's pressure campaign to protect the area unusual is how publicly she has appealed to leaders outside the U.S. for intervention. The extent of the Canadian government’s willingness to engage is unclear. Communities and First Nations in Ontario upstream from the Twin Metals mine site question whether they’ll get to air their concerns about a massive resource development project that would be just miles away and subject to U.S. permitting rules. Any construction on the proposed copper mine, which environmentalists say poses the risk of leaching toxic slurry into the Boundary Waters, is likely years away. Proponents argue the mine would bring jobs to an economically distressed area of the state and would yield minerals integral to advanced technologies ranging from smartphones to wind turbines. The canoe wilderness is a federally protected area that doesn’t allow even motorized fishing boats and limits the number of canoe permits to keep the number of people there at any given time low. Trudeau has just come off a rocky few years with the president during which Canada grappled with the possibility that free trade with its biggest customer would evaporate. It's unclear he’d readily go to bat again over something like the mine, which is owned by a subsidiary of Chilean mining conglomerate Antofagasta. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said last month that the Liberal government is “very engaged” on the issue, though she offered no specifics. “It’s a proposal for a future project and it’s something that Canada definitely is involved in and will continue to work with our American partners on,” she said. The Canadian government has signaled its wariness. “Canada is concerned about the potential for increased mining activity within the basin which could contaminate boundary waters if not properly assessed and managed, putting Canadian water quality and ecosystems at risk,” Global Affairs Canada wrote in January 2019 to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management as part of the public comment process for the agency’s draft environmental assessment of renewing the mineral leases. The Canadian government asked BLM to clarify how federal and state governments will coordinate separate review processes to account for potential cross-border impacts, plus how BLM will interact with Canada “to better understand potential impacts to Canadian waters and ecosystems.” Becky Rom, national chairwoman of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters, said she checks regularly with Canadian officials and believes they've yet to receive a response from BLM. Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokesperson for Freeland, did not comment on whether the government had received answers to its questions. BLM renewed Twin Metals Minnesota’s leases on May 15, and the company formally applied for federal and state permits in December. The Trump administration has moved to speed up environmental reviews and permitting processes for certain projects, but state regulators are conducting a separate review. The company says it expects those studies to take five to seven years. The International Joint Commission, a binational agency borne out of the 1909 treaty, is advising both governments on environmental issues tied to mining activity through the International Rainy-Lake of the Woods Watershed Board. ""Together, these represent the most appropriate forums to discuss the potential impacts and mitigation measures related to current mining activities and any new mining projects within the Rainy River Watershed,"" said Twin Metals spokesperson Kathy Graul. Still, some community leaders in Ontario are beginning to agitate for Canada to do more to notify communities near the watershed about the project and its potential impacts. Douglas Judson, a municipal Council member in Fort Frances, Ont., said his community — which borders Minnesota and is in the pathway of water flow from where the mine would be built — is still gathering information about the proposal. He said he suspects engagement has been limited in part because Global Affairs Canada is handling the issue due to its diplomatic implications. “I think that if the project were in Canada, there would be a very different discussion happening right now, and right now there’s no discussion happening,"" he told POLITICO. McCollum, whose district covers the city of St. Paul and is nearly 250 miles from the proposed mine site, is using her role as an appropriator to try to put the brakes on the project. She slipped language into the fiscal 2020 spending bill that required the State Department to report back to lawmakers on the effects of sulfide-ore copper mining in the area and U.S. plans to mitigate the risk of cross-border pollution. The department sent lawmakers an eight-paragraph response that McCollum called “embarrassingly inadequate.” She called on Ottawa to compel the Trump administration to release the “confidential” report in a scathing Feb. 20 statement. McCollum has said she plans to continue to press the issue during the fiscal 2021 appropriations process, specifically promoting “the need for a mining pollution early-warning system to protect our cross-boundary waters and prevent treaty violations.” She also has introduced a bill to effectively yank the leases from Twin Metals Minnesota by permanently withdrawing 234,328 acres of federal land in the Rainy River Watershed from most resource development. In 2016, the Obama administration proposed banning mining there for 20 years. The Trump administration canceled an environmental study of that proposal in 2018 and has refused to release any preliminary findings. McCollum attempted to revive the study in the fiscal 2020 spending measure for federal resource and environmental agencies, but the White House won out during eleventh-hour negotiations over the broad appropriations package. The project isn't without support in Congress. GOP Rep. Pete Stauber, who represents the district where the mine would be built, has blasted McCollum's attempts to get in the way. His Democratic predecessor, former Rep. Rick Nolan, also supported the mine. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith haven't opined one way or the other but have called on the administration to finish the environmental study. Even so, the project isn't without challenges in the U.S. legal system. A federal judge heard oral arguments in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's reinstatement of the leases in December. Judson said he's communicated with the office of rookie Liberal MP Marcus Powlowski, whose riding includes Fort Frances, to bring together bureaucrats from Global Affairs and Environment and Climate Change Canada to discuss the project's implications in his community, which includes a number of First Nations. “Canada is going through a moment right now on engagement and the role for Indigenous communities in environmental conservation and resource development,” Judson said. Diplomacy, he said, is “maybe sacrificing that community engagement right now, and that is a little bit troubling.”",House Democrat trying to enlist Trudeau in fight to save boundary waters ,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/justin-trudeau-minnesota-mine-betty-mccollum-139648,politico
"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s supreme leader refused U.S. assistance Sunday to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s comments come as Iran faces crushing U.S. sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets. But while Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticized those sanctions, 80-year-old Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials about the new virus to deflect blame for the pandemic. “I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?” Khamenei said. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” He also alleged without offering any evidence that the virus “is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means.” “You might send people as doctors and therapists, maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person,” he said. There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei’s comments. However, his comments come after Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted earlier this month that it “might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe(s) us an explanation!” Lijian likewise offered no evidence to support his claim, which saw the U.S. State Department summon China’s ambassador to complain. Wuhan is the Chinese city where the first cases of the disease were detected in December. In recent days, the Trump administration has increasingly referred to the virus as the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” virus, while the World Health Organization used the term COVID-19 to describe the illness the virus causes. Even a U.S. senator from Arkansas has trafficked in the unfounded conspiracy theory it was a man-made Chinese bioweapon. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people. Evidence suggests it originated in bats, which infected another animal that spread it to people at a market in Wuhan. The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed. An article published last week in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine similarly said it was “improbable” that the virus “emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.” Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak. His comments come as Iran has over 21,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,685 reported deaths, according to government figures released Sunday. Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries. Iranian officials have criticized U.S. offers of aid during the virus crisis as being disingenuous. They have accused the Trump administration of wanting to capitalize on its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since withdrawing from the nuclear deal in May 2018. However, the U.S. has directly offered the Islamic Republic aid in the past despite decades of enmity, like during the devastating Bam earthquake of 2003. Reassigning blame could be helpful to Iran’s government, which faced widespread public anger after denying for days it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing 176 people. Widespread economic problems as well has seen mass demonstrations in recent years that saw hundreds reportedly killed. Iranian hard-liners have supported conspiracy theories in the past when it suited their interests. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, some publicly doubted al-Qaida’s role and state TV promoting the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Americans blew up the building themselves. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad similarly raised doubt about the Sept. 11 attack, calling it a “big lie,” while also describing the Holocaust as a “myth.” Meanwhile on Sunday, Iran imposed a two-week closure on major shopping malls and centers across the country to prevent spreading the virus. Pharmacies, supermarkets, groceries and bakeries will remain open. In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom said its armed forces are now taking part in combating the virus, setting up mobile hospitals in various cities. And in Kuwait, authorities have instituted a nightly curfew from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m., warning violators face up to three years in prison and fines of $32,000 if arrested and convicted.","Iran leader refuses U.S. help, citing virus conspiracy theory",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/coronavirus-iran-conspiracy-theory-141188,politico
"Direct cash payments to American households will be a significant portion of the U.S. government’s response to the coronavirus crisis. The logic is clear: When people can’t leave their homes and businesses shut down, workers lose their paychecks. Cash injections from the government – whether in the form of checks or unemployment insurance – help cushion that blow. But that is only part of the equation for American families trying to get through this challenging period. It’s not only about cash coming into households, but also the cash going out. At a moment when some struggling households need every dollar to cover basic necessities, it doesn’t make sense for cash infusions from the government to go right back out the door to make routine monthly debt payments. The present situation is anything but routine. For the most vulnerable, amounts falling due on debt should take a back seat to meeting essential needs in this time of crisis. This is not just a humanitarian imperative. It also reflects a sound and established principle in responding to debt problems, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern financial crises. When borrowers face a “liquidity shock” – a sudden and potentially transitory loss of ability to pay – the correct response is to give more time to repay. Pursuing repayment in such circumstances produces unnecessary, avoidable, and lasting harm. With time to get back on their feet, borrowers not only have a better chance at discharging their debts. They also can participate more fully and productively as consumers and workers than is possible with impaired credit or the threat of bankruptcy. With Americans poised to experience their most abrupt liquidity shock in U.S. history – due to job losses from the sudden lockdown on economic activity – now is the time to deploy the full range of tools for addressing it. That includes deferral of near-term debt payments for those who need it. Here are the categories of payments that should be available for deferral:  Tax payments, student loans and other obligations to the government. At the federal level, announcements have already been made regarding the delay of required tax payments, as well as interest on student debt. Principal repayments on student loans are now also eligible for deferral. Similar relief should be extended to obligations associated with other government programs, such as loans to small businesses and other credit lines. Mortgage payments. Lenders should establish expedited processes for facilitating forbearance on mortgage payments for stressed borrowers. The federal government has just directed lenders that work with mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offer affected homeowners payment flexibility for up to 12 months. Federal guarantees backstop any risk of credit losses on associated agency mortgage-backed securities. All mortgage servicers in the United States should use maximum possible latitude to facilitate deferred payments. Landlords receiving relief for mortgages on rental properties should pass through that benefit to their tenants by deferring rent payments. Auto loans, credit card payments and other debt. Financial institutions should work in an expedited fashion with vulnerable borrowers to implement interest-free deferrals of payments due on auto loans, credit cards, and other forms of consumer and business debt. These should be implemented with no penalties, fees, or negative reports to credit bureaus. Federal regulators have already encouraged financial institutions to work with customers who are having payment difficulties. Supervisory agencies should stress to these institutions that they will regard such actions favorably. Banks have indicated their willingness to implement forbearance programs, citing the model of natural disasters. But history has shown that actually achieving relief can be difficult and cumbersome for borrowers. A case in point is the mortgage modification programs following the housing collapse, which had disappointing utilization rates and consequently left many potential beneficiaries in financial distress. Many forbearance programs for natural disasters also have a poor track record.  Given the pervasive nature of this crisis and need to implement at scale, deferrals should utilize streamlined procedures that lower the barriers to accessing relief. Financial institutions already have extensive information about their customers. That can be the basis for proactive steps by banks to initiate forbearance. A web-based interface can take customer information, run it through preprogrammed algorithms, and speed up execution. In this crisis, eligibility criteria should be biased toward giving more access to relief, not less.  Thanks to the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 crisis, banks entered the COVID-19 episode with sizable liquidity and capital buffers. Aggressive Federal Reserve operations give banks access to functionally unlimited financing at almost zero cost. These backstops mean that U.S. banks are in a position to implement forbearance programs that cushion the economy and American households against the initial shock without compromising their own financial integrity. The implementation details of all the above programs are important and require elaboration. They should be carefully designed to forestall unintended consequences in capital markets, as well as for borrowers. In particular, we must prevent households from building up excessive debt during this period that hampers their post-crisis recovery. It is certainly possible that the impact of COVID-19 on the economy will be prolonged, not transient. In such a case, further and more aggressive steps will be needed. Such uncertainties should not prevent swift action on deferrals now. Epidemiological uncertainties do not prevent us from implementing steps gauged to manage prospective risks.  Both government and financial institutions must be held accountable for stepping up at this critical moment. Facilitating forbearance is a financial analogue to social distancing. It is not sufficient to solve all economic problems linked to the epidemic, but it is a necessary early element of a response that limits the damage. Banks were the cause of the last crisis. They can be part of the solution to this one.",Banks Should Defer Consumer Debt to Save the Economy,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/22/deferring-consumer-debt-could-save-the-economy-for-everyone-140763,politico
"Donald Trump’s MAGA followers finally agree: the coronavirus threat is real. But there’s now a growing chorus worried the president might overdo the response.  The fear is that the media and mass hysteria has cowed Trump into fully tanking the economy in response to what they believe is a dangerous, but not apocalyptic, disease. Despite warnings from Trump’s own health officials that millions could die unless drastic action is taken, some of the president’s supporters worry that the dangers of overreacting could also be severe.  “More than a month of people actually quarantined will break down civil society. Nobody is used to this, and when the money runs out for people they will get desperate — and there’s not enough money the government can dole out that’ll be enough,” said David Reaboi, the former vice president for strategic communications at the far-right Center for Security Policy think tank and a political commentator. “People will start to panic, then [begin] killing and looting. And we’ll face a society-wide crisis that’s more than simply economic. Absorbing the death of a certain number of people is preferable to that, if those are the options. Amazing and horrible to even think like that, but here we are.” A variation of the debate has also started to infiltrate more mainstream circles, with a much-read Wall Street Journal editorial recently weighing how much financial devastation is worth the health benefits a prolonged economic stoppage will bring. Public health officials insist such measures are necessary for now, noting the coronavirus is far worse than the flu — it is at least 10 times as lethal and about three times as contagious, according to officials. And recent data has also shown that the disease may pose greater risks to younger generations than previously thought — nearly 40 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations were people aged 20 to 54, according to a government report. The fall-out has ramifications for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, robbing the president of his most-common talking point — that he has overseen a growing economy. Instead Trump is facing criticism that problems with coronavirus testing and his own misleading rhetoric harmed efforts to quash the disease’s spread. And with large gatherings barred for the foreseeable future, Trump’s energetic rallies are off for now. After initially downplaying the coronavirus threat, Trump has gotten behind severe measures to slow the disease’s spread. He supported governors as they ordered the closure of all restaurants and bars and applauded shelter-at-home orders, even as it caused the stock market to tank and sent businesses sliding toward bankruptcy. Trump himself has directed Americans to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people. The reaction among Trump’s supporters is evolving, as well. A week after Trump’s base seemed to be splitting over the seriousness of the coronavirus, the quarrel is now over how much the government should damage the economy in response to the present threat. “For generation X and younger MAGA influencers, we’re pretty much all uniformly on board with social distancing [and] flattening the curve policies. [The] only discussion is about severity,” said Jack Posobiec, a correspondent with the Trump-friendly One America News Network.  Posobiec advocates a “kill this thing, whatever it takes” approach, but acknowledged that “the draconian nature of government edicts is definitely something that causes old school conservatives to viscerally recoil — especially as pertains to business.” It will inevitably be difficult for Trump to please his entire base, though. Some think Trump should deploy any emergency power that would help contain the virus. Others believe shutting down major sectors of the economy for weeks — dramatically limiting personal freedoms in the process — is misguided. Reaboi worried that the people able to drive the conversation about the shutdown--”information economy folks [who] are used to telecommuting and taking two weeks of vacation”--were disconnected from the very real struggles of people who need to physically be at their work.  “Those people are still the lifeblood of the economy, and even the telecommuters depend on them being at their jobs. There are millions of people like that who are uncertain about their futures now, and it’s not long until worry becomes panic, and panic becomes terror. What happens after that is a nightmare for everyone, even the tweeters most alarmed by the virus.” Fiscal conservative circles are starting to have their own discussion about how long the Trump administration should leave the economy fallow. The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Thursday called the extreme social-distancing policies “necessary,” but warned that they were not “sustainable.” “There is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks,” the piece said. “If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine.”  The Trump administration has stressed that two weeks of strict social distancing will help avoid an overwhelming crush of patients at hospitals that are already struggling with resource shortages. Trump’s advisers have said they will reassess those guidelines around the end of the month.  Yet in recent days, there have been signs that the situation is growing more dire in hard-hit areas, including California and New York. Both states have issued stay-at-home orders, and other states, such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Illinois, are following suit. Health care professionals are also scrounging for basic medical equipment, such as masks, to protect themselves — a shortage the Trump administration has vowed to address. More hardline Trump supporters claim the media and Democrats are still putting much of the pressure on Trump to fully stall the economy, even as other countries take similar steps and Republican governors implement economic restrictions almost identical to those of Democratic governors. Conservative commentator Candace Owens initially urged at-risk elderly people to quarantine themselves instead of shutting down bars and restaurants — an assertion health officials warn is dangerous because it ignores the fact that people of all ages are falling severely ill from this disease.  “Life does not mean ‘you get to live forever,’” Owens said during a March 16th Periscope stream, calling the “mass hysteria” surrounding coronavirus a media-driven “social experiment” that showed how much personal liberty people — particularly ostensible small-government conservatives — would shed during a crisis.  “The majority of Americans are not reacting in a way that you think that they should be acting because you’re fearful,” she said. “And if you believe in freedom, freedom doesn’t suddenly stop when you get scared.” A segment of American voters, particularly those who sided with Trump through the past three years of scandals, agree.  “We’re Americans, right? We don't live in a communist country, nor do we have to stay indoors,” said Katie Williams, a Las Vegas woman running for Carson County school board, citing Owens as an influence Williams blamed the media and liberals for pushing things this far.  “I mean, we are just one step away from communism at that point, you know?” she said. “With this media hype about the coronavirus, I think a lot of more democratic politicians, local politicians, are trying to push that agenda into more of a communist rule.” Williams' commentary went viral last week when she fired off a snarky tweet aimed at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in defiance of the popular progressive’s plea for people to stop going to restaurants.  “I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I’m 30,” Williams tweeted. “It was delicious and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I’ll do what I want.” Williams does not believe her tweet was endangering public health.  “I don't have it. I haven't been exposed to anyone who has it,” she said to POLITICO. “I don't have any elderly people in my 10-foot radius of where I would go. And so when people were like, ‘You're irresponsible, you're out there spreading it,’ I'm like, ‘I can't spread it if I don't have it.’”  Health officials have pushed back against such logic, cautioning that younger people may not realize they’re infected and contagious. Still, Williams said that her tweet was simply meant to underline the hypocrisy of Ocasio-Cortez’s statement days earlier that “racism” was behind people avoiding Chinese restaurants after the disease originated in China. To this point, the Trump administration has taken several steps to keep Americans afloat during the crisis, delaying the tax filing deadline and suspending federal student loan payments for 60 days. The White House is also negotiating a massive stimulus package that could top $2 trillion and include loans to businesses and one-off payments to people.  In a comment to Politico, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign touted recent polling showing that the public largely approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “President Trump ignited the American economy once before. He is clearly the leader to restore our position once we are through this crisis. Joe Biden would undo all of the hard work that built the economy,” they said. For Trump voters, and the wider universe of people who generally support Trump, the tug-of-war between acting in the interest of public health and keeping Americans financially secure is only likely to grow stronger. “People diverge on severity of crisis versus economic cost,” Reaboi said. “It’s a real issue. Anyone who’s not taking that balance seriously is an idiot.”",A new MAGA movement debate: Is Trump overdoing it?,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/maga-movement-trump-coronavirus-140949,politico
"American citizens in Peru who are trying to head home in response to the coronavirus outbreak are being held there by a Peruvian government that first wants assurances thousands of Peruvian citizens will be able to return from the U.S., according to two sources familiar with the situation. Peru is in the process of shutting down all international travel, but thousands of Americans are believed to remain in the country. An U.S. official familiar with the situation said the Peruvian government is not allowing them to leave until the White House ensures thousands of Peruvians are given safe passage home. “The government of Peru is basically holding these Americans hostage,” the U.S. official said. “They want the U.S. to fill planes with Peruvians before they’ll let the planes land to pick up Americans. But they’re not ready or organized in the United States to gather their people up, and they don’t want to pay for the flight.“ One American stuck in the South American nation said he received similar information from the office of Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Feinstein’s office did not respond to a request for comment. “[The State Department’s] planned repatriation flights have not yet been approved by the Peruvian government,” read an email from Feinstein’s office to the stranded Americans. “They are requesting reciprocal support for their own citizens to leave the United States.” The State Department said it flew a group of Americans home on Saturday, including “medically vulnerable” citizens and some Peace Corps volunteers and embassy personnel. But a spokesperson did not comment on whether the Peruvian government is preventing the rest from leaving. U.S. diplomats estimate a few thousand Americans remain in Peru, a spokesperson did not respond to a question about the number. Peruvian officials, meanwhile, say they are merely trying to figure out how best to get each nation’s residents home. ""We are actively engaging State Department officials to coordinate in a harmonic way the best way to carry out bringing Americans from Peru back to the U.S. and Peruvians in the U.S. back to Peru,"" said Rodolfo Pereira, press counselor for the Peruvian Embassy in Washington. ""What we are trying to set up is the best system to conduct that operation."" Pereira dismissed questions about tensions between the two sides, saying there are constant communications, including at high levels, and that much of what is being discussed is logistics. In a phone interview, he said he didn't know exactly how many Peruvians in the United States were trying to get back home, but estimated that it was about 6,000. He described them as a mix of students, vacationers and temporary workers. He noted that Peru's government was trying to help its citizens stranded in other countries return as well while Peru imposes a full shutdown of its borders and airports. Asked about criticism that Peru was essentially taking Americans hostage until its citizens were brought back, Pereira said, ""No, that's not the case."" He said it was simply a matter of reciprocity. ""It's a two-way conversation,"" he said. He did not immediately respond to a follow-up question about whether Peru will cover the cost of the flights. He also urged Americans stranded in Peru to visit websites his government has arranged if they need assistance. Americans also remain stuck abroad in other countries, including Guatemala, which closed its borders this past week. The U.S. citizens there, having received little help from the embassy and unable to book flights home, are crossing the border with Mexico in droves to get to airports where planes are still taking off back to the U.S., several people on the ground told POLITICO. The State Department on Friday began flying charter flights from Morocco, another hotspot for Americans stranded abroad, back to 10 different U.S. airports. The U.S. government has made ""individual efforts"" to bring home about 3,000 Americans since the outbreak began affecting flight service, Vice President Mike Pence said at a Saturday afternoon White House press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. ""I think there is an ongoing effort to address that with chartered commercial flights that the government is providing,"" Pence said. Military transport is also available, he said. ""We would just encourage any American that is looking on from overseas, contact the local U.S. Embassy,"" Pence said. ""Let them know about your circumstances. And know that we're going to work, continue to work very diligently to get our Americans home.""","Peru spars with U.S. over letting stranded Americans fly home during coronavirus outbreak

"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Sunday sought to downplay public disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a malaria drug could be used to treat coronavirus.  “There’s an issue here of where we’re coming from,” Fauci said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.  “The president, as heard, as we all have heard, what are what I call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work,” Fauci said. “So what he was trying to do and express was the hope that if they might work, let's try and push their usage. I, on the other side, have said I'm not disagreeing with the fact [that] anecdotally they might work, but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work.“ Fauci and Trump have publicly disagreed in recent days on whether the drug, hydroxychloroquine, could prevent Covid-19. Fauci said Friday that the drug had not been proved effective in clinical trials after Trump called attention to it in a press conference.  “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint, and the president was trying to bring hope to the people,” Fauci said. “I think there's this issue of trying to separate the two of us.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on President Donald Trump to send medically trained soldiers to his city to address escalating shortages amid the coronavirus outbreak. “All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,” de Blasio said Sunday on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “The military is the best logistical organization in the nation. If there are ventilators being produced anywhere in the country, we need to get them to New York. Not weeks from now or months from now, in the next 10 days.“  “Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve?“ de Blasio said. “I guarantee you they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order.“ More than 8,000 New Yorkers were confirmed sick as of Saturday, exacerbating fears that the city’s medical infrastructure will soon reach its breaking point. De Blasio has said the city could run out of medical supplies in as soon as two weeks. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday that the federal government would direct resources to Covid-19 hot spots, including New York.  “We were at the task force meeting yesterday, and it was very clear that the issue in New York was right on the front burner,” Fauci said on “Face the Nation“ on CBS. “The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most. And clearly that’s California, Washington state, and obviously New York is the most hard hit.“  De Blasio and other Democrats have called on Trump to compel businesses to manufacture more medical supplies through the Defense Production Act. “The American government is not at full bore right now,” the mayor said. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) urged President Donald Trump on Sunday to order the emergency production of medical supplies, saying his reluctance to do so would “cost lives” as the New York medical system becomes overwhelmed.  “The fact that the president has not really invoked the Defense Production Act for the purpose … of emergency manufactur[ing] is going to cost lives,” Ocasio-Cortez said on “State of the Union“ on CNN.  “We’re thankful to anyone who’s pitching in on this effort, but we are nowhere near the beds and the capacity that we need in this country,” Ocasio-Cortez added.  “We’re hearing it every step of the way from this administration. First we were hearing it was a hoax. Then we were hearing that everything was fine. Then we were hearing that the fundamentals of the economy was OK until the crash comes. And we cannot wait until people start really dying in large numbers to start production.“  She also urged the quick passage of an “emergency relief package” targeted at individuals rather than corporations. “When this package rolls out, there is no reason for corporate bailouts to be included in an emergency relief package,” she said. “We should be focusing: Is unemployment expanding?

"States are competing against one another for medical supplies and, in many cases, overpaying amid a federal shortage, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Sunday.  “We’re competing against each other, we’re competing against other countries,“ Pritzker said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “It‘s a wide, wild west … out there. And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.“ Pritzker said he’s gotten a fraction of the masks, gloves and gowns requested from the federal government. As a result, Pritzker said he’s deployed staff to purchase supplies on the open market internationally.  “I’ve got people on the phones, working the phones across the world, frankly, to get this stuff shipped to Illinois,” Pritzker said.  Pritzker also discussed his decision to move to a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents. “We have moved on now to a stay-at-home order,“ he said. “These should have been done nationally. They haven't been. But I have got to protect the 12.7 million people that live in my state. And I'm dedicated to that. It's their health and safety that matters most to me. It will work. It will work.“","It’s a ‘wild west’ for medical supplies in states, Pritzker says",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/wild-west-states-pritzker-says-141580,politico
"In early 2010, Dick Cheney assured conservatives that Barack Obama would be a one-term president, Sarah Palin teased a run for the presidency, and Donald Trump fired Rod Blagojevich from “Celebrity Apprentice.” Given how the world turns, it’s understandable why so many people were so wrong about the Affordable Care Act, signed into law 10 years ago Monday. Some treated the law like a panacea for the nation’s broken health care system, while others decried it as a certain step toward socialism. Some predicted it would end Obama’s political career and destroy the economy, while others said it would bring health care to every American — although the coronavirus pandemic has starkly shown the perils of being uninsured, or underinsured. We looked back at our favorite Obamacare predictions to see how they hold up in 2020. The results weren’t always pretty, but would you have ever guessed how important that one season of reality TV would be for Blagojevich? Not even close  The law’s insurance marketplaces never came close to hitting the projection from the nonpartisan number-crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office. Sign-ups have never topped 12.7 million, and enrollment has shrunken mildly since that peak in 2016, suggesting the marketplaces have, for now, hit a ceiling. The market never really expanded beyond those who received generous federal insurance subsidies. The CBO predicted that 4 million people would entirely pay their own way on the federal exchanges by 2016, but the actual number was closer to 1.3 million last year. “Arguably, Congress was overly stingy” said Sabrina Corlette, a researcher at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reform, arguing that the subsidies just didn’t reach enough people. Case in point: California saw new enrollment in its marketplace soar 41 percent this year after it began providing premium subsides to more middle-income people. At least two other important factors limited marketplace enrollment. The individual mandate penalty, before it was repealed, never pushed people to get covered as much as predicted. Also, employers were reluctant to dump workplace plans and send people onto the exchanges to buy their own coverage. Depends on who you ask Republicans warned the law’s mandates and new taxes would shrink the economy and kill jobs. Hardly. The private sector has grown every month since the law’s passage — at least until the virtual nationwide shutdown from coronavirus. Health care industry jobs fueled much of that growth in the past decade. In the law’s early years, Republican seized on a 2014 CBO projection that Obamacare would mean the equivalent 2.5 million fewer employers within a decade. Republicans for years claimed that was proof the law would kill jobs, but the CBO was accounting for people who would voluntarily stop working or log fewer hours because they would have a new affordable source for health insurance. In 2017, Stanford University economists found the law’s impact on jobs was close to nil. While some workers reduced their hours, a nearly equal number increased their hours to move off Medicaid and onto the exchanges, they said. Casey Mulligan, a conservative economist at the University of Chicago, argued the law’s employer mandate, requiring businesses of at least 50 full-time workers to provide coverage, kept a lot of small businesses from hiring more. And that the growth in health care jobs isn’t necessarily a good outcome, since that may have pulled money away from other sectors of the economy that might have benefited. Only if Congress kept the unpopular stuff During Obamacare’s drafting, central to Democrats’ argument for the law was the idea that it would actually be a budget saver, despite its hefty new spending on insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion. It doesn’t seem to have worked out that way, in large part because Congress has repealed or delayed many of the provisions that would have raised revenue. Roughly half of the projected CBO savings came from a long-term care insurance program that was quickly shelved when the Obama administration determined it was financially unworkable. Congress on a bipartisan basis had also delayed taxes on health insurers and medical devices in the past decade until killing them off for good last year, blowing an estimated $373 billion hole in the budget the next decade. All of this has made it impossible to discern the law’s effect on the federal deficit. The CBO has long since given up, telling Congress in 2016 that such estimates were becoming “more challenging and less meaningful.” Not so much Candidate Barack Obama in 2008 repeatedly claimed that his health care plan would save families up to $2,500 per year on their premiums. Obamacare critics have spent more than a decade pointing to rising premiums in workplace health plans — now over $20,000 for the average family — as proof Obama was wrong. Obama’s defenders say he didn’t mean people would see a $2,500 cut in their premiums — rather, the slower than expected growth in health costs would translate to savings. The math was always fuzzy, but opponents had an easy attack line.  Here’s one way to think about this: The average employer premiums increased 26 percent between 2009 and 2014, when the Obamacare exchanges opened, but grew at a slightly slower pace of 22 percent in the following five years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That slowdown in growth saved the average family about $1,000 per year. Not bad, but definitely not $2,500. Of course, it’s hard to say how much of those savings could be attributed to Obamacare measures promoting more efficient care. Economists have cited other factors, including hangover effects from the Great Recession and other changes in the industry, like the explosion of high-deductible plans requiring patients to pay more from their own pockets for care. Worst fears never materialized Some of the law’s critics predicted there just wouldn’t be enough doctors to care for all of the law’s new insured patients. Some Obamacare proponents argued the law’s plan to boost pay for primary care providers would alleviate the physician shortage. That didn’t quite work out. The nation is still facing a shortage of primary care physicians and wait times did increase. Two 2017 studies, from JAMA Internal Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Medicaid and privately insured patients experienced a slight increase in wait times since Obamacare’s coverage expansion took effect in 2014. But the NEJM study found more appointments were available to Medicaid patients and the rate stayed about the same for privately insured patients. The upshot: Obamacare certainly didn’t buckle the health system. While wait times in some areas may have increased, there has also been a boom in urgent care clinics to help meet demand. Stay tuned In a rare instance of a bipartisan agreement, top congressional leaders at the time said Obamacare laid the foundation for single-payer — albeit for different reasons. John Boehner said the ACA set up the infrastructure for the government “to eventually take control of all of our health care.” Harry Reid, a few years after the law’s passage, said it was a “step” toward nationalized health care. Many on the left, fed up with ever-climbing health care costs and that 30 million Americans remain uninsured, are embracing a Sen. Bernie Sanders-style “Medicare for All” plan that would provide generous government insurance to virtually everyone. But many Democrats still view the idea skeptically, wary of its price tag and taking away private insurance. Still, a government-run insurance alternative known as a public option, which a decade ago was considered too radical for Obamacare, now has broad support among moderates. And you’ll find many progressives who say a public option is the next logical step to single payer — that was essentially Sen. Elizabeth Warren's health care plan. So, put this prediction in the TBD column. The jury is still out There were many who thought the Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare in 2012, followed by Obama’s reelection that fall, would end existential threats to the law. The first indication that prediction wouldn’t pan out came two days after the 2012 election, when Boehner’s declaration that Obamacare was “the law of the land” sparked outrage on the right. Since then, Obamacare survived another major threat at the Supreme Court, when the justices in 2015 upheld the law’s insurance subsidy scheme, and a failed repeal effort during Trump’s first year in office. But it’s not out of the woods yet. Trump still muses that Republicans could repeal Obamacare if they retake full control of Washington. And there’s a more immediate threat to the law: The Supreme Court later this year is set to hear another case that could upend Obamacare. Ironically, the seeds of the latest challenge were sowed by Chief Justice John Robert’s 2012 decision upholding the individual mandate penalty as a tax. A group of red states, with the full support of the Trump administration, argue Congress’ decision to eliminate the penalty in its 2017 tax cut invalidated the individual mandate — and that the entire law must be struck. The lawsuit was once seen as a longshot, but it’s gained traction with Republican-appointed judges who have reviewed it. Roberts, just like in 2012, could hold the fate of the law in his hands. Not for some When the Supreme Court in the same 2012 case also ruled the federal government couldn’t force states to expand Medicaid, few Obamacare supporters predicted that even red states opposed to the law would refuse the program. After all, the federal government was paying at least 90 percent of the program’s costs — what state could pass that up? Some liberal pundits dismissed early refusals from Republican governors as brinksmanship, but the resistance has remained strong for a bloc of states. “I don’t think anybody anticipated the breadth and depth of political opposition that arose against this,” said Corlette, the Georgetown researcher. Fourteen states still have not expanded Medicaid, leaving about 4.5 million people without access to the program in those states. There are cracks in the resistance though. Since Trump’s election five states have expanded Medicaid, including four through ballot measures. Three more states — Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma — could join the program this year. Epically wrong  This is the most infamous prediction tied to the law. Obama’s assurances that people wouldn’t lose their doctor or insurer under the law were far too sweeping, and an estimated 4 million people received cancellation notices from health plans in 2013 as the law’s robust benefit requirements kicked in. PolitiFact labeled it “Lie of the Year,” and Obama apologized for the promise. The law did grandfather plans for people who purchased insurance before Obamacare was enacted, but the plans lost their protection if relatively minor changes were then made. To deal with the political uproar over plan cancellations, the Obama administration allowed an exception for these plans to continue — an allowance that exists today. Roughly 1.3 million people still have health plans that don’t conform to the law’s requirements. Insurance experts think that politically calculated decision to extend the old plans may have hurt Obamacare’s marketplaces in the early years. The older plans did not have to comply with many of the law’s requirements, such as protections for preexisting conditions, meaning the younger and healthier in those plans were likelier to keep the coverage while older and sicker customers gravitated toward robust Obamacare coverage. The law keeps going Republicans predicted the law would collapse under its own weight. Trump during his first year in office said the law was “imploding” before later declaring against all evidence that it’s “dead” and shouldn’t even be talked about anymore. Obamacare is still very much with us, and in many respects is stronger than it’s even been — unless the latest lawsuit kills it. Years of skyrocketing premiums have given way to modest declines in the past two years, and more insurers are signing up to sell coverage. HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who previously said Obamacare was “circling the drain,” boasts about how well the administration is running the law, even though insurance experts say the marketplaces have matured as they always expected. Despite turbulence around the law — the repeal efforts, the court challenges, the early HealthCare.gov struggles — the marketplaces seem to have stabilized. That’s largely thanks to its generous insurance subsidies, which have created a reliable base of customers shield from high premiums. Democrats not thrilled about Medicare for All have called for extending subsidies to more of the middle class. There’s little support for the idea among Republicans, who say Obamacare is too expensive and people need cheaper options. So, as Obamacare leaves its first decade, there’s one prediction we feel confident making about its second: You can keep your partisan fight over health care.",The Obamacare predictions that didn't quite pan out,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/the-obamacare-predictions-that-didnt-quite-pan-out-140547,politico
"Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor said Sunday that masks are currently being shipped to states, particularly hot spots like New York City and California — an announcement that comes as health care workers grow increasingly desperate for critical medical gear. However, Gaynor was unable to give more detail on when the masks would arrive or provide specific numbers. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”  ABC’s Martha Raddatz asked Gaynor if facilities would get them in time before the health system in critically affected states is overwhelmed. “Again, they're shipping today, they shipped yesterday and they're shipping tomorrow.” The White House coronavirus task force announced Saturday that 600 million N-95 masks were ordered to protect U.S. health care workers, but officials were unable to answer when they would be ready for use. At the briefing, Gaynor told reporters: “Every single governor across the country is looking for the exact same thing, so it’s a balance” and added that the masks “are out there now.” On Sunday, Raddatz pressed Gaynor: ""When you say 'they,' how many? Which masks? The new masks?"" ""I mean, it is hundreds of thousands of millions of things that we're shipping from the stockpile. I can't give you the details about what every single state of what every single city is doing,"" he responded. “But I'm telling you that we are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening. The demand is great."" Gaynor said the administration is prepared to “go to zero” in the national stockpile to meet medical demands.  He also reiterated that FEMA has been fulfilling its mandated mission in addressing the coronavirus, having let the Health and Human Services Department take the reins. “The public health medical mission, that authority lies with HHS“ Gaynor said. “My mission, FEMA, prior to this, natural disasters and those catastrophic events that happen. Now it's a different world.

"PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday that he would close the border if the U.K. did not take more restrictive measures to contain the coronavirus. “We had prepared the closure of our border and told Prime Minister Johnson we would implement it that day if there was no evolution [of British measures],” a senior French official familiar with the conversation told POLITICO. French paper Libération reported Saturday evening that Macron had “threatened” Johnson. The French official said that was “too strong a word” to describe the call. The U.K. on Friday ordered pubs and restaurants to shut, and asked people to stay indoors. Schools were also closed. However, Johnson’s office rejected any suggestion he had announced the stricter rules because of another country’s threats. “As the PM said on Friday these new measures were taken based on scientific advice and following the government’s action plan set out two weeks ago,” said a Downing Street official. Well before that call between Macron and Johnson, countries had started taking measures on their borders to contain the contagion, and to call for more homogenous measures across the EU. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on Monday for a temporary restriction on nonessential travel to the EU due to the coronavirus pandemic. (An exception would be made for the U.K. since it is still in a Brexit transition period.) The U.K. Foreign Office advised “against all non-essential international travel, initially for a period of 30 days,” effective Tuesday.

"Top congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet Sunday, as the Senate moves toward a key procedural vote on a massive $1.6 trillion-plus emergency economic package to deal with the coronavirus crisis.  And while Senate Republicans and Democrats say they are close to an agreement, they have yet to announce any deal.

According to a source familiar with the Republican text, there's still no language preventing layoffs for companies that accept federal aid. The source also said the tentative proposal gives too much discretion to the Treasury Department on who gets funds and does not include strong enough provisions to prevent stock buybacks. In addition, funding for the airline industry is a major sticking point.  Schumer and Pelosi have stayed in close touch with Mnuchin throughout the negotiations. Pelosi flew back to Washington on Saturday.  Late Saturday evening, McConnell instructed chairmen of key committees to draft language that senators could review before a floor vote Sunday that would advance the legislation, in an effort to meet a Monday deadline for passage. Democrats insist there’s no final deal.  While outstanding issues remain, Democrats are expected to see a win with $250 billion allocated to unemployment insurance — one of the major sticking points in the negotiations. In addition, billions are expected to go to hospitals to address the influx of patients due to the pandemic. Schumer has called for a “Marshall Plan” for hospitals. In addition, Sens.

Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), on the package’s small business provisions. The final deal on small businesses would amount to $350 billion, covering 58 million American workers and more than 30 million small businesses, Rubio tweeted Saturday. Meanwhile, hundreds of billions of dollars are expected to go to distressed industries, including airlines. Democrats insist the package include provisions to stop stock buybacks or increases in pay for top executives. Democrats have also pushed for expanded paid leave provisions.

"A federal judge in Los Angeles has rejected a plea from prominent convicted lawyer Michael Avenatti to be released from jail because of the risk he could contract the coronavirus. U.S. District Court Judge James Selna turned aside Avenatti’s claims that a bout he had with pneumonia last September puts him in grave danger if COVID-19 begins to rampage through federal prisons like the Manhattan detention center where he’s currently locked up. Avenatti, who was convicted by a New York federal court jury last month on charges of trying to extort shoemaking giant Nike and is facing other federal charges in Manhattan and Los Angeles, also contended that his cellmate was recently removed after exhibiting fever and a severe cough. But Selna, who revoked Avenatti’s bail in January based on evidence of extensive financial manipulation, said the health concerns were not adequate to justify his release. “The Court is mindful of the Covid 19 pandemic,” Selna wrote in a three-page order Saturday. “The Court accepts Avenatti’s showing that the had pneumonia about six months ago. ... However, there is no showing that his cellmate was infected by the virus, and there have been no reportedcases of Covid 19 at the New York MCC.” “There is no basis to release Avenatti on medical grounds,” added Selna, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “The Bureau of Prisons and MCC specifically have taken substantial steps to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. MCC has moved ‘at-risk’ prisoners, which presumably includes Avenatti, to a separate unit.” Avenatti rose to prominence in 2018 after filing a suit against President Donald Trump on behalf of adult film star Stormy Daniels, seeking to void a non-disclosure agreement the pair reached just prior to the 2016 election — a deal that appeared intended to hush up claims she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. Avenatti became a fixture on cable news shows and briefly mulled entering the 2020 Democratic presidential race. However, Avenatti and Daniels had an acrimonious relationship, with the porn star eventually switching to another lawyer last year. One of the three pending criminal cases against Avenatti involves charges he swindled Daniels out of nearly $300,000. Federal prosecutors opposed Avenatti’s recent request for release, arguing that his risk of infection is “minimal and entirely manageable.” “Defendant … has not cited any information or evidence demonstrating that defendant, who is an otherwise healthy 49-year man, is at greater risk from COVID-19 merely because he may have had pneumonia six months ago,” government lawyers wrote. “Thus, there is no reason to conclude that defendant’s personal circumstances are meaningfully distinguishable from the vast majority of individuals detained in BOP facilities or would justify the extraordinary relief he now seeks.” The prosecution also said Avenatti’s history indicated that the California resident was not only likely to defy court orders, but also the statewide lockdown ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom. “A person who ignores such admonitions and rules could increase infection rates, leading to severe illness and death. Defendant has shown an unwillingness or inability to follow rules, and a disregard for the welfare of others. Thus, defendant’s failure to follow rules poses particular dangers to the community,” prosecutors wrote. Documents submitted by the government said officials at the Manhattan detention center where Avenatti is located have taken numerous steps to limit the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak, including screening prisoners and staff for fevers, distributing more soap and segregating most prisoners over 55. However, H. Dean Steward, a lawyer for Avenatti, said the conditions at the lower-Manhattan jail known as the MCC are deplorable and are inviting a major COVID outbreak. ""Mr. Avenatti’ s cell contained three rats,"" Steward wrote. ""Inmates on one unit were forced to share one toilet among 26 people, and prevented from washing their clothing: prime conditions for the spread, rather than containment, of infectious disease."" The federal Bureau of Prisons reported its first confirmed case of novel coronavirus Saturday, involving an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Two staff members at BOP facilities in Kansas and Texas have also been stricken by the illness. Avenatti’s trial in the New York case involving stealing from Daniels is set to open April 21, but the judge handling that matter said last week it seemed “highly doubtful” it would go forward then due to virus-related suspensions of most proceedings in federal courts nationwide. Avenatti’s trial on fraud, perjury, tax dodging, and embezzlement charges in the Los Angeles case is scheduled for May 19, but Selna said that will likely be postponed as well.

"Donald Trump’s MAGA followers finally agree: the coronavirus threat is real. But there’s now a growing chorus worried the president might overdo the response.  The fear is that the media and mass hysteria has cowed Trump into fully tanking the economy in response to what they believe is a dangerous, but not apocalyptic, disease. Despite warnings from Trump’s own health officials that millions could die unless drastic action is taken, some of the president’s supporters worry that the dangers of overreacting could also be severe.  “More than a month of people actually quarantined will break down civil society. Nobody is used to this, and when the money runs out for people they will get desperate — and there’s not enough money the government can dole out that’ll be enough,” said David Reaboi, vice president for strategic operations at Security Studies Group who writes for The Federalist. “People will start to panic, then [begin] killing and looting. And we’ll face a society-wide crisis that’s more than simply economic. Absorbing the death of a certain number of people is preferable to that, if those are the options. Amazing and horrible to even think like that, but here we are.” A variation of the debate has also started to infiltrate more mainstream circles, with a much-read Wall Street Journal editorial recently weighing how much financial devastation is worth the health benefits a prolonged economic stoppage will bring. Public health officials insist such measures are necessary for now, noting the coronavirus is far worse than the flu — it is at least 10 times as lethal and about three times as contagious, according to officials. And recent data has also shown that the disease may pose greater risks to younger generations than previously thought — nearly 40 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations were people aged 20 to 54, according to a government report. The fall-out has ramifications for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, robbing the president of his most-common talking point — that he has overseen a growing economy. Instead Trump is facing criticism that problems with coronavirus testing and his own misleading rhetoric harmed efforts to quash the disease’s spread. And with large gatherings barred for the foreseeable future, Trump’s energetic rallies are off for now. After initially downplaying the coronavirus threat, Trump has gotten behind severe measures to slow the disease’s spread. He supported governors as they ordered the closure of all restaurants and bars and applauded shelter-at-home orders, even as it caused the stock market to tank and sent businesses sliding toward bankruptcy. Trump himself has directed Americans to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people. The reaction among Trump’s supporters is evolving, as well. A week after Trump’s base seemed to be splitting over the seriousness of the coronavirus, the quarrel is now over how much the government should damage the economy in response to the present threat. “For generation X and younger MAGA influencers, we’re pretty much all uniformly on board with social distancing [and] flattening the curve policies. [The] only discussion is about severity,” said Jack Posobiec, a correspondent with the Trump-friendly One America News Network.  Posobiec advocates a “kill this thing, whatever it takes” approach, but acknowledged that “the draconian nature of government edicts is definitely something that causes old school conservatives to viscerally recoil — especially as pertains to business.” It will inevitably be difficult for Trump to please his entire base, though. Some think Trump should deploy any emergency power that would help contain the virus. Others believe shutting down major sectors of the economy for weeks — dramatically limiting personal freedoms in the process — is misguided. Reaboi worried that the people able to drive the conversation about the shutdown--”information economy folks [who] are used to telecommuting and taking two weeks of vacation”--were disconnected from the very real struggles of people who need to physically be at their work.  “Those people are still the lifeblood of the economy, and even the telecommuters depend on them being at their jobs. There are millions of people like that who are uncertain about their futures now, and it’s not long until worry becomes panic, and panic becomes terror. What happens after that is a nightmare for everyone, even the tweeters most alarmed by the virus.” Fiscal conservative circles are starting to have their own discussion about how long the Trump administration should leave the economy fallow. The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Thursday called the extreme social-distancing policies “necessary,” but warned that they were not “sustainable.” “There is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks,” the piece said. “If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine.”  The Trump administration has stressed that two weeks of strict social distancing will help avoid an overwhelming crush of patients at hospitals that are already struggling with resource shortages. Trump’s advisers have said they will reassess those guidelines around the end of the month.  Yet in recent days, there have been signs that the situation is growing more dire in hard-hit areas, including California and New York. Both states have issued stay-at-home orders, and other states, such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Illinois, are following suit. Health care professionals are also scrounging for basic medical equipment, such as masks, to protect themselves — a shortage the Trump administration has vowed to address. More hardline Trump supporters claim the media and Democrats are still putting much of the pressure on Trump to fully stall the economy, even as other countries take similar steps and Republican governors implement economic restrictions almost identical to those of Democratic governors. Conservative commentator Candace Owens initially urged at-risk elderly people to quarantine themselves instead of shutting down bars and restaurants — an assertion health officials warn is dangerous because it ignores the fact that people of all ages are falling severely ill from this disease.  “Life does not mean ‘you get to live forever,’” Owens said during a March 16th Periscope stream, calling the “mass hysteria” surrounding coronavirus a media-driven “social experiment” that showed how much personal liberty people — particularly ostensible small-government conservatives — would shed during a crisis.  “The majority of Americans are not reacting in a way that you think that they should be acting because you’re fearful,” she said. “And if you believe in freedom, freedom doesn’t suddenly stop when you get scared.” A segment of American voters, particularly those who sided with Trump through the past three years of scandals, agree.  “We’re Americans, right? We don't live in a communist country, nor do we have to stay indoors,” said Katie Williams, a Las Vegas woman running for Clark County school board, citing Owens as an influence Williams blamed the media and liberals for pushing things this far.  “I mean, we are just one step away from communism at that point, you know?” she said. “With this media hype about the coronavirus, I think a lot of more democratic politicians, local politicians, are trying to push that agenda into more of a communist rule.” Williams' commentary went viral last week when she fired off a snarky tweet aimed at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in defiance of the popular progressive’s plea for people to stop going to restaurants.  “I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I’m 30,” Williams tweeted. “It was delicious and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I’ll do what I want.” Williams does not believe her tweet was endangering public health.  “I don't have it. I haven't been exposed to anyone who has it,” she said to POLITICO. “I don't have any elderly people in my 10-foot radius of where I would go. And so when people were like, ‘You're irresponsible, you're out there spreading it,’ I'm like, ‘I can't spread it if I don't have it.’”  Health officials have pushed back against such logic, cautioning that younger people may not realize they’re infected and contagious. Still, Williams said that her tweet was simply meant to underline the hypocrisy of Ocasio-Cortez’s statement days earlier that “racism” was behind people avoiding Chinese restaurants after the disease originated in China. To this point, the Trump administration has taken several steps to keep Americans afloat during the crisis, delaying the tax filing deadline and suspending federal student loan payments for 60 days. The White House is also negotiating a massive stimulus package that could top $2 trillion and include loans to businesses and one-off payments to people.  In a comment to POLITICO, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign touted recent polling showing that the public largely approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “President Trump ignited the American economy once before. He is clearly the leader to restore our position once we are through this crisis. Joe Biden would undo all of the hard work that built the economy,” they said. For Trump voters, and the wider universe of people who generally support Trump, the tug-of-war between acting in the interest of public health and keeping Americans financially secure is only likely to grow stronger. “People diverge on severity of crisis versus economic cost,” Reaboi said. “It’s a real issue. Anyone who’s not taking that balance seriously is an idiot.”",A new MAGA movement debate: Is Trump overdoing it?,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/maga-movement-trump-coronavirus-140949,politico
"The Justice Department has quietly asked Congress for the ability to ask chief judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies — part of a push for new powers that comes as the coronavirus spreads through the United States. Documents reviewed by POLITICO detail the department’s requests to lawmakers on a host of topics, including the statute of limitations, asylum and the way court hearings are conducted. POLITICO also reviewed and previously reported on documents seeking the authority to extend deadlines on merger reviews and prosecutions. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the documents. The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing that it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could legally deploy right now to try and slow the coronavirus outbreak. The DOJ requests — which are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House — span several stages of the legal process, from initial arrest to how cases are processed and investigated. In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.”  The proposal would also grant those top judges broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies. It would apply to “any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,” according to draft legislative language the department shared with Congress. In making the case for the change, the DOJ document wrote that individual judges can currently pause proceedings during emergencies, but that their proposal would make sure all judges in any particular district could handle emergencies “in a consistent manner.”  The request raised eyebrows because of its potential implications for habeas corpus –– the constitutional right to appear before a judge after arrest and seek release. “Not only would it be a violation of that, but it says ‘affecting pre-arrest,’” said Norman L. Reimer, the executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over. I find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.” Reimer said the possibility of chief judges suspending all court rules during an emergency without a clear end in sight was deeply disturbing. “That is something that should not happen in a democracy,” he said. The department also asked Congress to pause the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies, “and for one year following the end of the national emergency,” according to the draft legislative text. Trump recently declared the coronavirus crisis a national emergency.  Another controversial request: The department is looking to change the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in some cases to expand the use of videoconference hearings, and to let some of those hearings happen without defendants’ consent, according to the draft legislative text. “Video teleconferencing may be used to conduct an appearance under this rule,” read a draft of potential new language for Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f), crossing out the phrase “if the defendant consents.”  “Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant,” read draft text of rule 10(c), again striking out the phrase “if the defendant consents.” Reimer said forcing people to have hearings over video rather than in person would threaten civil liberties. “If it were with the consent of the accused person it would be fine,” he said. “But if it’s not with the consent of the accused person, it’s a terrible road to go down. We have a right to public trials. People have a right to be present in court.” The department also wants Congress to change the law to explicitly say that people with Covid-19 –– the illness caused by the novel coronavirus –– are not included among those who may apply for asylum. And the department asked for the same change regarding people who are “subject to a presidential proclamation suspending and limiting the entry of aliens into the United States,” according to the draft legislative language. Layli Miller-Muro, the CEO of the Tahirih Justice Center, which advocates for women and girls fleeing violence, said the language would block anyone on a presidential travel ban list from seeking asylum in the U.S. “I think it’s a humanitarian tragedy that fails to recognize that vulnerable people from those countries are among the most persecuted and that protecting them is exactly what the refugee convention was designed to do,” she said. The asylum request comes as the Trump administration on Friday said that it would begin denying entry to all migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border, including those seeking asylum. “I hope we come out of this with a sense of oneness, interconnectedness,” Miller-Munro said of the coronavirus pandemic. “Borders can’t protect us. Viruses do not care.”",DOJ seeks new emergency powers amid coronavirus pandemic,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023,politico
"President Donald Trump’s former economic chief said Sunday that Congress should require businesses to pay independent contractors out of work during the coronavirus crisis.  “Think of people that work at stadiums and arenas. Think of people that work in catering businesses. Think of Uber drivers and Lyft drivers. They need to get compensated as well,” Gary Cohn, Trump’s former chief economic adviser, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.  Democrats are expected to secure $250 billion allocated to unemployment insurance in a deal with the Trump administration. But that would not help workers classified as independent contractors, who are ineligible for unemployment benefits.  Cohn said that the legislation should require businesses that hired contractors and part-time workers to “go back and look at what you were paying them for the last month, or the last two weeks, and you go back and pay them that exact amount of money.“","Congress should bail out gig workers, Cohn says",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/congress-gig-economy-workers-cohn-141886,politico
"Governors, mayors and front-line health care workers confronting rising numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients said Sunday they have not received meaningful amounts of federal aid, including the shipments of desperately needed masks and other emergency equipment that administration officials say they have already dispatched. As the crisis spreads, Congress was planning a rare Sunday procedural vote as it moved toward a deal on a third coronavirus aid package. Containing both broad economic stimulus measures and direct help for American families, it could pass the Senate as early as Monday. The pressure on hospitals in hard-hit areas was mounting, and several Democratic governors demanded a more coordinated national response to get supplies as fast as possible to where they are needed most critically. “We are desperate,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told ABC Sunday morning. “We've had a big ask into the strategic stockpile in the White House. They've given us a fraction of our ask.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer echoed that urgency, saying her state’s hospitals are dealing with about 800 confirmed cases of the virus — up from only one just 12 days ago — and are struggling with serious shortages of both test kits and protective equipment for medical workers. The shortages have forced hospitals to adopt risky practices like reusing masks and having staff wear bandanas when no mask is available. A lack of personal protective equipment puts medical personnel at greater risk of becoming infected or placed in quarantine, exacerbating hospitals' existing staff shortages. “We’ve got to have those masks,” Whitmer said. “Had the federal government really started focusing when it became clear that the whole world was going to be confronting this, we would be in a stronger position right now ... Lives will be lost because we weren’t prepared.” President Donald Trump tweeted that a ""very small group"" of governors ""shouldn't be blaming the Federal Goverment for their own shortcomings. "" He said the federal government is ""there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!"" The main hospital association said there are still crucial gaps in the supply line. ""There is a supply. Many people have them, but there's a gap and we're going to need more,"" Richard Pollack, the CEO of the American Hospital Association, told CBS. ""If we don't protect our health care workers, the system will completely collapse."" Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor, whose agency was not activated to run the pandemic response until Friday, painted a more optimistic picture in Sunday morning appearances on ABC and CNN. He said masks and other equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile are well on their way to states — particularly hard-hit areas like Washington, California and New York. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” Gaynor told ABC. “We are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening.” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, offered similar assurances on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most,"" he said. ""So not only is New York trying to get resources themselves, but we're going to be pouring it in from the federal government. So it would be a combination of local and federal. But it's very, very clear that they are a very high priority."" But Gaynor and other administration officials sidestepped repeated questions on exactly how many masks were being shipped and when they would be in the hands of doctors and nurses who need them. “I can't give you a rough number,” he said in another interview on CNN, adding that governors should not depend on federal disbursements and should try on their own to obtain masks and other equipment. “If you find it on the market, go ahead and buy it. FEMA will reimburse you for it,” he said. “This is a shared responsibility.” Several governors pushed back, warning that pitting states against one another, the federal government, and other countries in a bidding war on the private market is no way to respond to a pandemic that requires a coordinated national response to obtain and allocate emergency goods. “It’s a wide, Wild West…out there,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said of his attempts to obtain supplies. “And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.” ""We need the federal government to get us those test kits,” Whitmer agreed. “We need PPEs. And frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is — we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” Governors, congressional lawmakers and mayors continued to plead with the White House over the weekend to use the powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up manufacture of masks, ventilators and other scarce supplies as many hospitals say they’re set to run out within days. President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday morning that he has given a handful of car companies ""the go ahead"" to make ventilators and other unnamed ""metal products"" for hospitals, but gave no indication of a timeline or quantity. Converting factories from making cars to making medical equipment cannot happen immediately, and could take several months. In the meantime, hospitals need immediate help. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts. We've gotten no shipments,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on NBC. “I can’t be blunt enough: If the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.” De Blasio also called on the president to mobilize the military's health care workers to immediately deploy to coronavirus hot spots like his own city. ""All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,"" he said. ""Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve? I guarantee you they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order."" Though Trump signed the defense act last week, Gaynor confirmed that the administration has yet to use it to order any companies to manufacture more products. He suggested such a step wasn’t necessary as companies are already stepping up. “We haven't had to use it, because companies around the country, donations, they are saying, ‘What can we do to help you?’ And it's happening without using that — that lever,” he said. “If it comes to a point where we have to pull the level, we will.” Both in private calls with the White House and in public interviews, lawmakers are insisting that time is now. “We cannot wait until people start really dying in large numbers to start production, especially of more complicated equipment like ventilators and hospital beds,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told CNN. “We need to start this production right now to get ready for the surge that is coming in two to three weeks.”",Desperate and angry state leaders push back on Trump admin claims of mass mask shipments,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/state-leaders-trump-administration-mask-shipments-141884,politico
"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Sunday sought to downplay a public disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a malaria drug could be used to treat coronavirus.  “There’s an issue here of where we’re coming from,” Fauci said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.  “The president, as heard, as we all have heard, what are what I call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work,” Fauci said. “So what he was trying to do and express was the hope that if they might work, let's try and push their usage. I, on the other side, have said I'm not disagreeing with the fact [that] anecdotally they might work, but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work.“ Fauci and Trump have publicly disagreed in recent days on whether the drug, hydroxychloroquine, could prevent Covid-19. Fauci said Friday that the drug had not been proved effective in clinical trials after Trump called attention to it in a press conference.  “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint, and the president was trying to bring hope to the people,” Fauci said. “I think there's this issue of trying to separate the two of us.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on President Donald Trump to send medically trained soldiers to his city to address escalating shortages amid the coronavirus outbreak. “All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,” de Blasio said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.”  “The military is the best logistical organization in the nation. If there are ventilators being produced anywhere in the country, we need to get them to New York. Not weeks from now or months from now, in the next 10 days.“  “Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve?“ de Blasio said. “I guarantee you, they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order.“ More than 8,000 New Yorkers were confirmed to have the virus as of Saturday, exacerbating fears that the city’s medical infrastructure will soon reach its breaking point. De Blasio has said the city could run out of medical supplies in as soon as two weeks. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday the federal government would direct resources to COVID-19 hot spots, including New York.  “We were at the task force meeting yesterday, and it was very clear that the issue in New York was right on the front burner,” Fauci said on CBS' “Face the Nation.“ “The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most. And clearly that’s California, Washington state, and, obviously, New York is the most hard hit.“  De Blasio and other Democrats have called on Trump to compel businesses to manufacture more medical supplies through the Defense Production Act. “The American government is not at full bore right now,” the mayor said. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts.

"States are competing against one another for medical supplies and, in many cases, overpaying amid a federal shortage, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Sunday.  “We’re competing against each other, we’re competing against other countries,“ Pritzker said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “It‘s a wide, wild west … out there. And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.“ Pritzker said he’s gotten a fraction of the masks, gloves and gowns requested from the federal government. As a result, Pritzker said he’s deployed staff to purchase supplies on the open market internationally.  “I’ve got people on the phones, working the phones across the world, frankly, to get this stuff shipped to Illinois,” Pritzker said.  Pritzker also discussed his decision to move to a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents. “We have moved on now to a stay-at-home order,“ he said. “These should have been done nationally. They haven't been. But I have got to protect the 12.7 million people that live in my state. And I'm dedicated to that. It's their health and safety that matters most to me. It will work.

"Direct cash payments to American households will be a significant portion of the U.S. government’s response to the coronavirus crisis. The logic is clear: When people can’t leave their homes and businesses shut down, workers lose their paychecks. Cash injections from the government – whether in the form of checks or unemployment insurance – help cushion that blow. But that is only part of the equation for American families trying to get through this challenging period. It’s not only about cash coming into households, but also the cash going out. At a moment when some struggling households need every dollar to cover basic necessities, it doesn’t make sense for cash infusions from the government to go right back out the door to make routine monthly debt payments. The present situation is anything but routine. For the most vulnerable, amounts falling due on debt should take a back seat to meeting essential needs in this time of crisis. This is not just a humanitarian imperative. It also reflects a sound and established principle in responding to debt problems, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern financial crises. When borrowers face a “liquidity shock” – a sudden and potentially transitory loss of ability to pay – the correct response is to give more time to repay. Pursuing repayment in such circumstances produces unnecessary, avoidable, and lasting harm. With time to get back on their feet, borrowers not only have a better chance at discharging their debts. They also can participate more fully and productively as consumers and workers than is possible with impaired credit or the threat of bankruptcy. With Americans poised to experience their most abrupt liquidity shock in U.S. history – due to job losses from the sudden lockdown on economic activity – now is the time to deploy the full range of tools for addressing it. That includes deferral of near-term debt payments for those who need it. Here are the categories of payments that should be available for deferral:  Tax payments, student loans and other obligations to the government. At the federal level, announcements have already been made regarding the delay of required tax payments, as well as interest on student debt. Principal repayments on student loans are now also eligible for deferral. Similar relief should be extended to obligations associated with other government programs, such as loans to small businesses and other credit lines. Mortgage payments. Lenders should establish expedited processes for facilitating forbearance on mortgage payments for stressed borrowers. The federal government has just directed lenders that work with mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offer affected homeowners payment flexibility for up to 12 months. Federal guarantees backstop any risk of credit losses on associated agency mortgage-backed securities. All mortgage servicers in the United States should use maximum possible latitude to facilitate deferred payments. Landlords receiving relief for mortgages on rental properties should pass through that benefit to their tenants by deferring rent payments. Auto loans, credit card payments and other debt. Financial institutions should work in an expedited fashion with vulnerable borrowers to implement interest-free deferrals of payments due on auto loans, credit cards, and other forms of consumer and business debt. These should be implemented with no penalties, fees, or negative reports to credit bureaus. Federal regulators have already encouraged financial institutions to work with customers who are having payment difficulties. Supervisory agencies should stress to these institutions that they will regard such actions favorably. Banks have indicated their willingness to implement forbearance programs, citing the model of natural disasters. But history has shown that actually achieving relief can be difficult and cumbersome for borrowers. A case in point is the mortgage modification programs following the housing collapse, which had disappointing utilization rates and consequently left many potential beneficiaries in financial distress. Many forbearance programs for natural disasters also have a poor track record.  Given the pervasive nature of this crisis and need to implement at scale, deferrals should utilize streamlined procedures that lower the barriers to accessing relief. Financial institutions already have extensive information about their customers. That can be the basis for proactive steps by banks to initiate forbearance. A web-based interface can take customer information, run it through preprogrammed algorithms, and speed up execution. In this crisis, eligibility criteria should be biased toward giving more access to relief, not less.  Thanks to the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 crisis, banks entered the COVID-19 episode with sizable liquidity and capital buffers. Aggressive Federal Reserve operations give banks access to functionally unlimited financing at almost zero cost. These backstops mean that U.S. banks are in a position to implement forbearance programs that cushion the economy and American households against the initial shock without compromising their own financial integrity. The implementation details of all the above programs are important and require elaboration. They should be carefully designed to forestall unintended consequences in capital markets, as well as for borrowers. In particular, we must prevent households from building up excessive debt during this period that hampers their post-crisis recovery. It is certainly possible that the impact of COVID-19 on the economy will be prolonged, not transient. In such a case, further and more aggressive steps will be needed. Such uncertainties should not prevent swift action on deferrals now. Epidemiological uncertainties do not prevent us from implementing steps gauged to manage prospective risks.  Both government and financial institutions must be held accountable for stepping up at this critical moment. Facilitating forbearance is a financial analogue to social distancing. It is not sufficient to solve all economic problems linked to the epidemic, but it is a necessary early element of a response that limits the damage. Banks were the cause of the last crisis. They can be part of the solution to this one.",Banks Should Defer Household Debt to Protect the Economy,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/22/deferring-consumer-debt-could-save-the-economy-for-everyone-140763,politico
"In Finland, they’re drinking boxed wine and playing Korona, a board game. In Greece, they’re stockpiling feta. The French refuse to stop kissing. ISIS is telling its members to avoid traveling to Europe to conduct attacks. And, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, hand-washing stations are everywhere; they know the drill. As the novel coronavirus continues spreading, the whole world is preparing for the onslaught in similar ways—social distancing, working from home, panic buying at grocery stores. But people in different countries are also weathering this crisis in different ways, finding, for example, different products to hoard, different ways to pass the time, different people to blame and even different things to worry about. Over the past week, I emailed, texted and contacted via Facebook friends around the world—including a network of acquaintances and colleagues I’ve built over 20 years working in foreign policy, living in Europe and traveling widely—and asked them to tell me about their lives under coronavirus watch: items in scarce supply, coping mechanisms, jokes and the effect of culture and history on national responses. In total, I heard from more than 90 people in 68 countries, all of whom sent me anecdotes, press clips and Twitter videos providing a snapshot of life in mid-March under COVID-19. Here’s what I’ve learned so far. You probably think everybody’s buying toilet paper, and across the Western world, you’d be right. A dramatic supermarket fight over TP between two Australian women went viral. When the Dutch prime minister visited a grocery store, he reassured shoppers there was sufficient supply so “we can all poop for 10 years.” (Perhaps more worrisome, a 2015 survey found the Dutch were the least likely among Europeans to wash their hands after using the restroom; Bosnians and Turks fared much better.) A Lebanese friend cited a local saying: “We lived 20 years of civil war and never once were we out of toilet paper.” The great divide occurs around the use of bidets. As a Jordanian smugly told me, the TP hoarders are those who don’t use them. An Azerbaijani friend said his compatriots “tend to use water.” An amused Bosnian pointed out that toilet paper takes up storage space and people could simply shower. And an American posted on Facebook that her husband presciently requested a bidet for Christmas; sales have recently increased tenfold. Across Africa, expats told me many people there either cannot afford or culturally do not use toilet paper. As hand sanitizer and other cleaning products are in short supply everywhere, friends shared the desperate measures and creative thinking from their countries. In the UK, people have ripped hand sanitizer dispensers off the walls in doctors’ offices and have stolen bottles from hospitals. In the Czech Republic, a friend saw a doctor on television dismiss concerns about a lack of disinfectant by citing the example of Moravia, where people make their own alcohol from apricots and plums. In Turkey, people are relying on a longtime tradition: Kolonya, a cologne whose alcohol to essential oils ratio can reach 80-20, is found in nearly every Turkish household and ceremonially poured into the palm of visitors as a sanitizer. In Istanbul, one man offered it to riders on the subway. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko joked that vodka is not only a good hand sanitizer but it could also help kill the virus. The situation is better in South Korea, where news reports cite bottles of hand sanitizers in elevators and people dressed in costumes at subway entrances reminding the public to wash their hands.  While Westerners are being schooled in proper hand-washing techniques, expat friends in African countries previously afflicted with Ebola said people there are already well-informed about proper sanitation measures. For example, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo there are hand-washing stations (described as “little plastic tanks with chlorinated water and a faucet”) in every restaurant, store, business and airport. In Niger, the government has been continuing public safety campaigns and sending daily communications with doctors’ phone numbers for people if they suspect they are sick.  In the West, people are mostly avoiding masks, heeding doctors’ pleas to save them for health workers. But they are ubiquitous in Asia, though many already wore them to address air pollution. An Indian friend reported that a temple covered its idols with masks to protect them. In Lebanon, a friend said masks are serving a new purpose: Many women get botox in their lips every few months, and now some are wearing masks and postponing their fillers.  Germans, who have a word for everything, describe panic shopping as “Hamsterkauf”— mindless spending like a hamster storing food in its cheeks. Almost everyone across the Western world is stockpiling pasta. Spaniards are panic-buying toilet paper and jamón, with a meme showing someone slicing a loo roll as if it were meat. An expat in Kyrgyzstan heard radio commentators encouraging people to buy sugar and flour. Moldovans are purchasing garlic, with the cost recently tripling. Afghans are stockpiling rice, wheat and cooking oil, as prices skyrocket. Feta cheese sales are high in Greece. Serbs are buying rakija (a fruit brandy), while Finns are investing in multiliter boxed wines. In the Netherlands, people panicked after the government announced plans to close “coffee shops” and formed long lines to stock up on weed.  Some shoppers are driven by memories of previous periods of deprivation. In Lithuania, a friend saw Soviet echoes in purchases of buckwheat and other grain for making porridges, pasta and potatoes. In Denmark, people are buying rye bread and yeast. (A Danish friend explained that a 1998 labor strike led to yeast hoarding when locals anticipated shops closing; although a shortage occurred then, producers anticipated the coming crisis and ensured sufficient capacity.) Several Bosnian expats, who survived a devastating war when the capital was under siege for 1,425 days, said the experience left a “huge imprint.” Their families in Sarajevo began storing food weeks ago, while others are planting more vegetables than usual. An Iraqi friend said decades of political instability and price uncertainty have long led people to store enough food in their houses to last at least a month. He recalled his father in the 1980s buying 50lb bags of rice and an entire sheep to keep in the freezer. Amid coronavirus, his mother is supplementing their existing stockpile with extra toothpaste and batteries for flashlights. A German friend with a Vietnamese wife said his in-laws call daily with advice about preparing for difficult situations and with recommendations for natural treatments. Closer to home, a friend’s sister-in-law in Puerto Rico said, “People have been buying supplies as if they are getting ready for a hurricane.” There is less concern elsewhere about food availability. Friends in stricken Italy and China reported a gradual reduction in panic-buying as supply chains continue to function. Similarly, an Iranian friend said shoppers there were relatively relaxed, given memories of sufficient provisions during past wars. An expat in Vietnam reported that neighborhoods under quarantine near her get daily rations of rice, eggs, protein and cooking oil. In Africa, people have generally limited means to stockpile, which a Senegalese friend described as a “very Western concept.”  Others are more worried about their long-term economic survival. Ukraine and Georgia experienced extreme deprivation in the 1990s, which a local friend said created a survivor mentality; although people are not hoarding commodities, many are gathering as much hard currency as possible. An Azerbaijani friend described calm at the stores but panic at the banks, as people want to retrieve dollars in anticipation of a currency devaluation amid declining oil prices.  People around the world are losing access to their traditional gathering places, which have closed as a health precaution: hookah bars in the Middle East, karaoke bars in Asia and banyas (public saunas) in Central Asia. In Greece, the government launched a communications campaign with #menoume_spiti (stay at home). Spaniards have promoted their own self-quarantines, with #quedateencasa (stay at home) and #yomequedoencasa (I’m staying home). After seeing online images of Dubliners in packed bars last Saturday, #closethepubs started trending in Ireland; the government ordered them to close the following day. Despite the “she’ll be right mate” attitude of Australians, a friend there said her sports-obsessed compatriots are stressed by the cancellation of participatory and televised events.  Several governments are taking extreme steps to enforce social distancing rules. In Italy, residents are only allowed to leave home for work, food, health or emergencies. They must carry an “auto-certification” form whenever they head outside, which can be downloaded from the Interior Ministry website, that describes their origin and destination. Failure to comply could result in jail time and a $230 fine. France is similarly requiring residents to carry documentation justifying “essential” reasons for being outside their homes, while the German state of Bavaria is imposing $27,000 fines if people violate new lockdown measures. In Serbia, the government deployed the army to its borders and the streets of its capital to enforce the new state of emergency, including the requirement that those older than 70 remain home. In some countries, critics have accused governments of violating privacy rights. The Israeli government’s security agency is using cellphone data to track those under quarantine. The South Korean government is using technology to trace the movements of infected people before they were diagnosed, which it then publishes online so others can determine if their paths crossed.  Responses to these restrictions vary. Finns, who are renowned for their introversion, joke about having long wanted mandatory social distancing. As families prepare for a period of seclusion, a Finnish friend said people are purchasing a classic board game that coincidentally happens to be called Korona (the Finnish spelling of the virus). Likewise, an English friend joked that his country’s “main contribution to disease control is the social isolation we learn from childhood. It only breaks down in queues. It’s OK to talk in queues. But definitely not in lifts or on the tube. And certainly not over breakfast.” Others find it harder to adapt. The French are continuing their signature “la bise” greeting, with one survey reporting 66 percent of respondents greeted friends with cheek kisses in recent days. In Argentina, an expat reported that locals are struggling to stop sharing mate, the national tealike drink. You’ve probably seen the beautiful scenes of quarantined Italians, singing together from their balconies. In Madrid, sequestered residents gathered on their terraces Saturday evening to cheer their health workers. In Colombia, “ciclovía culture” (biking) remains strong. In Germany, the American dating show Love is Blind ranks third on Netflix and stores report shortages of barbells. Sadly, the Eurovision song contest has been canceled. A new genre of reality show has emerged in China: livestreams of celebrities and regular people singing, cooking and exercising at home. Yet an expat in Kazakhstan predicted increasing frustration there, as the government has long throttled the internet, limiting access to YouTube, Twitter and WhatsApp, in the evenings when the president’s rival is online.  Mosques across the Middle East were closed, with worshipers urged to pray at home instead. Saudi Arabia temporarily banned Umrah pilgrimages, which can be undertaken by Muslims at any time of year, to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the government has not yet decided about the annual Hajj in July.  Churches have also been shuttered. Poland’s first coronavirus victim was the wife of a church steward who distributed communion during mass. A Polish friend said bishops revised their approach after that, explaining communion could be experienced spiritually instead of physically. Although the church initially increased the number of masses to comply with government restrictions on group gatherings, it has begun encouraging worshippers to watch broadcasts instead amid tightening limits. In some places, coronavirus has affected the relationship between church and state. The Greek Orthodox Church caused controversy by stating that attendance at Eucharist and communion “cannot be a cause of disease transmission.” As doctors protested, the government intervened, with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis invoking his faith while advocating the need to follow scientific advice.  In addition, I learned about numerous kissing constraints. Orthodox worshippers in countries like Lithuania were told to stop kissing religious icons, while Spanish Catholics were advised against kissing statues. In Israel, the chief rabbi ruled people should stop kissing mezuzahs when they enter or depart Jewish homes.  An expat in Moldova reported people drinking hot tea, which they believe will kill the virus. An Indian friend told me ayurvedic home remedies—such as turmeric and ginger—and cow urine are being recommended there as ways to get rid of the disease. In Lebanon, some Christians are delivering a mixture of holy water and soil from the grave of Saint Charbel Makhlouf, which is believed to have miraculous healing powers, to infected patients in Beirut hospitals. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has a nonchalant approach to the crisis, showed an audience the good luck charms—including an American $2 bill and four-leaf clover—that he carries in his wallet as “bodyguards.”  In Afghanistan, the Taliban tweeted assurances to international health organizations of their readiness to coordinate on coronavirus responses and urged special attention to the health of their prisoners in Afghan jails. In Libya, an expat’s friend said the existing closure of airports is largely positive as a containment measure, though people are worried restrictions on borders and the entry of foreigners could affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The Syrian government has denied the existence of any coronavirus cases, but news reports cite concern among over-stretched hospitals and aid workers in refugee camps about their limited capacity to manage an outbreak. Even ISIS has issued health instructions, using Quranic verses, on washing hands, avoiding infected areas, and coughing or sneezing into hands or clothes. The group’s newsletter also advised its members against traveling to Europe for terror attacks given the pandemic.  Racist attacks on Asian people in numerous countries have been well-documented. In China, an expat reports the opposite concern: a fear of foreigners. Although the virus is largely under control there, many fear a resurgence from overseas—even though new cases in the country are almost exclusively Chinese travelers who went abroad and returned home.  In Africa, the coronavirus is largely seen as a foreign intrusion, with early cases reported from European travelers or residents who recently visited Europe. For example, the Central Africa Republic just had its first case, from an Italian who had been in Milan. The first case in the DRC was a Congolese national who returned to Kinshasa from his home in France. Anti-foreigner sentiment is rising in Ethiopia, where typical derogatory comments targeting “ferengi” (foreigner) are now being combined with “corona.” Reports of foreigners being harassed and assaulted—including being hit with stones, spat on, chased and denied transportation services—led the U.S. Embassy there to issue a travel advisory this week.  An Afghan friend said some of his compatriots believe coronavirus is a conspiracy from infidel countries to prevent Muslims from practicing their religious rights, while others view it as a new economic warfare tool between the U.S. and China that doesn’t affect them. The Taliban suggested coronavirus is a God-sent scourge in response to “disobedience” and “sins of mankind.” In Egypt, the minister of religious affairs accused the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to spread the coronavirus among the military, police, judiciary and media. The Iranian regime has blamed the U.S. and Israel, while Chinese officials have suggested the disease was brought to their country by the American Army. The United States is not immune to the conspiracy theory trend; for example, former U.S. Representative Ron Paul called it a “big hoax” and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. blamed the North Koreans. After South African President Cyril Ramaphosa instructed his citizens on the healthy elbow bump, it quickly became a local dance move. Even in Syria, there are music videos; this one lambasts President Bashar Assad as the “real corona.” A viral clip from Britain’s classic TV show Yes Minister about hapless government officials reflects how many feel about London’s sluggish response. A Serbian friend shared a circulating video that shows a pig being roasted on a spit; the swine is wearing a face mask, as an off-camera voice cites the importance of prevention. There is widespread chuckling about the number of divorces and births that coronavirus may cause. A popular Twitter meme says: “Your grandparents were called to war. You are being called to sit on a couch. You can do this!” A common European joke says it is the first time in history that the original is from China and the copy is from Milan. Azerbaijanis love garlic and onion, so they suggest their eating habits will induce social distancing and destroy the virus. Self-deprecating Kosovars jest that “even the virus doesn’t want to visit Kosovo.” Inspired by the crowded supermarkets in Bulgaria, someone there wrote a parody of a classic poem about the historic battle at Shipka Pass in 1877 during the Russo-Turkish War. The new version describes a bloody grocery store battle, which rages until Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Donald Trump arrive to impose order.","Cologne Sanitizer, Boxed Wine and Bidets: How People in 68 Countries Are Coping With Coronavirus",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/cologne-sanitizer-boxed-wine-and-bidets-how-people-in-68-countries-are-coping-with-coronavirus-140648,politico

"In the weeks since the coronavirus outbreak first reached the United States, @realDonaldTrump has launched a barrage of more than 50 tweets on the growing pandemic, initially offering a rosy assessment of the growing health crisis—assuring Americans that it will “all work out well,” that the outbreak was spreading “very slowly in the U.S.” and that it’s “very much under control”—even as the death toll rose and the number of cases ballooned. In recent days, Trump has taken a more serious tone about the crisis, advocating for policy responses and travel bans, but even the news conference announcing his national emergency declaration ended with a jaunty exclamation point. That’s Trump himself. But what about his Twitterverse? The president follows only 47 accounts on Twitter, a collection of family members, conservative pundits, administration officials and Trump-brand properties.  Even as health experts and mainstream reporters have grown increasingly anxious about the White House’s response to the coronavirus pandemic—and have taken to using their own Twitter accounts to share hand-washing videos and urgent warnings from doctors overseas—when Trump opens his own Twitter feed, he scrolls through something very different. The picture Trump sees, in a nutshell: That the coronavirus crisis is someone else’s fault (China, Joe Biden, etc.), that he’s doing a great job responding to it, and that a Trump-hating media is just fanning the flames.  “The American people have seen once again that President @realDonaldTrump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people,” tweeted Vice President Mike Pence. “Remember Democrats Pushed Impeachment While Coronavirus Spread,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday morning, with a link to a Breitbart column.  “@realDonaldTrump will use every tool available to protect the American worker as he safeguards the health of all,” tweeted Ivanka Trump on Tuesday.  As Trump faces the biggest public health crisis of his presidency, a reading of dozens of tweets from the president’s favorite Twitter users over the past week shows his allies shaping Trump’s feed into five main coronavirus narratives: While Trump has come under increased pressure to respond more forcefully to the outbreak, his allies have taken to Twitter to frame the coronavirus as a foreign threat that spiraled out of control because of a bungled international response.  “Remember, China initially REFUSED to allow the CDC into Wuhan,” conservative activist and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec said in a post retweeted into the president’s feed by his son Donald Jr.  “Inside China's high-stakes campaign to smear the United States over coronavirus,” read the headline of a Fox News article in the president’s feed.  “POTUS was right to restrict travel from China in January, and now there is more evidence that @realDonaldTrump made the right call restricting travel from Europe, too,” tweeted Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee.  “President Trump must take China on here—they created this health crisis, now they’re claiming America is to blame. Typical communist ploy. #Wuhancoronavirus,” tweeted Fox News personality Laura Ingraham.  The president’s allies were also quick to dogpile on 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who was vice president during the 2009 H1N1/swine flu pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic. Even so, former President Barack Obama has remained relatively unscathed by attacks in the Trump Twitterverse, which remains focused on Biden.  “When Biden was vice president, swine flu infected 61 million Americans and killed 12,000,” Ryan Saavedra, a reporter with the conservative online outlet the Daily Wire, wrote in a post retweeted into Trump’s feed. A few hours later, Trump himself took a swipe at Biden, blaming the former vice president for the deaths of thousands of people during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  “President @realDonaldTrump acted early and decisively... His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears,” tweeted Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, quoting the campaign's communications director.  “When @JoeBiden was faced with a public health crisis on H1N1, he pushed the panic button and the White House had to cover it,” read a message retweeted by Donald Jr.  Other tweets in the president’s news feed framed recent comments from Biden opposing xenophobia as opposition to Trump’s temporary ban on travel from China.  “If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would have contracted the virus faster,” a Trump campaign account tweeted. And in response to a Biden speech in which the former vice president criticized the president for labeling COVID-19 a “foreign virus,” Laura Ingraham tweeted: “Yeah, Joe! Let’s throw open our borders, our airports, our ports to anyone and everyone—that will really stem the infection rate!” Critique of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is largely absent from his Twitter feed. Instead, his allies have heaped praise on the administration’s response.  “Deeply impressive extraordinary partnership of America’s best and brightest business & government gathered at White House under leadership of @realDonaldTrump & @VP,” tweeted Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera after Friday’s national emergency declaration. “They and we are going to kick #Corona’s ass.” “This is a very good call,” conservative political commentator Eric Bolling tweeted on Friday in response to reports that Trump was planning to declare a national emergency.  “This is the leadership @realDonaldTrump was elected to provide,” tweeted Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, after the president’s Oval Office address on Wednesday night. “Acting early & decisively he put the U.S. on much better footing than other nations in handling the coronavirus.” “President Trump is exactly right: ‘smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,’” tweeted Congressman Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican close to the White House. “The President’s actions are proactive and decisive. This is exactly what we need to keep Americans safe and healthy.”  And a tweet from Eric Trump shared simply the headline of an adulatory New York Post column: “Trump passes coronavirus test with flying colors.”  The president’s eldest son, Donald Jr., has led the Trump Twitterverse’s charge against the mainstream press’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In his posts and retweets, he’s accused news outlets of stoking panic and helping China spread propaganda. “That the US media is trying to run with the Chinese propaganda that ‘China bought us time’ is a new low even for them,” Donald Jr. tweeted in response to a New York Times op-ed. “F-you!” “The media has thrown everything at [Trump] and none of it has stuck,” said YouTube personality Dave Rubin in a tweet shared by Donald Jr. “So now they have a vested interest in spreading panic, rejoicing over market drops and sewing general chaos.” “This Chinese propaganda about the origin of the coronavirus is being directly amplified and aided by the U.S. media, which is censoring anyone who notes the Wuhan origin of the coronavirus,” said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist and conspiracy theorist, in a post retweeted by Donald Jr.  “CNN is literally taking its talking points from the Chinese government,” read another Cernovich tweet shared by the president’s son. Other accounts followed by the president sounded a similar tone. “Erring on the side of maximum transparency is a good thing for the White House given the mass hysteria being stoked by the partisans in media and politics with [the] goal of affecting the election,” tweeted Laura Ingraham.  “I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using [coronavirus] as a tool to politicize things and to scare people,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet shared by McDaniel. “It's not responsible. This is not the time for this.” During a March 4 phone call with Sean Hannity, Trump falsely implied the coronavirus outbreak was not as bad as the seasonal flu—an idea he may have picked up from his Twitter followers, who have downplayed the virus’ threat. “They say the mortality rate for Coronavirus is higher than the flu,” tweeted Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. “Consider though that we have a flu vaccine and yet in 2019, 16,000 Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have that vaccine. The flu would be a pandemic.”  “The word ‘pandemic’ is scary, but as @drsanjaygupta points out, it doesn’t speak to mortality rates, only to global scope of infection,” Ingraham tweeted in late February. “As @CDCgov notes, actual mortality rates or coronavirus is very low.” On Friday morning, Ingraham tweeted a link to an article headlined: “Coronavirus: Facts vs. Panic,” which stated “most people who get coronavirus have mild or no symptoms” and “most around the world diagnosed from January-March 1 have already recovered.”  “Great time to fly if not in at-risk population!” Ingraham wrote Friday from the aisle seat of a Chicago-bound United flight.",What Trump’s Twitter Feed Tells Him About the Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-twitter-feed-covid-19-129170,politico
"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Trump’s monumental challenge: Rescuing industries in free fall,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show fealty to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says ‘well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made healthcare an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain, said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico

"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac, the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by the three largest credit reporting agencies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. Fair Isaac and VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico
"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development will leave the job at the end of this month, two people familiar with the move confirmed Friday, marking a high-level departure from one of the agencies tasked with responding to the global coronavirus outbreak.  Former GOP Rep. Mark Green is expected to submit his resignation to President Donald Trump early next week, according to a senior administration official, who said USAID Deputy Administrator Bonnie Glick, a Trump loyalist and former State Department foreign service officer, will take Green’s place as acting head.  Green already informed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, with whom he has worked closely on women’s global development programs, of his decision to step down.  “His plans have been in place for awhile, but he began telling folks last week,” said a person familiar with Green’s departure.  The outgoing USAID chief, who has been with the agency since Aug. 2017, is expected to be named president of the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Green previously served as president of the International Republican Institute, an organization once chaired by the late Arizona Sen. John McCain. The D.C.-based think tank lost its executive director Kurt Volker, who served as Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, amid the fallout from the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry last fall after he stepped down following his appearance as a witness in the probe.  “I believe the recent media focus on my work as U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute,” said Volker, who was involved in the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Ukraine. The McCain Institute could not be reached for comment.  Green’s exit from the agency, which has been at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to divert Middle East aid to religious minorities in the region, comes weeks after he announced a $37 million commitment to 25 countries that have been affected by COVID-19, which reached pandemic levels this week and has topped 1,000 confirmed cases inside the United States.  Earlier Friday, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up to $50 billion to fight the rapidly spreading virus by boosting containment efforts and the availability of test kits.

"Suspended schedules. Darkened stages. Empty arenas. As the worsening spread of the coronavirus has forced shot callers in sports, entertainment and politics to nix games, parades, conventions, campaign pit stops and gatherings of almost every sort and size, Donald Trump over these past few dizzying days essentially and begrudgingly has made the same decision—even if he hasn’t made an official announcement. After holding more than 300 rallies during the 2016 campaign and nearly 100 more since he was elected—after going last month to Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada and South Carolina to “troll” Democrats in the runups to the primaries—the president was not in Michigan, Missouri or Mississippi this past week, and he won’t be in Ohio or Illinois or Florida or Arizona ahead of Tuesday’s votes. He has canceled events in Las Vegas, Denver and Milwaukee. And for the first time in a long, long time, Trump has on his typically merry-go-round docket of rallies … nothing. All of a sudden, we live in a world without crowds. And for Trump, it’s an existential threat—as much a threat as a sinking economy or the virus itself. Because Trump doesn’t just love crowds. He needs them. He needs crowds because of their political utility. Needs them to mine “data gold.” Needs them to be rolling, roiling, visceral focus groups—listening to the ebbs and flows of their roars, serving them what they want, scrapping what they don’t, stoking support with a skilled evangelist’s call and response. He is, after all, at his best and most effective riffing to the rank and file as opposed to monotonously reciting from a teleprompter all alone in the solemnity of the Oval Office. And he needs crowds, too, and perhaps most importantly, on account of psychological necessity. “They are his lifeline,” Bandy Lee, a Yale University psychiatrist and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, told me this week. “He’s very good at this,” she said, referring to the catalog of his performances at his rallies, “because his life depends on it, not just the life of his presidency but the life of his psyche.” In the estimation of Lee and other experts of her ilk, as well as the many people who have known him and worked with him for years, the way Trump is ties back to the way he was raised. The “complete emptiness inside,” the “bottomless void” that “can never be filled,” the “psychological defects” and “pathologically narcissistic traits”—all of this, says Lee, is a result of the core particulars of Trump’s upbringing: his distant and demanding father, the disruptive near-death experience of his mother when he was just a toddler, his banishment to military school when he was barely a teenager. “The lack of love translates into desiring accolades,” Lee explained. “And the rallies are really the most critical crutches that he’s had. He needs his followers more than his followers need him.” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair calls “a live audience” his “oxygen machine.” “The crowds,” former Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell told me the other day, “get him through the night.” And it’s always been like this. Starting in the 1970s and ‘80s, the foundationally lonely Trump cultivated transactional relationships with reporters and gossip columnists, in the same manner as his mentor, Roy Cohn. At times, he used a fake name to do his own PR. He decorated the walls of his office with magazine covers bearing images of his own face. In Atlantic City, at his casinos, he jaunted across gaming floors, feasting on the clamor of the throngs. “They cheered him,” recalled Alan Marcus, a former Trump publicist. “In front of a big crowd, and a big crowd could’ve been 25 people or 25,000 people, he can shine. Because he’s got that Trump persona. The Trump persona takes over the room.” By the middle of the aughts, when the success of “The Apprentice” erased the stain of his personal failures and business busts of the ’90s, he obsessed about the reality show’s ratings. “Ratings,” said Marcus, “are crowds.” And Trump’s political ascent? Implausible to the point of impossible without crowds. In the couple years before 2015, on the precampaign campaign trail, at off-year cattle calls of would-be candidates, Trump tested out talking points. “He would put forth his position or his feelings, and he would judge the level of response,” the late political strategist Pat Caddell once told me. He monitored not internal polling but Twitter mentions and tallies of retweets. He gauged what sizzled on conservative talk radio so he could channel it back. At his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower, when he glided down the escalator to say that he was running, the crowd was so important he paid some people to be there. The next month, he drew approximately 4,000 people to a rally in Phoenix. A month after that, the crowd was roughly five times that size in Mobile, Alabama, where he had his plane circle the stadium to a standing ovation and the wild-eyed appeal of his candidacy became hard to ignore. “Trump’s campaign,” Roger Stone would write, “was centered around a ‘set piece rally.’” At one of them, in New Hampshire, he told the people he had lots of friends, and rich friends, but who no longer would be his friends if and when he got elected. “You know who my friends are?” he said. “You’re my friends.” The crowd. Their cheers. And ever since, all the way up to his last rally, in Charlotte, on the second night of this month, Trump has engaged in an almost hypnotic version of the same, over and over again, using every one of his signature events to draw red-capped crowds, and to talk about the size of the crowds—whether or not, of course, the specifics are true—seldom missing a chance to employ the crowds and their counts as an ongoing contrast to cudgel his Democratic opponents. “An integral, main part of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman has said. “The driving force,” according to the campaign’s COO. But as America shuts down, as Broadway goes dark and Disney World goes dormant and March Madness goes poof, Trump at the moment has been stripped of arguably his most potent political strength. Entering a new, utterly altered reality, mere weeks after he traveled to India to revel in the adoration of a crowd of 110,000, Trump sat in the White House at a desk called Resolute and appeared out of his element and underprepared—while Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in the general election, stood the next afternoon in front of a bank of American flags in a hotel in Delaware and spoke to mostly just clicking cameras and seemed not frail or poorly supported but serious and up to the task. Biden’s (small) crowds and Trump’s (large) crowds hardly matter because now there are no crowds at all. “Rallies are important to the Trump campaign, and I’d worry about losing them,” former Trump aide Michael Caputo said, “because it would tilt a bit to Biden’s advantage.” Another former Trump aide pushed back on the premise. “It’s very early in the presidential cycle,” Sam Nunberg told me. “He’s still going to be able to hold rallies eventually, calling the guy ‘Sleepy Joe’ and making fun of him … one way or the other.” Nunberg stressed that Trump still has television and Twitter, platforms on which he has an irrefutable record of mastery of a certain sort, and that his flush campaign is a Facebook juggernaut, too, and that he always has possessed a blithe capacity for surviving crises and skirting consequence. All valid points. He made a prediction. “Trump will end up doing rallies,” Nunberg said. “Pandemic or not, Trump will end up doing rallies.” “What are your plans, Mr. President,” a reporter asked him on Thursday, “about campaign rallies?” “I think the Democrats won’t be having rallies, but nobody shows up to their rallies, anyway,” Trump said. “So, what difference does it make?” “But what about you, sir?” “My rallies are very big,” he said. “On the rallies, we’ll make that decision,” he continued. “But at this moment, we don’t have …” He stopped himself—as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to say it out loud. “I was going to Las Vegas. … I was going to Colorado …” He fantasized about a rally in Tampa on March 25 that reportedly was being planned but had not been publicly announced. That didn’t prevent him from dropping highly dubious details. “All sold out,” Trump said. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do.” No more rallies. No more crowds. “It’s like, if Don Rickles performed to a room of three people, would he have been funny? You know, insult comics, they need the energy of the discomfort they create for the jokes to work, for the act to work,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me this week. “It’s very bad for Trump to not have crowds. And I think he knows it.”",What Is Trump Without His Crowds?,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-crowds-129048,politico
"OTTAWA — Over five extraordinary hours on Friday, Canada’s federal government suspended Parliament, delayed its federal budget, imposed new restrictions on international travel and promised a major fiscal stimulus package, while the Bank of Canada slashed interest rates as the country collectively braces for the impact of coronavirus. The announcements rolled out, one after another, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained in isolation at his home in Ottawa, dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic that has turned personal — his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday, though her symptoms are mild. Trudeau has no symptoms of the virus, which has so far infected 157 people in Canada and caused one death. Speaking from outside his home at Rideau Cottage, Trudeau assured Canadians the government will take any measures necessary to slow the spread of the disease and to cushion them against its economic impacts. “We do not want any Canadians to have to worry about whether or not they’re going to be able to pay their rent,” he said. “We need to make sure that Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best public health advice and keep themselves safe.” Friday’s announcements mark a dramatic escalation in the government’s response since the World Health Organization labeled the coronavirus a pandemic two days ago, and a stark change in tone — on Thursday evening, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was still saying the budget would be tabled on March 30, as planned. But on Friday morning at 10 a.m., all five of Canada’s major political parties agreed to a motion to adjourn the House of Commons until April 20, in response to the spread of Covid-19. The suspension could be extended if necessary. Parliament has also passed spending-related bills that will allow the government to keep cash flowing while the House of Commons and Senate aren’t sitting. “We will face this together, and we will get through this together,” Government House Leader Pablo Rodríguez told reporters. The parties have agreed to a process to allow Parliament to be recalled over the coming weeks, if needed, with a skeleton crew of members present — likely those who live within driving distance. Before Parliament shut down, MPs and senators rushed to pass the USMCA, which received royal assent on Friday afternoon, making Canada the last country to endorse the new North American free trade pact. A few procedural steps remain before Canada formally ratifies the deal, and it will be several more months before it goes into force. President Donald Trump said Friday that Trudeau told him during a phone call the day before that Canada was on the cusp of approving the trade deal. The all-party motion on Friday also delayed the federal budget, previously scheduled for March 30. Morneau did not say when the budget might now be introduced, or whether that could happen before April 20. The budget, however, has suddenly become an afterthought as Morneau turns his attention to the far more urgent task of keeping the economy afloat. In an exceptional act of coordination Friday, Morneau held a rare joint press conference with Stephen Poloz, governor of the politically independent Bank of Canada, to introduce emergency measures in an attempt to buttress the economy before it suffers significant damage. Poloz made the biggest splash by introducing an unscheduled interest rate cut of half a percentage point — his second 50-basis-point reduction in nine days — to cushion the economy from the effects of coronavirus and battered crude prices. The governor left the door open to do more, if necessary. Morneau also provided a boost of C$10 billion in available credit for businesses through two business development agencies. Jeremy Rudin, the superintendent of financial institutions, joined them to announce changes that will effectively add more than C$300 billion in lending capacity for major banks. Morneau promised that more help is on the way. Ottawa will unveil a ""significant"" fiscal stimulus package next week, he said, including direct support for individuals. The new measures will come on top of a C$1 billion support package the government unveiled on Wednesday, which included money for provincial health care systems. The finance minister said another volley of economic support could come out of a phone call scheduled for Monday between Trudeau and his fellow G-7 leaders. He added the G-7 is looking for a coordinated approach. Ottawa is also taking new steps to limit the spread of Covid-19 to Canada from beyond its borders. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said international flights arriving in Canada will be restricted to a smaller number of airports to allow for screening of all passengers. The list of airports has not yet been released. Garneau also said all cruise ships carrying more than 500 people, including crew, will not be allowed to dock in Canada before July 1. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Canadians should postpone or cancel international travel, and should practice social distancing, including by avoiding crowded places, waving or touching elbows instead of shaking hands and staying two meters away from other people. She warned that anyone who travels internationally will be subject to any new rules suddenly imposed in those countries. “Your one-week trip may become much longer,” she said. However, as of yet there seems to be little discussion of any possible closures along the Canada-U.S. border. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said conversations with U.S. counterparts on Thursday highlighted “how important that border is for both of our countries,” while Trump told reporters the border had not come up during his conversation with Trudeau. “I think what we have to remember is that viruses don't know borders,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu said. “A border is not going to contain the virus.” The new measures come less than 24 hours after Trudeau’s wife tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a trip to the U.K. and exhibiting mild, flu-like symptoms. Grégoire Trudeau is currently in quarantine, and the prime minister and their three children will remain in isolation for 14 days. Trudeau has no symptoms and therefore has not been tested for the virus. Other parliamentarians, including International Trade Minister Mary Ng and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, are also in self-isolation after experiencing symptoms, though they have not been diagnosed with the virus. Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan had also shown symptoms, but tested negative for coronavirus on Friday. The federal government’s new approach to the coronavirus comes in the wake of tighter restrictions imposed by a number of provinces during the past 48 hours. All four of Canada’s largest provinces have now recommended canceling events with more than 250 people or have banned them outright, and Quebec and Ontario have both closed schools for at least two weeks. Trudeau spoke with provincial and territorial premiers on Friday afternoon, but at least one premier has already made clear he believes Ottawa isn’t doing enough. In a news conference before the call, Quebec Premier François Legault called on Trudeau to ""rapidly limit the entry of visitors to Canada."" On Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the announcements came in a rush, landing in a city that has only seen a few cases of the virus so far, and where there’s a sense that the storm must be coming but somehow isn’t quite real. Just before noon, ministers and public health officials clustered together on a stage in the National Press Theatre, telling Canadians to stand two meters apart and not to gather in large groups. A large group of journalists faced them, sitting side-by-side, passing around a couple of microphones that got a quick wipe-down between each question. And then, a few hours later, everything was quiet on the Hill, except for the strange vestiges of business-as-usual that hadn’t yet ground to a halt. At 3 p.m., two small groups of tourists were being led through the galleries overlooking the empty House of Commons, one numbering just three people. They were among the last visitors to be allowed in, before the building closes to the public. Two floors below, the House of Commons cafeteria was shutting down for the day and staff were getting ready to leave. They didn’t know when they’d be back.

"President Donald Trump on Friday deflected blame for his administration’s lagging ability to test Americans for the coronavirus outbreak, insisting instead — without offering evidence — that fault lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama. “I don't take responsibility at all,” Trump said defiantly, pointing to an unspecified “set of circumstances” and “rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.”  The remarks from the president came in response to questions at a Friday press conference about the lack of widespread access to testing, an aspect of his administration's coronavirus response that has been the subject of widespread, steady criticism. Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea is testing each day.  And Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that “the system is not really geared to what we need right now” in and called the testing system “a failing.”  But Trump, who spent weeks downplaying coronavirus before declaring it a national emergency on Friday, argued that the health care system was not designed for an outbreak on the scale of coronavirus, “with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.”  The president kept his criticism lighter and more forward-looking at first, declaring that his administration is “leaving a very indelible print in the future in case something like this happens again.”  “That's not the fault of anybody — and frankly the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers but not for these kind of numbers,” he added. But then Fauci stepped up to the mic to clarify his position, arguing that the CDC’s testing system, “for what it was designed for, it worked very well,” and maintaining that an “embrace” of the private sector was necessary for testing at the kind of scale needed for the fast-spreading coronavirus.  Then, Trump began pointing fingers.  “If you go back — please, if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. they didn't do testing like this,” he interjected, referencing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that sickened more than 60 million people between April 2009 and 2010. Trump asserted that the Obama administration “didn’t do testing” and that when “they started thinking about testing,” it was “far too late.” He reiterated a claim made on Twitter earlier in the day, calling the Obama administration’s response to the swine flu outbreak “a very big failure,” though the H1N1's fatality rate of .02 percent is much lower than the lowest fatality estimates for the coronavirus thus far.  Trump later got testy with another reporter who pressed him on whether he bore any responsibility for the surge in cases, noting that he’d disbanded the White House’s pandemic office. Trump told the reporter, PBS NewsHour's Yamiche Alcindor — with whom he's butted heads with in the past — that her inquiry was a “nasty question.”  After noting that his administration had quickly acted to restrict travel from China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, the president said he personally was not responsible for dissolving the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which had been part of the National Security Council until his administration disbanded it and rolled its officials into another office. “And when you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people. I could ask — perhaps in my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.” Trump said. “You say we did that. I don't know anything about it.” He continued: “I don't know, CDC, perhaps they do that — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.” Trump then began to move on, before returning to defend his administration’s response.  “We are doing a great job,” he insisted, referencing the health officials and business executives gathered behind him. “Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great incredible doctors and business people — the best in the world — and I can say that whether it's retailers or labs or anything you want to say. These are the best in the world.”  He also pointed to the number of fatalities in the U.S. attributed to the virus, which has hit 40 in the several weeks since the first reported case in the U.S., and is significantly lower than other countries hit hardest by the disease.  “Compare that with other countries that are many, many times that amount,” Trump said. “One of the reasons we have 40 and others have and, again, that number is going up just so you understand.” Trump’s criticism of the Obama administration on Friday wasn’t limited to its response to its own pandemic. At another point in the press conference, Trump appeared to work in a shot at healthcare.gov, the website created by the Obama administration for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges that was infamously marred by connectivity issues almost instantly when it debuted. Announcing that Google had offered to assist the White House in the creation of a website to better help Americans determine whether they needed to be tested for coronavirus and where to get tested if so, Trump quipped that the tech “is helping to develop a website that will be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.”",'I don't take responsibility at all': Trump deflects blame for coronavirus testing fumble ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-coronavirus-testing-128971,politico

"President Donald Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus aims to jump-start a lagging federal response by expanding testing, giving hospitals more capacity to deal with a potential flood of new patients and expanding telehealth, so patients in hot spots can be treated virtually. It reflected a growing acknowledgment of the scope of the public health crisis, with Trump himself saying at a Rose Garden rollout of the plan that he will ""most likely"" get tested, without committing to share the results. At the same time, Trump rejected blame for any shortcomings in a testing system that critics say has contributed to community spread of the respiratory disease, saying “I don’t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” The various policy moves left many questions unanswered, among them whether a website Trump said Google is developing to screen and test patients could compromise their privacy. Here are some key features: The president said the administration is working with pharmacies and other retailers to make drive-thru testing available ""at critical locations."" And he announced a series of partnerships with private labs to boost testing capacity just one day after top federal infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told House lawmakers that the federal government’s current testing system had been a “failing.” The president said there would be another 1.4 million tests available by next week and 5 million within the months, adding, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.” Public health experts would disagree: Multiple tests are often used on one person, and while federal officials have been hesitant to project case numbers, Fauci himself warned lawmakers that a complacent mitigation response could boost case numbers to the “many, many millions.” Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that 11,000 Americans had been tested. The FDA approved the first high-volume coronavirus test today. The president also appeared to oversell an effort by an affiliate of Google to help develop a website that will aid the administration’s efforts to screen and test for people with the virus. Trump suggested a sweeping effort, saying Google had 1,700 engineers working on the project and had made ""tremendous progress"" — and that the site will be able ""to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. ... We have many, many locations.""  But Verily, the life-sciences arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, later said in a statement that the website is in ""the early stages of development"" and would be initially tested in the Bay Area, ""with the hope of expanding more broadly over time."" Vice President Mike Pence said the administration by Sunday evening will ""be able to give specific guidance"" on when the website will be available.  The announcement instantly raised red flags for patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Trump outlined emergency measures hospitals can take under the declaration, most of which would free up beds for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. “Critical access” hospitals that are limited to 25 beds and get higher Medicare rates can boost their capacity and extend patient stays now limited to 96 hours. The order lifts rules for where hospitals can treat patients within their facilities and lets them add doctors as needed. The hospital industry supports these steps and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to release more detailed guidance later Friday that could expand on Trump’s list. The declaration lets HHS Secretary Alex Azar waive certain laws to expand the use of telehealth, which public health experts say can help reduce risk of transmission. The new order appears to let Azar waive federal licensing requirements so out-of-state doctors can treat patients virtually in states with the greatest need. The $8.3 billion coronavirus emergency funding package Trump signed last week also allows Azar to waive restrictions on Medicare payment for telehealth, as Congress has typically done for past emergencies. Telehealth groups and lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the committee overseeing Medicare, have encouraged Azar to activate that authority. Trump in his Rose Garden remarks called telehealth a “fairly new and incredible thing,"" though health care providers have used the technology for over a decade.

"Even as he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, President Donald Trump couldn't help but shake hands. “I want to encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we have issued by CDC and these common sense measures,” Trump told reporters at a Rose Garden press conference with top health officials and healthcare, retail and pharmacy CEOs. “A lot of it is common sense.”  The CDC’s website says to “avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places — elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people.” But as Trump introduced CEOs and members of his coronavirus taskforce, he couldn’t resist extending his hand.  First, he grabbed the mic and adjusted it for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.  He later reached out to Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, who looked down at the president’s hand before grabbing it to shake.  Trump shook hands with three others before Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president of the LHC Group, put a stop to the hand shaking. Greenstein instead offered an elbow bump to the president.  “I like that,” Trump said, after elbow-bumping. “That’s good.”  Trump, who indicated Friday that he had not been tested but ""most likely"" would be, has been exposed to people with the illness. While Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has disputed a media report that he initially tested positive for the virus less than a week after meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his press secretary, who took photos with Trump, tested positive for coronavirus this week.  Aside from his meeting with Bolsonaro in Florida, Trump has also been exposed to multiple Republican lawmakers who have self-quarantined after their own exposure to someone who tested positive for coronavirus at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump said he had not experienced any symptoms of the disease, but was consulting with his doctors on whether, and when, to get tested.  ""I think I will do it anyway,"" the president said, though he did not commit to sharing the results of a possible test. ""We are working out a schedule.""",Trump can't resist handshakes as he declares a coronavirus national emergency,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-cant-resist-handshakes-as-he-declares-a-coronavirus-national-emergency-128950,politico
"The full bench of the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to weigh in on two legal fights critical to President Donald Trump: whether the House can use the courts to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, and whether the House can sue to block Trump's effort to fund border wall construction over Congressional objections. The Friday afternoon announcement wiped out a major victory Trump scored last month when a smaller panel of the same court ruled, 2-1, that the courts should not wade into subpoena fights between Congress and the White House. The appeals court said it will hear arguments, en banc, April 28 in both the McGahn and border wall disputes. There seems to be little chance that the Supreme Court will resolve the issues definitively before the November election, but rulings in the House's favor could lead the justices to intervene with a stay in the coming months. Prospects for Trump prevailing in the cases at the D.C. Circuit look grim. While the active bench of that court leans toward Democratic appointees by a 7-4 margin, the order Friday indicated that both of Trump's nominees--Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao--have recused themselves from both cases.  As a result, the en banc court for McGahn will have only two Republican appointees. One additional GOP appointee, Judge David Sentelle, will join the en banc court considering the border wall funding dispute, the order said. The renewed debate at the D.C. Circuit over critical separation-of-powers issues is set to play out about a month after the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a trio of cases involving demands for access to Trump's personal financial records.  Two of those cases involve subpoenas from House committees. The third was triggered by a subpoena that a local grand jury in New York City issued for Trump's tax and business records. A decision from the Supreme Court in those cases is expected by the end of June. The majority opinion the D.C. Circuit issued last month in the McGahn case said the courts should butt out of subpoena fights between Congress and the executive branch because intervening would effectively shut down the usual process of negotiation between the branches and instead send both sides running to court.  Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also said blessing the subpoena was likely to trigger endless eddies of litigation over individual questions lawmakers wanted to ask McGahn in connection with their investigation into alleged efforts by Trump to obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. However, House lawyers pleaded with the full D.C. Circuit to rehear the case, arguing that bowing out of such fights actually amounts to siding with the White House, since it typically has considerable leverage over testimony and records lawmakers want. House Counsel Douglas Letter also warned that trying to foreclose subpoena litigation could lead to more unpleasant conflicts, like efforts by the House to arrest uncooperative witnesses. The Justice Department contended that McGahn, as a close presidential adviser, was absolutely immune from subpoena. Griffith didn't endorse that position. Judge Karen Henderson, who was on the panel and will be the only other GOP appointee on the en banc court, rejected the absolute immunity argument, but concurred with Griffith that courts shouldn't referee such fights. The only dissenter last month was Judge Judith Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. She said the court was gutting the House's impeachment powers by refusing to enforce the subpoena. The other appeal stems from the House's unsuccessful effort to challenge the plan Trump' announced in 2019 to use over $6 billion from military construction and counterdrug budgets to fund border wall construction even though Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for barrier projects and put strict limits on that money. The move, backed in part by a presidential emergency declaration, spurred a flurry of lawsuits from environmental and human rights groups, states, border residents, and the House itself. All said Trump's actions violated the power of the purse granted to Congress by the Constitution. The House's lawsuit, filed in Washington, found no traction. Last June, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden tossed it out, finding that Congress had no standing to sue Trump administration officials over allegedly unauthorized spending.  The House appealed that ruling, setting in motion arguments that took place before a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel last month and now scheduled to be reprised before the larger, 10-judge court in April.  No decision was rendered by the three-judge panel before Friday's order taking the border wall case en banc. The order said the issue of the House's standing is ""common"" to that case and the dispute over McGahn's testimony. Other suits aimed at blocking Trump's unusual border wall funding plan found greater purchase in the federal courts. Groups suing in California managed to get an injunction against construction, as did by El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights in a suit brought in Texas. However, those victories proved to be short lived, as the Supreme Court blocked the injunction out of California and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the one in Texas. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.","Full appeals court to hear McGahn, border wall cases",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/appeals-court-don-mcgahn-border-wall-cases-128914,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders acknowledged Friday that the novel coronavirus public health crisis had ""radically"" altered the nature of his White House bid ahead a slate of crucial primaries. The remarks from the Vermont senator came after a roughly 15-minute speech he delivered from his hometown of Burlington, where he discussed the “lessons” Americans could learn from the coronavirus and argued that its rapid spread demonstrated the need for his “Medicare for All” policy proposal. But following his brief address, Sanders was pressed by reporters on what the brutal political realities of the pandemic meant for his campaign. “That’s why I’m here today,” he said with a wink and a smile, before turning somber. “You’re right, it has significantly impacted our campaign, as all of you know,” Sanders said, describing his “love” for the massive rallies and more intimate town hall meetings his campaign has begun canceling in the wake of the burgeoning outbreak.  “That is changing, as you’ve indicated correctly,” he said. “Our staff is now, by and large, working at home. So it has radically changed our campaign.”  Leading up to the next four nominating contests Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, Sanders indicated that he would be relying increasingly on the various digital resources of his campaign apparatus in his primary battle against former Vice President Joe Biden.  “What I think we have going for us — which we have always had going for us, but we’re going to have to utilize even more — is our internet capabilities,” Sanders said. He cited his “many, many, many millions” of followers on Twitter and other online platforms, as well as his campaign’s ability to livestream events like his speech Thursday.  “We are in the process of thinking this through,” he added. “But this coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. And that’s hurting.” Sanders was also asked about his goals moving forward in the primary campaign, and whether the worsening coronavirus threat had forced him to rethink his role in the race given the calls he has already faced from some senior Democrats to concede the nomination to Biden. “Well my long-term goal is to win. The short-term goal is to figure out how we deal with the issues that you guys are appropriately raising,” Sanders replied, conceding that “under normal circumstances, I would not be in Burlington today.”  “I would be probably in Ohio, Florida or another state where a primary is coming up. But we can’t do — we’ve decided not to do under the advice of public health officials, not to do rallies, and that’s the right decision,” he continued. “So we are figuring out a way as to how we can best communicate with people, which will certainly be in a very strong way utilizing our social media capabilities.”",Sanders: Coronavirus has 'radically changed our campaign',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-campaign-coronavirus-128767,politico
"Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both acknowledged discussing potential aid from Washington to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, amid a crisis in air travel unlike anything the industry has seen since Sept. 11, 2001. Delta also announced it is cutting 40 percent of its flight capacity, the steepest in its history. The news comes two days after President Donald Trump announced a monthlong halt to U.S.-bound passengers from most of Europe, a stoppage that in one blow decimated many of the industry’s most lucrative international routes. “We are in discussions with the White House and Congress regarding the support they can provide to help us through this period,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees obtained by POLITICO. ""I’m optimistic we will receive their support."" A spokesperson for American Airlines also said Friday that the carrier was involved in early discussions with the government. Airlines have been struggling financially for weeks because of a steep slump in passenger demand as the global pandemic has spread. But Trump’s European travel restrictions pushed them even further into crisis. (Trump said Friday that he may expand the restrictions to include people coming from the United Kingdom.) ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we’ve seen,"" Bastian wrote, noting that bookings are net negative— meaning canceled bookings are more than new bookings — at Delta. ""We’re currently seeing more cancellations than new bookings over the next month,"" added. On Thursday, an administration official told POLITICO that ""Congress really will have little choice to act or face a significant extinction moment for the airline industry."" Trump's economic aides have been studying how the President George W. Bush administration propped up the airline industry after 9/11. Bastian warned in his memo, though, that the ""form and value"" of help from the government is unpredictable. ""We can’t put our company’s future at risk waiting on aid from our government.""

"President Donald Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump stayed home from work at the White House on Friday as a precaution after meeting with an Australian official who has coronavirus.  “The White House is aware that [Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton] tested positive for COVID-19. He was asymptomatic during the interaction,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. ""Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine. She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.” Last week Ivanka, Attorney General William Barr and Trump aides including Kellyanne Conway met with Dutton in Washington for a meeting about online child exploitation. In a statement released on Friday on Twitter, Dutton said he “woke up with a temperature and sore throat” and confirmed he has the coronavirus.  “I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for COVID-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive,” Dutton said in a statement.  In a photo posted on Twitter by the Australian Embassy in the U.S., Dutton is seen standing next to Ivanka and the other officials. Barr also stayed at home on Friday, according to Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec, who said he is “feeling great and not showing any symptoms” and has consulted with the CDC. “CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point,” Kupec said.  Ivanka and Barr are the latest people close to the president who have potentially been exposed to the virus and have stayed home as a precaution. Republicans close to the president -- Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Matt Getz of Florida, Rep. Doug Collins of Florida, and incoming Chief of Staff Mark Meadows – all self-quarantined after being exposed to a person with the virus at CPAC.   Trump was in contact last weekend with at least two people who have now tested positive for COVID-19 after a meeting with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro at his home and sanctuary in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago. One of Bolsonaro’s aides, communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, and the Mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, were both at Mar-a-Lago and said they have the virus, although they are reportedly doing well.   Despite the close encounters, the White House has not signaled that the president has been tested for the virus, which has now infected over 1,000 people in the United States and has spread to almost every corner of the world.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the lead experts on Trump’s coronavirus task force, said on MSNBC Friday that “yes,” someone who has been exposed to a person with the virus should isolate themselves and find a test, but would not speak directly about the president’s situation.  “You know, I leave that to the president’s physician,” Fauci said. “They have very good White House physician and physician staff there, so when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician.”",Ivanka Trump stayed home from White House after exposure to person with coronavirus ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/ivanka-trump-coronavirus-exposure-128721,politico
"At 73 years old, President Donald Trump is a prime target for a contagious disease that falls hard on the elderly. Multiple people in the Trump orbit are infected. Trump posed for a picture alongside an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who has tested positive. (Bolsonaro, who is in the same picture, denies reports that he’s positive.) The president spoke at the CPAC conference earlier this month where, as was later reported, an attendee carrying a gold-plated VIP ticket was later diagnosed as virus-positive. Other attendees of the conference, including incoming chief of staff Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), and Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) exercised medical caution with self-quarantine. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.),who was at Mar-a-Lago at the same time as the Brazilian visitors, is also self-quarantining. And both Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump recently spent time with an Australian minister who subsequently tested positive. It’s almost as if the virus has circled Trump. At this point, it’s not morbid, just good planning, to say the administration has no excuse not to start making plans for the chance that the virus might incapacitate Trump. The White House has not exactly been transparent about whether Trump has been tested. But his age and his clinical obesity mean that his system would be fighting an infection from a trench: It can put older patients on ventilators, sometimes for four weeks, even if they do recover. The Constitution has a provision for this, of course: The 25th Amendment allows an orderly transfer of power if the president can’t execute his duties. The obstacle to such a smooth transition isn’t the system: It’s Trump. Trump himself never admits weakness. As a businessman and a leader, he resists looking too far ahead, and is known for simply dodging and weaving to keep bad news at bay—a quality that has already served him badly in handling the biggest crisis of his presidency. As for the people around him: He hand-picks his staff for personal loyalty over any particular principles, and replaces them when they fail to exhibit the blind allegiance he desires. The 25th Amendment has been invoked only a few times, always voluntarily by presidents themselves when they’ve undergone surgery. If it’s hard to imagine Trump himself ceding power for any reason, it’s even harder to imagine the amendment’s powerful Section 4 being invoked, transferring power from the president without his consent. It requires consensus of the people close to him—specifically, “the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide.” The idea that Pence and the Trump Cabinet would automatically step in and unseat their boss should Trump contract the virus—and, say, be hospitalized without handing over the reins—cannot be assumed. Even if they did get together and agree to hand Pence control, it is Trump, and no one else, who has groomed and cultivated the political base that would likely flip out and scream “coup” the moment it happened. The 25th Amendment has already come up in Trump’s presidency. It received heavy review and inspection in the early semesters of Donald Trump’s term when top White House aides fretted that the chief executive might have only one oar in the water. Trump’s erratic, impulsive, unstable ways—his firing of FBI Director James B. Comey; his divulging of classified information to Russian diplomats in the Oval Office; his request for “loyalty” from Comey, in particular—reportedly prompted discussions about using the 1967 amendment to replace him with Vice President Mike Pence. But just because Trump, Pence and the Cabinet might not do the right thing doesn’t mean we shouldn’t secure a promise from them that an orderly transition of power is being sketched out should serious illness strike the president. To prevent a destabilizing vacancy in the most powerful office in the world, Trump must volunteer that he will use the 25th Amendment to turn over the powers of the presidency to Pence if he becomes seriously ill. Under the amendment, he can retrieve these powers by simply writing a letter expressing that he has regained sufficient health to serve as president. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used the amendment to temporarily delegate presidential powers during medical incidents during their terms. Trump must also encourage Pence to exercise a transition of power should he become gravely ill.  Invoking the 25th Amendment is nowhere near staging a coup, as Trump ultraloyalists might holler. The amendment allows the president to appeal to Congress, and both chambers must embrace the action by two-thirds majorities to maintain the vice president’s assumption of the office. Across the nation, people are having a similar talk with family and friends. They’re updating wills. They’re making promises should the illness strike them. They’re talking to their children. For the well-being of the country, to guarantee confidence in the continuity of government, and in the name of sanity, Trump, Pence and his Cabinet need to have this conversation in calm and confident tones with the citizenry. ****** Include me in your will.

"President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to offset lagging coronavirus testing and unlock billions of dollars — accelerating a response plan that has faced weeks of criticism. Trump touted partnerships with private companies that he claimed would allow patients to learn if they need to be tested and locate a testing site, some of which will be drive-thru facilities at big box retailers across the country. “To unleash the full power of the federal government under this effort today, I'm officially declaring a national emergency,” he said at an announcement in the Rose Garden. “Two very big words.” Trump insisted the move would eradicate the testing shortcomings that health experts say hindered the country’s ability to contain the virus when it first appeared on American shores. In recent days, Trump’s health officials have warned Americans to expect the situation to worsen, spurring much of the country’s public spaces to shutter — professional sports have been suspended, concert halls are closed until further notice and many Americans have been asked to self-isolate. Yet even as Trump unleashed $50 billion in government funding, the announcement had a distinct market-first flavor. Trump outlined a series of agreements with private companies, including Google, Target and Walmart, to facilitate swifter coronavirus testing for Americans. Target and Walmart said they will set aside parking lot space for testing sites, while Google pledged to set up a website to determine whether a person needs a test, and where one is available. “Very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites,” said Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump put in charge of the administration’s coronavirus task force. Trump said he expected 1.4 million additional tests to be available next week and 5 million within a month — even as he cautioned against everyone rushing to get tested. “We don’t want everybody taking this test,” he said. “It’s totally unnecessary.” Trump has faced condemnation over the administration's failure to provide adequate testing and resources for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people worldwide and infected tens of thousands. Health specialists have also reprimanded Trump for repeatedly downplaying what has now been deemed a global pandemic. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said of the government’s struggles to produce enough tests, blaming existing rules set by prior administration for limiting his options. “We were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” And he claimed to not know that a pandemic preparedness team within the National Security Council was scrapped in 2018. Trump called a question about it “nasty” at a news conference.  “I didn’t do it,” he said. Still, Trump's executive actions on Friday received a positive response on Wall Street and even among Democrats. A faltering stock market swiftly rebounded as Trump was speaking, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring nearly 2,000 points, or more than 9 percent, the largest percentage gain since the 2008 crisis. The comeback reversed nearly all of Thursday’s tumble, which was the worst since the 1987 market crash. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y,), who had urged Trump to act more forcefully, offered rare praise for the president but warned him not to go too far. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” he said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) offered no comment. In addition to his executive actions, Trump has pressed Congress for an economic stimulus package that could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. Late Friday, Pelosi announced that she had clinched a deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a package meant to provide paid leave for workers, expand food aid and support widespread testing for the illness at no cost to patients. Only hours earlier, Trump had said during his press conference that he did not yet support the latest version of the bill.  “We just don't think they're giving enough,” he said. “We don't think the Democrats are giving enough.” Friday's national emergency declaration was considerably different than one the White House earlier this week had signaled was being prepared. A White House aide involved in the coronavirus response told POLITICO on Wednesday that Trump would sign a limited emergency declaration that only addressed the faltering economy by unleashing billions of dollars for loans to small businesses and to cover missed paychecks for hourly workers. But Democrats and many health care industry leaders were pressuring Trump to declare a more expansive emergency to help hard-hit states build mobile hospitals and shelters, while assisting with public safety and other issues.  White House documents referenced both the Stafford Act, which is designed to activate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Emergencies Act, the same law he invoked last year to repurpose government funds for construction of a southern border. But the president only said his order would increase the powers of the Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency thus far in the administration's coronavirus response. Under Friday's order, HHS will be able to waive certain Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program requirements in an effort to bypass time-consuming regulations. Separately, Trump said the federal government will waive interest on federal student loans and would purchase additional crude oil for the nation’s reserves. “This will pass,” he said. “This will pass through. We're going to be even stronger for it. We learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned.” Previously, Trump had been reluctant to declare a more sweeping national emergency, fearful of stoking panic with such a dramatic step. But his thinking evolved as the American coronavirus caseload soared past 1,600 this week, with public health officials warning the country to expect a spike in the coming days. For weeks, Trump has tried to reassure Americans that the widening outbreak is under control. But the situation has escalated in recent days. The stock market has dropped in record numbers not seen since the 2008 recession, and much of the country — from Disney World to professional sports leagues, museums and concert halls — has shut down. Across the U.S., the coronavirus has now killed more than 40 people and health officials have warned that the situation will worsen. Trump made another attempt to calm Wall Street during a brief prime-time Oval Office address on Wednesday. But he instead caused more confusion when he misrepresented the contours of a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from Europe and misstated that insurance companies had promised to fully pay for people’s coronavirus treatment. Friday's declaration builds on a previous, agency-specific ""public health emergency"" declaration HHS made in January. The move unlocked some initial federal money and resources. But Friday’s two designations are much broader. Still, some disaster management experts were disappointed that Trump on Friday did not appear to task FEMA — the agency that oversees hurricane, tornado and flood response — with leading the government’s coronavirus response plan. “FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis,” said Tim Manning, a former FEMA deputy administrator. “If there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved. I’m not sure how it could be done mechanically or legally without FEMA.” FEMA has previously helped with government responses to other insidious dangerous outbreaks, including SARS, MERS and Ebola. While previous presidents have made emergency declarations “virus threat” disasters — Bill Clinton did it for West Nile virus under the Stafford Act — it is rare, former FEMA officials say.",Trump declares national emergency in latest bid to combat coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/coronavirus-emergency-declaration-trump-128530,politico

"Asia’s richest man announced his intention on Friday to ship 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.  Jack Ma’s charitable foundation and his China-based company's foundation, the Alibaba Foundation, have also sourced and donated supplies to other countries being hit by the virus, including Japan, Korea, Italy, Iran and Spain.  The donation comes amid testing delays across the U.S. as state officials scramble amid a shortage of lab materials — sparking concerns that health officials are undercounting the number of Americans with the virus.  “Drawing from my own country’s experience, speedy and accurate testing and adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus,” the statement said. “We hope that our donation can help Americans fight against the pandemic!” Ma’s announcement also comes as Trump aides and allies cast blame on China, with some officials calling it “the Wuhan virus” — a reference to the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the disease. National security adviser Robert O’Brien has accused China of covering up a health crisis, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has labeled the outbreak the “Wuhan coronavirus.”  “The crisis presents a huge challenge to all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we face today can no longer be resolved by any individual country,” Ma said in the statement. “Rather, we need to combat the virus by working hand-in-hand. At this moment, we can’t beat this virus unless we eliminate boundaries to resources and share our know-how and hard-earned lessons.”","Chinese businessman to donate 500,000 test kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. ",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/jack-ma-coronavirus-test-kits-128522,politico
"Louisiana will postpone its presidential primary, which was originally scheduled for April 4, as part of the state government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The state is the first in the nation to postpone a primary since the outbreak of the virus. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the contest will be delayed until June 20.  “Safe and secure elections also mean safety to the people of Louisiana,” Ardoin said at a press conference. Several states are voting before Louisiana, including four holding primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. But officials in those states indicated that Election Day will go on as planned. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from Arizona Secretary of State Kathy Hobbs, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, Illinois Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose read. The Wyoming Democratic Party, which is holding its caucuses on April 4, also canceled the in-person portion of their upcoming vote. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Louisiana moving its primary could cause a major headache for the state for the Democratic National Convention. As written, the national party’s delegate selection rules mandate that states hold their nominating contests by June or face delegate penalties. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9th. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" State election officials around the country have been scrambling to make adjustments ahead of their primaries, including moving polling places away from locations concentrated with high-risk individuals, like nursing homes. The top election official in Arizona's Maricopa County, where just under 60 percent of the state's registered Democrats live, announced that his office would mail ballots to ""traditional Election Day voters"" eligible to vote in Tuesday's Democratic primary but who do not normally get absentee ballots mailed to them. Voters are encouraged to not mail the ballots back. Instead, officials say mailing out ballots before Election Day will allow voters to drop off already filled-out ballots in an effort to limit interactions and promote social distancing. Ohio, which is holding its primary on Tuesday, is moving nearly 150 polling places. Similar measures have been taken by some municipalities in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, which will also vote that day. “We’re seeing that this public health moment presents challenges for elections officials,” Kristen Clarke, the president & executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said. “And its having a cascading effect … By next week, on Tuesday, we’ll see coronavirus having an even broader impact on how elections are playing out.” Aaron M. Sellers, a spokesperson for the Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio, said he started receiving panicked calls over the weekend from directors of elder care facilities.  “They want to limit residents’ exposure to visitors because that’s such a vulnerable population,” he said in an interview with POLITICO.  The Centers for Disease Control recently issued guidance targeted to election officials that urges states and counties to encourage mail-in voting and early voting as much as possible, in an effort to “minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling stations.” The CDC also urged poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect polling stations, “limit nonessential visitors” and encourage as much social distancing as possible. Election administrators and party officials in most states have also been pushing voters to take advantage of early and mail voting, when possible. However, laws regulating voting in any other way other than in person, on Election Day, vary wildly by state. “Staffing [flexibility], more utilization of mail ballots, being concerned about infection, providing disinfectant, all of these things are ideas that supervisors of elections are trying to implement,” Ion Sancho, a former longtime supervisor of elections in Leon County, Fla., said. “And at the last second, this is not going to be simple. This is not going to be easy. But we're going to get through it.” But the last-minute changes present significant challenges as well. In Ohio, Sellers said his county was not able to find replacement polling sites on such short notice, and will instead consolidate with neighboring precincts.  “It’s incredibly difficult to find good locations that are ADA-compliant and have ample parking on such short notice, plus they have to want us to be there,” he said.  Election administrators are also grappling with another coronavirus-related challenge: a dependence on elderly poll workers. “We’re getting people calling us who are apprehensive, saying, ‘Hey I just don’t feel comfortable working the polls,’” Sellers said. “So we’re finding additional people to chip in.”",Louisiana postpones primary as states scramble to adjust to coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/louisiana-postpones-presidential-primary-due-to-coronavirus-128514,politico
"The leader of a libertarian-leaning tech group is stepping down as its president after tweeting that it would be “poetic justice” if President Donald Trump died from the coronavirus, the group confirmed Friday. Berin Szóka, president of Washington-based think tank TechFreedom, will be taking an indefinite sabbatical to write a book on tech policy, as first reported by POLITICO earlier Friday. Shane Tews, a longtime member of the group's board, will lead the organization in his stead.  The move deals a blow to one of the tech industry’s staunchest defenders in Washington, where Szóka has served as its combative and outspoken leader for nearly a decade. Szóka and TechFreedom, which receives funding from at least one tech giant, Google, have been relentless allies of Silicon Valley, particularly as it has faced calls for increased regulation in Washington in recent years. The group has opposed efforts to create more stringent rules for privacy and online speech, among other issues. But Szóka has also been a frequent critic of the president, delivering at times scathing rebukes of his actions on social media. The planned shake-up comes just four days after Szóka prompted a firestorm of criticism online by suggesting that the president succumbing to the virus would be fitting. “Serious question: could there possibly [sic] any greater poetic justice in the universe than for Trump to die of the #CPACvirus?” Szóka tweeted late Monday. Recent reports that an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference was later diagnosed with Covid-19 sparked fears that the president may have been exposed to the virus. Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had contact with the president as well before entering self-quarantine due to possible exposure. The Szóka tweet immediately drew condemnations online, racking up hundreds of negative replies within minutes and some calls for his resignation. Szóka later deleted the tweet, and has since issued an apology. “Earlier this week, I sent a thoughtless tweet making an inappropriate comment about the President that I deeply regret,” he tweeted Thursday. “I was wrong to tweet it and deleted it. Again, I apologize.”",Tech think tank chief to step down after Trump death tweet,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/think-tank-chief-to-step-down-after-trump-death-tweet-128397,politico
"In the early hours of Friday, U.S. and British aircraft conducted multiple airstrikes on the missile storage sites of the Iraqi militia group Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian group that was also hit by unclaimed airstrikes in Syria the day before. Until Wednesday, when a rocket attack killed two Americans and one British service member on a sprawling base north of Baghdad, there hadn’t been much noise from Tehran since its reprisal in early January after the U.S. killed Qassem Soleimani. This week’s attack, which was meticulously planned and clearly not the work of the ramshackle remnants of the Islamic State, changed that. A truck with two rows of rocket-launching tubes discreetly installed in the flatbed, approached the base undetected and fired the rockets in one sudden salvo.  As someone who has gotten lost while walking around the maze of concrete barriers that make up the 15-square-mile Camp Taji base, I can attest to the great accuracy of the strike. Taji is massive, and the strike hit at just the right moment and just the right spot, probably guided by a drone or human agent.  The next day, Kataib Hezbollah (KH), the Iraqi Shiite militia closest to Iran, praised the attack as an act of the pro-Iranian “resistance” against U.S. “occupation”, a surefire sign that pro-Iranian militias were behind the strike and the Shiite militia version of “humble bragging.” By that stage, either U.S. or Israeli aircraft had already struck back at KH and other Shiite militias, albeit just over the border in Syria late on Wednesday, killing around two dozen fighters and wounding many more. The strikes, and the subsequent round launched very early Friday morning, were reminiscent of the United States’ retaliatory attacks in late December on KH after the militia group caused the last U.S. death in Iraq in a rocket attack on December 27.  Friday morning’s strikes may not be the end in a new tit-for-tat cycle that has the potential to spark a wider conflict. Iran is escalating through its Iraqi militias because it wants to raise pressure to evict U.S. forces from Iraq and to threaten Iraqi leaders ahead of next week’s selection of a replacement for resigned Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Thursday: “You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” But how can deterrence be established quickly to end the cycle of attacks and prevent further loss of American lives? The deaths of two U.S. personnel—one military, one contractor—at Taji comes days after the March 8 deaths of two U.S. Marine special forces operators in a firefight with the Islamic State in northern Iraq. The two episodes underline the complexity of what the U.S. military is attempting to do in today’s Iraq. The mission of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR, or the coalition, for short) is still to defeat the last remnants of the Islamic State. In recent weeks, the coalition has ramped up its special forces raiding alongside Iraqi commandos, achieving significant successes against Islamic State leadership targets. When the U.S. gets on a roll, triggering new raids on the basis of data from laptops and phones recovered in each prior raid, terrorists face the most unrelenting foe in the world. But boosted effectiveness comes at a cost of added risk, as the March 8 deaths illustrate. To complicate matters, Iran-backed militias like KH are seeking to lever the U.S.-backed coalition out of Iraq by any means necessary, regardless of the coalition’s contribution to the anti-Islamic State struggle. Militias like KH sought the removal of international forces long before they killed an American on December 27, before they themselves were struck on December 29, and before their patriarchs, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia chieftain Aby Mahdi al-Muhandis, were killed by the U.S. on January 3 in a Baghdad drone strike. Now the militias are doubling their efforts, including issuing warnings to Iraqi officials and soldiers to distance themselves from the coalition (which they did not). In recent months, KH has threatened Iraqi MPs to vote to remove U.S. forces (enough of them resisted this call to prevent a vote with quorum) and threatened Iraq’s president Barham Salih if he met with President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum (he met Trump anyway).  Now KH is also issuing statements vetoing certain candidates for Iraq’s imminent selection of a new prime minister, suggesting which candidate should be picked (current premier Adel Abdal-Mahdi), and explicitly suggesting how the country’s most senior religious leaders should rule on the matter.  This is all unprecedented territory in Iraq, particularly the openness of the threats, similar to Iran’s recent elections where the regime blocked over 7,000 candidates for Parliament and invalidated a third of sitting MPs from seeking reelection.  The U.S. has clearly not yet deterred the militias from killing Americans and the result is that U.S. forces in Iraq are not being protected by either the Iraqi government or, ultimately, by our own government. This is not a sustainable situation. What can change? Last night’s strikes on KH missile and rocket bases were an attempt to take the high road, but the lack of large secondary explosions suggests that KH had evacuated its valuable weapons long before the strike. Iran’s militia proxies in Iraq can trade empty buildings or even two dozen of their own rank and file for three Anglo-American fatalities all day, every day. This a game we will lose. The right approach probably lies somewhere between the high and low roads, with very prompt, decisive and unclaimed attacks demonstrated against some senior Iraqi militia leaders in order to make others think very seriously about their personal future. But high-value leadership targets — which Iran and the militias do value — are generally not available to hit the day after Americans are killed: they are keeping their heads down. Congress and the administration need to sit privately and agree to some ground rules for the use of military force that allow the U.S. military to delink the timing of deterrent strikes, so that we can strike the right targets when they become available, to deter militia attacks that are highly likely to come otherwise. In parallel, the U.S. should toughen its mindset, quietly bringing the force protection assets into Iraq that it needs (i.e., Patriot missiles and anti-rocket close-in defenses) without further consultation with an Iraqi government that would rather adopt a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach.  And finally, the U.S. should let the militias keep over-reaching, keep showing their hand as would-be dictators under Iran’s control, while the U.S.-led coalition keeps helping Iraq to defeat the Islamic State. This is a game we can win.",How the U.S. Can Stop the Surge of Deadly Rocket Attacks in Iraq,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/iraq-airstrikes-shiite-militias-islamic-state-128210,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued Friday that the coronavirus pandemic presents ""a great investment opportunity,"" insisting that global markets spooked by the public health crisis will rebound eventually. ""This is a short-term issue. It may be a couple of months, but we're going to get through this, and the economy will be stronger than ever,"" Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. ""You know, I look back at people who bought stocks after the crash in 1987, people who bought stocks after the financial crisis,"" he continued. ""For long-term investors, this will be a great investment opportunity."" Despite the secretary's optimism, international anxiety over the coronavirus has provoked a historically negative reaction in recent days from Wall Street, alarmed at least in part by President Donald Trump's management of the mushrooming outbreak.  Following the president's prime-time address to the nation Wednesday evening, during which he announced a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from most of Europe, panicked investors triggered a marketwide trading halt for the second time this week and only the third time in history.

"The White House is holding up the nomination for one of the Pentagon’s top intelligence jobs because the official is not considered sufficiently loyal to the president, according to three current and former administration officials. Kathryn Wheelbarger, who has been serving as acting assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs since November 2018, would become the deputy undersecretary of Defense for intelligence if the nomination moves forward. But the holdup comes as President Donald Trump continues a post-impeachment loyalty purge that has already felled two senior Pentagon officials in recent weeks. The post that Wheelbarger would fill is one of 21 senior positions at the Pentagon that are empty or filled on a temporary basis, a record high for the Trump administration. Lawmakers have raised concerns in recent weeks that the department doesn't have enough qualified people in place to tackle the nation's biggest national security problems as it faces a host of crises, from the spread of the coronavirus to a new spike in tensions with Iran. The White House announced its intent to nominate Wheelbarger for the No. 2 position at the Pentagon overseeing military intelligence on Feb. 13, but it has not yet submitted her paperwork to the Senate, a spokesperson for the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed. By contrast, William Gillis, who the president announced would be nominated for assistant secretary of Defense for sustainment on the same day, had his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Wheelbarger, through a Pentagon spokesperson, referred comment to the White House, which declined to comment. In her current acting role, Wheelbarger has been the Pentagon’s point person on a host of issues, from the conflict in Syria to relations with NATO. On Tuesday, she testified alongside U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Frank McKenzie and U.S. Africa Command head Gen. Stephen Townsend on the U.S. peace agreement with Afghanistan, terrorist threats in West Africa and more. In particular, Wheelbarger has been “instrumental and a driving force behind the president’s efforts to seek 2 percent defense funding from NATO allies,” one administration official told POLITICO. “She hammered that message repeatedly.” But the White House is not satisfied that Wheelbarger is sufficiently loyal to the administration, the three current and former officials said. The people pointed to Wheelbarger’s two years spent working for the late Sen. John McCain, who feuded publicly with Trump before his death in 2019, as the root of the current tension. But the administration official said the White House is wrong about Wheelbarger, noting that she has worked for Trump for 50 percent longer than she did for McCain. Wheelbarger also declined to testify before Congress during the impeachment inquiry, the official said, explaining that she and her lawyer convinced congressional staff that she would not be able to provide additional information for the case. This is not the first time the White House has intervened on Pentagon personnel issues. The Trump administration demanded the ouster of John Rood, then-undersecretary of Defense for policy, in February, and has since rejected several of Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s choices to replace him. The White House personnel office, which is led by Trump loyalist John McEntee, put forth its own candidate to replace Rood: Elbridge Colby, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of Defense and is one of the primary authors of the National Defense Strategy. The White House also recently withdrew the nomination of Elaine McCusker to be Pentagon comptroller after emails emerged showing her questioning the administration’s suspension of military aid to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of the impeachment. “Unless you are here to support him personally, he’d rather have gaps,” said one former administration official.",White House holding up DoD nomination amid Trump loyalty purge,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/defense-nomination-trump-loyalty-128244,politico

"President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would eliminate the interest on federal student loans ""until further notice"" as part of a package of emergency executive actions designed to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. “To help our students and their families, I’ve waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies and that will be until further notice,” Trump said during a Rose Garden address where he declared a national emergency. “That’s a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed.” The unprecedented move will provide relief to the more than 42 million Americans who owe more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding federal student loans. But it did not go as far as what some Democrats had proposed, which was a suspension of monthly loan payments or loan forgiveness. The department was considering instructing loan servicers to lower the interest rate on federal loans to zero percent, according to individuals familiar with the plan. Under that approach, a borrower's monthly payment amount would not automatically change, though any payments the borrower did make would likely pay down a greater share of the principal balance. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ""is proud to work with the President in taking decisive action to help students and parents during this national emergency,"" department spokesperson Liz Hill said in a statement. The new policy will be implemented by the Education Department, which was scrambling on Friday to issue instructions and guidance to the companies it hires to manage the monthly payments of borrowers. A department official said that the interest waiver would be automatically applied to all borrowers, effective Friday, even though it may take some another week to fully ""operationalize"" the policy. It's not clear how much money the interest waiver will save borrowers, but it could be billions of dollars, depending on how long the Trump administration keeps the policy in place. In fiscal 2019 alone, the Education Department reported that it charged more than $100 billion in interest on all federal student loans. Federal student loans already offer options for borrowers to defer payments under certain circumstances, including an economic hardship, though interest can continue to accrue. Trump's suspension of interest payments, combined with those existing benefits, could mean that some Americans would be able to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who have long pushed for sweeping student debt relief from the federal government have said in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the need to provide assistance to Americans struggling with monthly loan payments. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a tweet that Trump's action was ""not enough"" to help student loan borrowers. ""Donald Trump & @BetsyDeVosED need to cancel student loans, not just waive interest or suspend payments,"" she said. ""Suspending payments or interest just delays the pain."" However, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) tweeted that it was a ""good step"" and that ""With so much uncertainty in the economy, we need to continue to look at every available means of providing relief."" Senate Democrats earlier this week included a six-month moratorium on some federal student loan payments on their list of items they’d like to see in an economic rescue legislative package. The National Consumer Law Center, which represents low-income student loan borrowers, has also called for a moratorium on student loan payments. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that pausing student loan payments was among the ""list of 50 different items"" that Trump's advisers planned to present to him to shore up the economy and financial markets due to the coronavirus pandemic. “That’ll be something we’re looking at,” Mnuchin said during an interivew on CNBC. “We have lots of authorities,” Mnuchin said, adding that on “things where we don’t have authorities, we’re going to work with both the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis. I can assure you the president is all about action, action, action.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has called for sweeping student loan forgiveness, tweeted earlier in the day that she was ""thankful"" that the Trump administration was ""taking pausing student loan payments seriously."" She called it ""a decisive move that will help stabilize millions of people. We should do it now. There is much more to be done, but every step counts."" The Education Department on Friday was still determining the mechanics of how to carry out Trump's announcement. The department has decided that the policy will automatically apply to all borrowers with federal direct loans, federally held Family Federal Education Loans and federally held Perkins Loans, according to a department official. Borrowers whose loans are in income-based repayment or in forbearance will still qualify. ""This will be operationalized over the next week or so, and it will be retroactive back to today,"" the official said. Borrowers could potentially seek a recalculation of their monthly payment under income-driven repayment plans or some would qualify for forbearance options, which would now be a way to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Much of the implementation will fall to the nine companies that the Education Department hires to collect and manage the payments of federal student loan borrowers. “Servicers and the Department have already begun discussions on how to implement this response to the current situation and we look forward to being able to provide more information to borrowers very shortly,” said Scott Buchanan, the president of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, the trade association that represents the companies. “Servicers will be updating websites in the coming days with information as soon as it becomes available.”",Trump to waive interest on federal student loans 'until further notice',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-administration-student-loan-payments-suspension-128181,politico
"The House passed sweeping legislation Saturday to respond to the coronavirus outbreak battering the nation, an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to expand access to free testing, provide $1 billion in food aid and extend sick leave benefits to vulnerable Americans. The bill's bipartisan passage, 363-40, was virtually assured when President Donald Trump backed the measure — largely hammered out by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and urged Republicans to support the bill. Trump's tweet, just before 9 p.m., capped several days of whiplash as Democrats and the White House appeared, at times, inches from a deal only to see it yanked away amid technical disputes and inconsistent signals from the president. Trump's backing, though, was essential to ensure support from congressional Republicans for the multi-billion dollar plan.  Democrats put the bill on the floor shortly after midnight under an expedited process and passed it in the early hours of Saturday morning, sending it to the Senate, which is expected to take it up as early as Monday.  The bill is the product of a painstaking effort by Pelosi to pass a measure with bipartisan support rather than a doomed Democrat-only bill that the Senate would have immediately spiked.  ""[W]e thought it would be important to show the American people, assure the American people, that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them,"" Pelosi said. ""So we thank our Republicans — those who will be supporting the bill. We appreciate the president joining us with his tweet."" Pelosi said the final bill came together slowly because of a laborious review process in the executive branch, which required approvals from multiple agencies and officials. Pelosi praised Mnuchin for his cooperation, and she acknowledged she never directly spoke with Trump about the bill. ""There was no need for that,"" she said. Alongside Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected House committees to be working through next week's recess on a new bill meant to address the economic damage wrought by coronavirus, which has devastated the airline, hospitality and entertainment industries. For now, though, Democrats said they were pleased to pass a bipartisan plan that they expect to pass overwhelmingly in the House and move through the Senate by Monday. ""I think this was a very good sign of bipartisanship and working together, that we can overcome this virus. We’ve done much bigger things before,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday night, minutes after the deal was announced.  On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted: ""Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!"" Trump's approval came after a hard-fought — and chaotic — day of negotiations, with Democrats and Republicans alike unsure whether the president was on board with the proposal. For several hours before Trump's tweet, talks had devolved into a state of confusion, with key officials on both sides directly contradicting each other on whether a deal exists. ""Because it was essential for us to have legislation pass the House by this weekend, it required intense and constant negotiations for what could have been an elusive agreement,"" Pelosi said in a letter to fellow Democrats after 10 p.m. on Friday, thanking them for their patience amid the frenetic back-and-forth with the administration. Pelosi had announced to her members shortly after 6 p.m. that she had reached a deal. But House Republicans — and even Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat — had said talks were still ongoing and a deal had not yet been reached. Key Republicans cautioned that there were still lingering issues related to a tax credit for paid family sick leave. McCarthy later confirmed that Republicans sought more flexibility for small business owners who would be forced to offer paid leave to affected workers.  Adding to the confusion, Mnuchin surprised even members of his own party by announcing on Fox Business that he had reached an agreement with Pelosi. The Treasury secretary had huddled with Trump just minutes before — a meeting that delayed his appearance on the network for so long that Mnuchin ran out of time to speak before the program ended. Trump eventually tweeted his support hours later, delivering long-awaited relief to hundreds of members and aides who had spent 48 hours in limbo awaiting any updates about the status of the funding package. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,"" Trump tweeted. ""I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"" One of the other major obstacles involved the president's personal demand for a payroll tax cut in this package. That idea has little support on Capitol Hill, and Democrats have already said it would be debated as part of future coronavirus crisis-related legislation at a later date. McCarthy, who met with Trump and Mnuchin multiple times in the last 24 hours, confirmed that Trump had sought the last-minute addition, and said Republicans would push for it in Congress's next tranche of economic relief, which could come later this month or in April. ""I believe this will not be the only one,"" McCarthy said, alluding to future aid packages related to the outbreak. ""This is something that the president wants, we would have liked to have that as well. I think that would have taken a little more time."" Mnuchin earlier in the talks had also expressed concerns that a tax credit to offset the cost of Democratic-proposed sick leave provisions wouldn't work as advertised.  During Trump's White House press conference to announce a national emergency declaration on Friday afternoon, the president complained, ""We don't think the Democrats are giving enough,"" even as Capitol Hill Republicans had been framing the differences as largely technical. Pelosi and Mnuchin then got on the phone again to try to finalize an agreement. The last remaining issues came down to how businesses can receive a tax credit for providing paid sick days and emergency leave for workers who are suffering from the coronavirus or helping take care of family members who contract the disease.  Pelosi and Mnuchin exchanged at least 20 phone calls on Thursday and Friday as they tried to hammer out a proposal that Trump could support.  Both Republicans and Democrats in the House insisted that they would not leave Washington until they could approve the massive package, which would work to both stem the outbreak by offering free testing and offering paid time off, while shoring up support systems for low-income workers, including school lunch meals and unemployment insurance. The legislation includes 14 paid sick days for employees, as well as three months of paid emergency leave throughout the coronavirus crisis. Employers will be reimbursed for some of these costs through tax credits. At GOP insistence, the emergency leave provision will expire in a year. And Republicans were able to insert language exempting smaller businesses from the requirements. The legislation helps provide free food for children whose schools are closed during the crisis, as well as other initiatives to make sure seniors and food banks get help as well. One of the biggest provisions involves free testing — which has been one of the major shortcomings in the U.S. response to the outbreak so far. ""This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,"" Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues announcing the agreement. ""To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge."" The House plans to go into recess for a week. That break, though, may be extended if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Hoyer, who sets the floor schedule, has said Democrats and Republicans are taking the situation day by day and consulting with medical experts and Capitol safety officials. The package comes amid a sense of deep unease on Capitol Hill with both the growing outbreak and the chaotic way that negotiations were led. Several House Democrats expressed complaints about the process, including Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who wrote on Twitter: ""We have ~46% of the House awaiting the @potus to tweet support before they’ll vote, and 100% of the House afforded an hour or so to read and consider one of the most important measures on which we’ll ever vote. It’s not how good governance should work, even during a pandemic."" Pelosi acknowledged that the negotiations were not ideal, suggesting that future legislation would be drafted and approved in a different fashion. ""As we proceed with further legislation, we will do so happily under a different timetable and continue to welcome any suggestions you have,"" Pelosi wrote in her Friday night letter to colleagues. The anxiety has also been compounded by the growing numbers of lawmakers and aides who are intentionally isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus. A staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) has tested positive for coronavirus, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced Friday morning that he would be extending his self quarantine until March 17 “out of an abundance of caution.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told POLITICO he is consulting with doctors on what he should do after news came out that a Spanish right wing politician, Santiago Abascal, he met with on March 2 tested positive for the coronavirus. He said he’s sure he shook Abscal’s hand but added he “feels fine.” He’s currently staying home and has canceled all events in his home state.  A spokesman for Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who also met with Abascal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Smith is doing.  More than 1,400 people in the U.S. have been infected, though many health experts fear that number is dramatically undercounted given the lack of availability of testing.

"The U.S. is shoring up its defenses in the Middle East after tit-for-tat attacks between the U.S. military and an Iran-backed Shia militia group stoked new tensions in the region this week, the top U.S. general in the region announced Friday. Following the Wednesday rocket attack on Camp Taji, Iraq, that killed U.S. and British service members and a retaliatory U.S. and British airstrike on five locations in Iraq on Thursday, the U.S. military will continue to operate two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Harry S. Truman, Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. This is the first period of extended dual U.S. carrier operations in the Middle East since 2012, he said. McKenzie stressed the symbolic significance of keeping two U.S. carriers in the region, noting that the vessel ""is a floating piece of American sovereignty."" ""We know the Iranians watch them very closely,"" he said. In addition, the U.S. is moving Patriot missile defense systems, which are designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles of the type used by Iran, into Iraq. They may be joined by more weapon systems for countering rockets, artillery and mortars, known as C-RAM, McKenzie said. C-RAM is designed to knock down lower-altitude weapons such as the 107mm Katyusha rockets fired at Camp Taji on Wednesday, but they ""are not a panacea,"" he cautioned. Roughly 90,000 U.S. forces are operating in the area overseen by U.S. Central Command, including the Middle East and Afghanistan, up from the 80,000 that were there before the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike in January. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that some of these troops had begun to head home after several months without a significant attack; it is not yet clear if this reduction will continue. McKenzie declined to directly blame Iran for the attack, but noted that Kataib Hezbollah, the Shia militia group that launched the rocket barrage on Wednesday, is ""closely linked"" to Tehran. Kataib Hezbollah has been involved in 12 rocket attacks against coalition forces in the last six months, including a December attack on Kirkuk that killed an American contractor and led to a series of escalations that brought Washington and Tehran to the brink of war. The U.S. and British airstrikes launched on Thursday successfully hit and destroyed all five targets, all of which were Kataib Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, McKenzie said, noting that he expects minimal collateral damage. ""We believe that this is going to have an effect on deterring future strikes of this nature,"" McKenzie said. ""We've seen what happens in the past when you don’t respond.""",U.S. boosts forces in Middle East as Iran situation reignites,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/us-forces-middle-east-128143,politico

"In the weeks since the coronavirus outbreak first reached the United States, @realDonaldTrump has launched a barrage of more than 50 tweets on the growing pandemic, initially offering a rosy assessment of the growing health crisis—assuring Americans that it will “all work out well,” that the outbreak was spreading “very slowly in the U.S.” and that it’s “very much under control”—even as the death toll rose and the number of cases ballooned. In recent days, Trump has taken a more serious tone about the crisis, advocating for policy responses and travel bans, but even the news conference announcing his national emergency declaration ended with a jaunty exclamation point. That’s Trump himself. But what about his Twitterverse? The president follows only 47 accounts on Twitter, a collection of family members, conservative pundits, administration officials and Trump-brand properties.  Even as health experts and mainstream reporters have grown increasingly anxious about the White House’s response to the coronavirus pandemic—and have taken to using their own Twitter accounts to share hand-washing videos and urgent warnings from doctors overseas—when Trump opens his own Twitter feed, he scrolls through something very different. The picture Trump sees, in a nutshell: That the coronavirus crisis is someone else’s fault (China, Joe Biden, etc.), that he’s doing a great job responding to it, and that a Trump-hating media is just fanning the flames.  “The American people have seen once again that President @realDonaldTrump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people,” tweeted Vice President Mike Pence. “Remember Democrats Pushed Impeachment While Coronavirus Spread,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday morning, with a link to a Breitbart column.  “@realDonaldTrump will use every tool available to protect the American worker as he safeguards the health of all,” tweeted Ivanka Trump on Tuesday.  As Trump faces the biggest public health crisis of his presidency, a reading of dozens of tweets from the president’s favorite Twitter users over the past week shows his allies shaping Trump’s feed into five main coronavirus narratives: While Trump has come under increased pressure to respond more forcefully to the outbreak, his allies have taken to Twitter to frame the coronavirus as a foreign threat that spiraled out of control because of a bungled international response.  “Remember, China initially REFUSED to allow the CDC into Wuhan,” conservative activist and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec said in a post retweeted into the president’s feed by his son Donald Jr.  “Inside China's high-stakes campaign to smear the United States over coronavirus,” read the headline of a Fox News article in the president’s feed.  “POTUS was right to restrict travel from China in January, and now there is more evidence that @realDonaldTrump made the right call restricting travel from Europe, too,” tweeted Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee.  “President Trump must take China on here—they created this health crisis, now they’re claiming America is to blame. Typical communist ploy. #Wuhancoronavirus,” tweeted Fox News personality Laura Ingraham.  The president’s allies were also quick to dogpile on 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who was vice president during the 2009 H1N1/swine flu pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic. Even so, former President Barack Obama has remained relatively unscathed by attacks in the Trump Twitterverse, which remains focused on Biden.  “When Biden was vice president, swine flu infected 61 million Americans and killed 12,000,” Ryan Saavedra, a reporter with the conservative online outlet the Daily Wire, wrote in a post retweeted into Trump’s feed. A few hours later, Trump himself took a swipe at Biden, blaming the former vice president for the deaths of thousands of people during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  “President @realDonaldTrump acted early and decisively... His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears,” tweeted Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, quoting the campaign's communications director.  “When @JoeBiden was faced with a public health crisis on H1N1, he pushed the panic button and the White House had to cover it,” read a message retweeted by Donald Jr.  Other tweets in the president’s news feed framed recent comments from Biden opposing xenophobia as opposition to Trump’s temporary ban on travel from China.  “If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would have contracted the virus faster,” a Trump campaign account tweeted. And in response to a Biden speech in which the former vice president criticized the president for labeling COVID-19 a “foreign virus,” Laura Ingraham tweeted: “Yeah, Joe! Let’s throw open our borders, our airports, our ports to anyone and everyone—that will really stem the infection rate!” Critique of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is largely absent from his Twitter feed. Instead, his allies have heaped praise on the administration’s response.  “Deeply impressive extraordinary partnership of America’s best and brightest business & government gathered at White House under leadership of @realDonaldTrump & @VP,” tweeted Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera after Friday’s national emergency declaration. “They and we are going to kick #Corona’s ass.” “This is a very good call,” conservative political commentator Eric Bolling tweeted on Friday in response to reports that Trump was planning to declare a national emergency.  “This is the leadership @realDonaldTrump was elected to provide,” tweeted Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, after the president’s Oval Office address on Wednesday night. “Acting early & decisively he put the U.S. on much better footing than other nations in handling the coronavirus.” “President Trump is exactly right: ‘smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,’” tweeted Congressman Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican close to the White House. “The President’s actions are proactive and decisive. This is exactly what we need to keep Americans safe and healthy.”  And a tweet from Eric Trump shared simply the headline of an adulatory New York Post column: “Trump passes coronavirus test with flying colors.”  The president’s eldest son, Donald Jr., has led the Trump Twitterverse’s charge against the mainstream press’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In his posts and retweets, he’s accused news outlets of stoking panic and helping China spread propaganda. “That the US media is trying to run with the Chinese propaganda that ‘China bought us time’ is a new low even for them,” Donald Jr. tweeted in response to a New York Times op-ed. “F-you!” “The media has thrown everything at [Trump] and none of it has stuck,” said YouTube personality Dave Rubin in a tweet shared by Donald Jr. “So now they have a vested interest in spreading panic, rejoicing over market drops and sewing general chaos.” “This Chinese propaganda about the origin of the coronavirus is being directly amplified and aided by the U.S. media, which is censoring anyone who notes the Wuhan origin of the coronavirus,” said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist and conspiracy theorist, in a post retweeted by Donald Jr.  “CNN is literally taking its talking points from the Chinese government,” read another Cernovich tweet shared by the president’s son. Other accounts followed by the president sounded a similar tone. “Erring on the side of maximum transparency is a good thing for the White House given the mass hysteria being stoked by the partisans in media and politics with [the] goal of affecting the election,” tweeted Laura Ingraham.  “I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using [coronavirus] as a tool to politicize things and to scare people,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet shared by McDaniel. “It's not responsible. This is not the time for this.” During a March 4 phone call with Sean Hannity, Trump falsely implied the coronavirus outbreak was not as bad as the seasonal flu—an idea he may have picked up from his Twitter followers, who have downplayed the virus’ threat. “They say the mortality rate for Coronavirus is higher than the flu,” tweeted Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. “Consider though that we have a flu vaccine and yet in 2019, 16,000 Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have that vaccine. The flu would be a pandemic.”  “The word ‘pandemic’ is scary, but as @drsanjaygupta points out, it doesn’t speak to mortality rates, only to global scope of infection,” Ingraham tweeted in late February. “As @CDCgov notes, actual mortality rates or coronavirus is very low.” On Friday morning, Ingraham tweeted a link to an article headlined: “Coronavirus: Facts vs. Panic,” which stated “most people who get coronavirus have mild or no symptoms” and “most around the world diagnosed from January-March 1 have already recovered.”  “Great time to fly if not in at-risk population!” Ingraham wrote Friday from the aisle seat of a Chicago-bound United flight.",What Trump’s Twitter Feed Tells Him About the Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-twitter-feed-covid-19-129170,politico
"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Trump’s monumental challenge: Rescuing industries in free fall,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show fealty to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says ‘well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made healthcare an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain, said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico

"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac, the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by the three largest credit reporting agencies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. Fair Isaac and VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico
"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development will leave the job at the end of this month, two people familiar with the move confirmed Friday, marking a high-level departure from one of the agencies tasked with responding to the global coronavirus outbreak.  Former GOP Rep. Mark Green is expected to submit his resignation to President Donald Trump early next week, according to a senior administration official, who said USAID Deputy Administrator Bonnie Glick, a Trump loyalist and former State Department foreign service officer, will take Green’s place as acting head.  Green already informed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, with whom he has worked closely on women’s global development programs, of his decision to step down.  “His plans have been in place for awhile, but he began telling folks last week,” said a person familiar with Green’s departure.  The outgoing USAID chief, who has been with the agency since Aug. 2017, is expected to be named president of the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Green previously served as president of the International Republican Institute, an organization once chaired by the late Arizona Sen. John McCain. The D.C.-based think tank lost its executive director Kurt Volker, who served as Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, amid the fallout from the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry last fall after he stepped down following his appearance as a witness in the probe.  “I believe the recent media focus on my work as U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute,” said Volker, who was involved in the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Ukraine. The McCain Institute could not be reached for comment.  Green’s exit from the agency, which has been at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to divert Middle East aid to religious minorities in the region, comes weeks after he announced a $37 million commitment to 25 countries that have been affected by COVID-19, which reached pandemic levels this week and has topped 1,000 confirmed cases inside the United States.  Earlier Friday, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up to $50 billion to fight the rapidly spreading virus by boosting containment efforts and the availability of test kits.

"Suspended schedules. Darkened stages. Empty arenas. As the worsening spread of the coronavirus has forced shot callers in sports, entertainment and politics to nix games, parades, conventions, campaign pit stops and gatherings of almost every sort and size, Donald Trump over these past few dizzying days essentially and begrudgingly has made the same decision—even if he hasn’t made an official announcement. After holding more than 300 rallies during the 2016 campaign and nearly 100 more since he was elected—after going last month to Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada and South Carolina to “troll” Democrats in the runups to the primaries—the president was not in Michigan, Missouri or Mississippi this past week, and he won’t be in Ohio or Illinois or Florida or Arizona ahead of Tuesday’s votes. He has canceled events in Las Vegas, Denver and Milwaukee. And for the first time in a long, long time, Trump has on his typically merry-go-round docket of rallies … nothing. All of a sudden, we live in a world without crowds. And for Trump, it’s an existential threat—as much a threat as a sinking economy or the virus itself. Because Trump doesn’t just love crowds. He needs them. He needs crowds because of their political utility. Needs them to mine “data gold.” Needs them to be rolling, roiling, visceral focus groups—listening to the ebbs and flows of their roars, serving them what they want, scrapping what they don’t, stoking support with a skilled evangelist’s call and response. He is, after all, at his best and most effective riffing to the rank and file as opposed to monotonously reciting from a teleprompter all alone in the solemnity of the Oval Office. And he needs crowds, too, and perhaps most importantly, on account of psychological necessity. “They are his lifeline,” Bandy Lee, a Yale University psychiatrist and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, told me this week. “He’s very good at this,” she said, referring to the catalog of his performances at his rallies, “because his life depends on it, not just the life of his presidency but the life of his psyche.” In the estimation of Lee and other experts of her ilk, as well as the many people who have known him and worked with him for years, the way Trump is ties back to the way he was raised. The “complete emptiness inside,” the “bottomless void” that “can never be filled,” the “psychological defects” and “pathologically narcissistic traits”—all of this, says Lee, is a result of the core particulars of Trump’s upbringing: his distant and demanding father, the disruptive near-death experience of his mother when he was just a toddler, his banishment to military school when he was barely a teenager. “The lack of love translates into desiring accolades,” Lee explained. “And the rallies are really the most critical crutches that he’s had. He needs his followers more than his followers need him.” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair calls “a live audience” his “oxygen machine.” “The crowds,” former Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell told me the other day, “get him through the night.” And it’s always been like this. Starting in the 1970s and ‘80s, the foundationally lonely Trump cultivated transactional relationships with reporters and gossip columnists, in the same manner as his mentor, Roy Cohn. At times, he used a fake name to do his own PR. He decorated the walls of his office with magazine covers bearing images of his own face. In Atlantic City, at his casinos, he jaunted across gaming floors, feasting on the clamor of the throngs. “They cheered him,” recalled Alan Marcus, a former Trump publicist. “In front of a big crowd, and a big crowd could’ve been 25 people or 25,000 people, he can shine. Because he’s got that Trump persona. The Trump persona takes over the room.” By the middle of the aughts, when the success of “The Apprentice” erased the stain of his personal failures and business busts of the ’90s, he obsessed about the reality show’s ratings. “Ratings,” said Marcus, “are crowds.” And Trump’s political ascent? Implausible to the point of impossible without crowds. In the couple years before 2015, on the precampaign campaign trail, at off-year cattle calls of would-be candidates, Trump tested out talking points. “He would put forth his position or his feelings, and he would judge the level of response,” the late political strategist Pat Caddell once told me. He monitored not internal polling but Twitter mentions and tallies of retweets. He gauged what sizzled on conservative talk radio so he could channel it back. At his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower, when he glided down the escalator to say that he was running, the crowd was so important he paid some people to be there. The next month, he drew approximately 4,000 people to a rally in Phoenix. A month after that, the crowd was roughly five times that size in Mobile, Alabama, where he had his plane circle the stadium to a standing ovation and the wild-eyed appeal of his candidacy became hard to ignore. “Trump’s campaign,” Roger Stone would write, “was centered around a ‘set piece rally.’” At one of them, in New Hampshire, he told the people he had lots of friends, and rich friends, but who no longer would be his friends if and when he got elected. “You know who my friends are?” he said. “You’re my friends.” The crowd. Their cheers. And ever since, all the way up to his last rally, in Charlotte, on the second night of this month, Trump has engaged in an almost hypnotic version of the same, over and over again, using every one of his signature events to draw red-capped crowds, and to talk about the size of the crowds—whether or not, of course, the specifics are true—seldom missing a chance to employ the crowds and their counts as an ongoing contrast to cudgel his Democratic opponents. “An integral, main part of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman has said. “The driving force,” according to the campaign’s COO. But as America shuts down, as Broadway goes dark and Disney World goes dormant and March Madness goes poof, Trump at the moment has been stripped of arguably his most potent political strength. Entering a new, utterly altered reality, mere weeks after he traveled to India to revel in the adoration of a crowd of 110,000, Trump sat in the White House at a desk called Resolute and appeared out of his element and underprepared—while Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in the general election, stood the next afternoon in front of a bank of American flags in a hotel in Delaware and spoke to mostly just clicking cameras and seemed not frail or poorly supported but serious and up to the task. Biden’s (small) crowds and Trump’s (large) crowds hardly matter because now there are no crowds at all. “Rallies are important to the Trump campaign, and I’d worry about losing them,” former Trump aide Michael Caputo said, “because it would tilt a bit to Biden’s advantage.” Another former Trump aide pushed back on the premise. “It’s very early in the presidential cycle,” Sam Nunberg told me. “He’s still going to be able to hold rallies eventually, calling the guy ‘Sleepy Joe’ and making fun of him … one way or the other.” Nunberg stressed that Trump still has television and Twitter, platforms on which he has an irrefutable record of mastery of a certain sort, and that his flush campaign is a Facebook juggernaut, too, and that he always has possessed a blithe capacity for surviving crises and skirting consequence. All valid points. He made a prediction. “Trump will end up doing rallies,” Nunberg said. “Pandemic or not, Trump will end up doing rallies.” “What are your plans, Mr. President,” a reporter asked him on Thursday, “about campaign rallies?” “I think the Democrats won’t be having rallies, but nobody shows up to their rallies, anyway,” Trump said. “So, what difference does it make?” “But what about you, sir?” “My rallies are very big,” he said. “On the rallies, we’ll make that decision,” he continued. “But at this moment, we don’t have …” He stopped himself—as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to say it out loud. “I was going to Las Vegas. … I was going to Colorado …” He fantasized about a rally in Tampa on March 25 that reportedly was being planned but had not been publicly announced. That didn’t prevent him from dropping highly dubious details. “All sold out,” Trump said. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do.” No more rallies. No more crowds. “It’s like, if Don Rickles performed to a room of three people, would he have been funny? You know, insult comics, they need the energy of the discomfort they create for the jokes to work, for the act to work,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me this week. “It’s very bad for Trump to not have crowds. And I think he knows it.”",What Is Trump Without His Crowds?,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-crowds-129048,politico
"OTTAWA — Over five extraordinary hours on Friday, Canada’s federal government suspended Parliament, delayed its federal budget, imposed new restrictions on international travel and promised a major fiscal stimulus package, while the Bank of Canada slashed interest rates as the country collectively braces for the impact of coronavirus. The announcements rolled out, one after another, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained in isolation at his home in Ottawa, dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic that has turned personal — his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday, though her symptoms are mild. Trudeau has no symptoms of the virus, which has so far infected 157 people in Canada and caused one death. Speaking from outside his home at Rideau Cottage, Trudeau assured Canadians the government will take any measures necessary to slow the spread of the disease and to cushion them against its economic impacts. “We do not want any Canadians to have to worry about whether or not they’re going to be able to pay their rent,” he said. “We need to make sure that Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best public health advice and keep themselves safe.” Friday’s announcements mark a dramatic escalation in the government’s response since the World Health Organization labeled the coronavirus a pandemic two days ago, and a stark change in tone — on Thursday evening, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was still saying the budget would be tabled on March 30, as planned. But on Friday morning at 10 a.m., all five of Canada’s major political parties agreed to a motion to adjourn the House of Commons until April 20, in response to the spread of Covid-19. The suspension could be extended if necessary. Parliament has also passed spending-related bills that will allow the government to keep cash flowing while the House of Commons and Senate aren’t sitting. “We will face this together, and we will get through this together,” Government House Leader Pablo Rodríguez told reporters. The parties have agreed to a process to allow Parliament to be recalled over the coming weeks, if needed, with a skeleton crew of members present — likely those who live within driving distance. Before Parliament shut down, MPs and senators rushed to pass the USMCA, which received royal assent on Friday afternoon, making Canada the last country to endorse the new North American free trade pact. A few procedural steps remain before Canada formally ratifies the deal, and it will be several more months before it goes into force. President Donald Trump said Friday that Trudeau told him during a phone call the day before that Canada was on the cusp of approving the trade deal. The all-party motion on Friday also delayed the federal budget, previously scheduled for March 30. Morneau did not say when the budget might now be introduced, or whether that could happen before April 20. The budget, however, has suddenly become an afterthought as Morneau turns his attention to the far more urgent task of keeping the economy afloat. In an exceptional act of coordination Friday, Morneau held a rare joint press conference with Stephen Poloz, governor of the politically independent Bank of Canada, to introduce emergency measures in an attempt to buttress the economy before it suffers significant damage. Poloz made the biggest splash by introducing an unscheduled interest rate cut of half a percentage point — his second 50-basis-point reduction in nine days — to cushion the economy from the effects of coronavirus and battered crude prices. The governor left the door open to do more, if necessary. Morneau also provided a boost of C$10 billion in available credit for businesses through two business development agencies. Jeremy Rudin, the superintendent of financial institutions, joined them to announce changes that will effectively add more than C$300 billion in lending capacity for major banks. Morneau promised that more help is on the way. Ottawa will unveil a ""significant"" fiscal stimulus package next week, he said, including direct support for individuals. The new measures will come on top of a C$1 billion support package the government unveiled on Wednesday, which included money for provincial health care systems. The finance minister said another volley of economic support could come out of a phone call scheduled for Monday between Trudeau and his fellow G-7 leaders. He added the G-7 is looking for a coordinated approach. Ottawa is also taking new steps to limit the spread of Covid-19 to Canada from beyond its borders. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said international flights arriving in Canada will be restricted to a smaller number of airports to allow for screening of all passengers. The list of airports has not yet been released. Garneau also said all cruise ships carrying more than 500 people, including crew, will not be allowed to dock in Canada before July 1. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Canadians should postpone or cancel international travel, and should practice social distancing, including by avoiding crowded places, waving or touching elbows instead of shaking hands and staying two meters away from other people. She warned that anyone who travels internationally will be subject to any new rules suddenly imposed in those countries. “Your one-week trip may become much longer,” she said. However, as of yet there seems to be little discussion of any possible closures along the Canada-U.S. border. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said conversations with U.S. counterparts on Thursday highlighted “how important that border is for both of our countries,” while Trump told reporters the border had not come up during his conversation with Trudeau. “I think what we have to remember is that viruses don't know borders,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu said. “A border is not going to contain the virus.” The new measures come less than 24 hours after Trudeau’s wife tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a trip to the U.K. and exhibiting mild, flu-like symptoms. Grégoire Trudeau is currently in quarantine, and the prime minister and their three children will remain in isolation for 14 days. Trudeau has no symptoms and therefore has not been tested for the virus. Other parliamentarians, including International Trade Minister Mary Ng and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, are also in self-isolation after experiencing symptoms, though they have not been diagnosed with the virus. Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan had also shown symptoms, but tested negative for coronavirus on Friday. The federal government’s new approach to the coronavirus comes in the wake of tighter restrictions imposed by a number of provinces during the past 48 hours. All four of Canada’s largest provinces have now recommended canceling events with more than 250 people or have banned them outright, and Quebec and Ontario have both closed schools for at least two weeks. Trudeau spoke with provincial and territorial premiers on Friday afternoon, but at least one premier has already made clear he believes Ottawa isn’t doing enough. In a news conference before the call, Quebec Premier François Legault called on Trudeau to ""rapidly limit the entry of visitors to Canada."" On Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the announcements came in a rush, landing in a city that has only seen a few cases of the virus so far, and where there’s a sense that the storm must be coming but somehow isn’t quite real. Just before noon, ministers and public health officials clustered together on a stage in the National Press Theatre, telling Canadians to stand two meters apart and not to gather in large groups. A large group of journalists faced them, sitting side-by-side, passing around a couple of microphones that got a quick wipe-down between each question. And then, a few hours later, everything was quiet on the Hill, except for the strange vestiges of business-as-usual that hadn’t yet ground to a halt. At 3 p.m., two small groups of tourists were being led through the galleries overlooking the empty House of Commons, one numbering just three people. They were among the last visitors to be allowed in, before the building closes to the public. Two floors below, the House of Commons cafeteria was shutting down for the day and staff were getting ready to leave. They didn’t know when they’d be back.

"President Donald Trump on Friday deflected blame for his administration’s lagging ability to test Americans for the coronavirus outbreak, insisting instead — without offering evidence — that fault lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama. “I don't take responsibility at all,” Trump said defiantly, pointing to an unspecified “set of circumstances” and “rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.”  The remarks from the president came in response to questions at a Friday press conference about the lack of widespread access to testing, an aspect of his administration's coronavirus response that has been the subject of widespread, steady criticism. Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea is testing each day.  And Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that “the system is not really geared to what we need right now” in and called the testing system “a failing.”  But Trump, who spent weeks downplaying coronavirus before declaring it a national emergency on Friday, argued that the health care system was not designed for an outbreak on the scale of coronavirus, “with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.”  The president kept his criticism lighter and more forward-looking at first, declaring that his administration is “leaving a very indelible print in the future in case something like this happens again.”  “That's not the fault of anybody — and frankly the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers but not for these kind of numbers,” he added. But then Fauci stepped up to the mic to clarify his position, arguing that the CDC’s testing system, “for what it was designed for, it worked very well,” and maintaining that an “embrace” of the private sector was necessary for testing at the kind of scale needed for the fast-spreading coronavirus.  Then, Trump began pointing fingers.  “If you go back — please, if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. they didn't do testing like this,” he interjected, referencing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that sickened more than 60 million people between April 2009 and 2010. Trump asserted that the Obama administration “didn’t do testing” and that when “they started thinking about testing,” it was “far too late.” He reiterated a claim made on Twitter earlier in the day, calling the Obama administration’s response to the swine flu outbreak “a very big failure,” though the H1N1's fatality rate of .02 percent is much lower than the lowest fatality estimates for the coronavirus thus far.  Trump later got testy with another reporter who pressed him on whether he bore any responsibility for the surge in cases, noting that he’d disbanded the White House’s pandemic office. Trump told the reporter, PBS NewsHour's Yamiche Alcindor — with whom he's butted heads with in the past — that her inquiry was a “nasty question.”  After noting that his administration had quickly acted to restrict travel from China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, the president said he personally was not responsible for dissolving the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which had been part of the National Security Council until his administration disbanded it and rolled its officials into another office. “And when you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people. I could ask — perhaps in my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.” Trump said. “You say we did that. I don't know anything about it.” He continued: “I don't know, CDC, perhaps they do that — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.” Trump then began to move on, before returning to defend his administration’s response.  “We are doing a great job,” he insisted, referencing the health officials and business executives gathered behind him. “Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great incredible doctors and business people — the best in the world — and I can say that whether it's retailers or labs or anything you want to say. These are the best in the world.”  He also pointed to the number of fatalities in the U.S. attributed to the virus, which has hit 40 in the several weeks since the first reported case in the U.S., and is significantly lower than other countries hit hardest by the disease.  “Compare that with other countries that are many, many times that amount,” Trump said. “One of the reasons we have 40 and others have and, again, that number is going up just so you understand.” Trump’s criticism of the Obama administration on Friday wasn’t limited to its response to its own pandemic. At another point in the press conference, Trump appeared to work in a shot at healthcare.gov, the website created by the Obama administration for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges that was infamously marred by connectivity issues almost instantly when it debuted. Announcing that Google had offered to assist the White House in the creation of a website to better help Americans determine whether they needed to be tested for coronavirus and where to get tested if so, Trump quipped that the tech “is helping to develop a website that will be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.”",'I don't take responsibility at all': Trump deflects blame for coronavirus testing fumble ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-coronavirus-testing-128971,politico

"President Donald Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus aims to jump-start a lagging federal response by expanding testing, giving hospitals more capacity to deal with a potential flood of new patients and expanding telehealth, so patients in hot spots can be treated virtually. It reflected a growing acknowledgment of the scope of the public health crisis, with Trump himself saying at a Rose Garden rollout of the plan that he will ""most likely"" get tested, without committing to share the results. At the same time, Trump rejected blame for any shortcomings in a testing system that critics say has contributed to community spread of the respiratory disease, saying “I don’t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” The various policy moves left many questions unanswered, among them whether a website Trump said Google is developing to screen and test patients could compromise their privacy. Here are some key features: The president said the administration is working with pharmacies and other retailers to make drive-thru testing available ""at critical locations."" And he announced a series of partnerships with private labs to boost testing capacity just one day after top federal infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told House lawmakers that the federal government’s current testing system had been a “failing.” The president said there would be another 1.4 million tests available by next week and 5 million within the months, adding, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.” Public health experts would disagree: Multiple tests are often used on one person, and while federal officials have been hesitant to project case numbers, Fauci himself warned lawmakers that a complacent mitigation response could boost case numbers to the “many, many millions.” Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that 11,000 Americans had been tested. The FDA approved the first high-volume coronavirus test today. The president also appeared to oversell an effort by an affiliate of Google to help develop a website that will aid the administration’s efforts to screen and test for people with the virus. Trump suggested a sweeping effort, saying Google had 1,700 engineers working on the project and had made ""tremendous progress"" — and that the site will be able ""to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. ... We have many, many locations.""  But Verily, the life-sciences arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, later said in a statement that the website is in ""the early stages of development"" and would be initially tested in the Bay Area, ""with the hope of expanding more broadly over time."" Vice President Mike Pence said the administration by Sunday evening will ""be able to give specific guidance"" on when the website will be available.  The announcement instantly raised red flags for patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Trump outlined emergency measures hospitals can take under the declaration, most of which would free up beds for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. “Critical access” hospitals that are limited to 25 beds and get higher Medicare rates can boost their capacity and extend patient stays now limited to 96 hours. The order lifts rules for where hospitals can treat patients within their facilities and lets them add doctors as needed. The hospital industry supports these steps and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to release more detailed guidance later Friday that could expand on Trump’s list. The declaration lets HHS Secretary Alex Azar waive certain laws to expand the use of telehealth, which public health experts say can help reduce risk of transmission. The new order appears to let Azar waive federal licensing requirements so out-of-state doctors can treat patients virtually in states with the greatest need. The $8.3 billion coronavirus emergency funding package Trump signed last week also allows Azar to waive restrictions on Medicare payment for telehealth, as Congress has typically done for past emergencies. Telehealth groups and lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the committee overseeing Medicare, have encouraged Azar to activate that authority. Trump in his Rose Garden remarks called telehealth a “fairly new and incredible thing,"" though health care providers have used the technology for over a decade.

"Even as he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, President Donald Trump couldn't help but shake hands. “I want to encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we have issued by CDC and these common sense measures,” Trump told reporters at a Rose Garden press conference with top health officials and healthcare, retail and pharmacy CEOs. “A lot of it is common sense.”  The CDC’s website says to “avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places — elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people.” But as Trump introduced CEOs and members of his coronavirus taskforce, he couldn’t resist extending his hand.  First, he grabbed the mic and adjusted it for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.  He later reached out to Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, who looked down at the president’s hand before grabbing it to shake.  Trump shook hands with three others before Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president of the LHC Group, put a stop to the hand shaking. Greenstein instead offered an elbow bump to the president.  “I like that,” Trump said, after elbow-bumping. “That’s good.”  Trump, who indicated Friday that he had not been tested but ""most likely"" would be, has been exposed to people with the illness. While Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has disputed a media report that he initially tested positive for the virus less than a week after meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his press secretary, who took photos with Trump, tested positive for coronavirus this week.  Aside from his meeting with Bolsonaro in Florida, Trump has also been exposed to multiple Republican lawmakers who have self-quarantined after their own exposure to someone who tested positive for coronavirus at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump said he had not experienced any symptoms of the disease, but was consulting with his doctors on whether, and when, to get tested.  ""I think I will do it anyway,"" the president said, though he did not commit to sharing the results of a possible test. ""We are working out a schedule.""",Trump can't resist handshakes as he declares a coronavirus national emergency,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-cant-resist-handshakes-as-he-declares-a-coronavirus-national-emergency-128950,politico
"The full bench of the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to weigh in on two legal fights critical to President Donald Trump: whether the House can use the courts to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, and whether the House can sue to block Trump's effort to fund border wall construction over Congressional objections. The Friday afternoon announcement wiped out a major victory Trump scored last month when a smaller panel of the same court ruled, 2-1, that the courts should not wade into subpoena fights between Congress and the White House. The appeals court said it will hear arguments, en banc, April 28 in both the McGahn and border wall disputes. There seems to be little chance that the Supreme Court will resolve the issues definitively before the November election, but rulings in the House's favor could lead the justices to intervene with a stay in the coming months. Prospects for Trump prevailing in the cases at the D.C. Circuit look grim. While the active bench of that court leans toward Democratic appointees by a 7-4 margin, the order Friday indicated that both of Trump's nominees--Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao--have recused themselves from both cases.  As a result, the en banc court for McGahn will have only two Republican appointees. One additional GOP appointee, Judge David Sentelle, will join the en banc court considering the border wall funding dispute, the order said. The renewed debate at the D.C. Circuit over critical separation-of-powers issues is set to play out about a month after the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a trio of cases involving demands for access to Trump's personal financial records.  Two of those cases involve subpoenas from House committees. The third was triggered by a subpoena that a local grand jury in New York City issued for Trump's tax and business records. A decision from the Supreme Court in those cases is expected by the end of June. The majority opinion the D.C. Circuit issued last month in the McGahn case said the courts should butt out of subpoena fights between Congress and the executive branch because intervening would effectively shut down the usual process of negotiation between the branches and instead send both sides running to court.  Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also said blessing the subpoena was likely to trigger endless eddies of litigation over individual questions lawmakers wanted to ask McGahn in connection with their investigation into alleged efforts by Trump to obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. However, House lawyers pleaded with the full D.C. Circuit to rehear the case, arguing that bowing out of such fights actually amounts to siding with the White House, since it typically has considerable leverage over testimony and records lawmakers want. House Counsel Douglas Letter also warned that trying to foreclose subpoena litigation could lead to more unpleasant conflicts, like efforts by the House to arrest uncooperative witnesses. The Justice Department contended that McGahn, as a close presidential adviser, was absolutely immune from subpoena. Griffith didn't endorse that position. Judge Karen Henderson, who was on the panel and will be the only other GOP appointee on the en banc court, rejected the absolute immunity argument, but concurred with Griffith that courts shouldn't referee such fights. The only dissenter last month was Judge Judith Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. She said the court was gutting the House's impeachment powers by refusing to enforce the subpoena. The other appeal stems from the House's unsuccessful effort to challenge the plan Trump' announced in 2019 to use over $6 billion from military construction and counterdrug budgets to fund border wall construction even though Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for barrier projects and put strict limits on that money. The move, backed in part by a presidential emergency declaration, spurred a flurry of lawsuits from environmental and human rights groups, states, border residents, and the House itself. All said Trump's actions violated the power of the purse granted to Congress by the Constitution. The House's lawsuit, filed in Washington, found no traction. Last June, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden tossed it out, finding that Congress had no standing to sue Trump administration officials over allegedly unauthorized spending.  The House appealed that ruling, setting in motion arguments that took place before a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel last month and now scheduled to be reprised before the larger, 10-judge court in April.  No decision was rendered by the three-judge panel before Friday's order taking the border wall case en banc. The order said the issue of the House's standing is ""common"" to that case and the dispute over McGahn's testimony. Other suits aimed at blocking Trump's unusual border wall funding plan found greater purchase in the federal courts. Groups suing in California managed to get an injunction against construction, as did by El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights in a suit brought in Texas. However, those victories proved to be short lived, as the Supreme Court blocked the injunction out of California and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the one in Texas. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.","Full appeals court to hear McGahn, border wall cases",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/appeals-court-don-mcgahn-border-wall-cases-128914,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders acknowledged Friday that the novel coronavirus public health crisis had ""radically"" altered the nature of his White House bid ahead a slate of crucial primaries. The remarks from the Vermont senator came after a roughly 15-minute speech he delivered from his hometown of Burlington, where he discussed the “lessons” Americans could learn from the coronavirus and argued that its rapid spread demonstrated the need for his “Medicare for All” policy proposal. But following his brief address, Sanders was pressed by reporters on what the brutal political realities of the pandemic meant for his campaign. “That’s why I’m here today,” he said with a wink and a smile, before turning somber. “You’re right, it has significantly impacted our campaign, as all of you know,” Sanders said, describing his “love” for the massive rallies and more intimate town hall meetings his campaign has begun canceling in the wake of the burgeoning outbreak.  “That is changing, as you’ve indicated correctly,” he said. “Our staff is now, by and large, working at home. So it has radically changed our campaign.”  Leading up to the next four nominating contests Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, Sanders indicated that he would be relying increasingly on the various digital resources of his campaign apparatus in his primary battle against former Vice President Joe Biden.  “What I think we have going for us — which we have always had going for us, but we’re going to have to utilize even more — is our internet capabilities,” Sanders said. He cited his “many, many, many millions” of followers on Twitter and other online platforms, as well as his campaign’s ability to livestream events like his speech Thursday.  “We are in the process of thinking this through,” he added. “But this coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. And that’s hurting.” Sanders was also asked about his goals moving forward in the primary campaign, and whether the worsening coronavirus threat had forced him to rethink his role in the race given the calls he has already faced from some senior Democrats to concede the nomination to Biden. “Well my long-term goal is to win. The short-term goal is to figure out how we deal with the issues that you guys are appropriately raising,” Sanders replied, conceding that “under normal circumstances, I would not be in Burlington today.”  “I would be probably in Ohio, Florida or another state where a primary is coming up. But we can’t do — we’ve decided not to do under the advice of public health officials, not to do rallies, and that’s the right decision,” he continued. “So we are figuring out a way as to how we can best communicate with people, which will certainly be in a very strong way utilizing our social media capabilities.”",Sanders: Coronavirus has 'radically changed our campaign',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-campaign-coronavirus-128767,politico
"Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both acknowledged discussing potential aid from Washington to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, amid a crisis in air travel unlike anything the industry has seen since Sept. 11, 2001. Delta also announced it is cutting 40 percent of its flight capacity, the steepest in its history. The news comes two days after President Donald Trump announced a monthlong halt to U.S.-bound passengers from most of Europe, a stoppage that in one blow decimated many of the industry’s most lucrative international routes. “We are in discussions with the White House and Congress regarding the support they can provide to help us through this period,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees obtained by POLITICO. ""I’m optimistic we will receive their support."" A spokesperson for American Airlines also said Friday that the carrier was involved in early discussions with the government. Airlines have been struggling financially for weeks because of a steep slump in passenger demand as the global pandemic has spread. But Trump’s European travel restrictions pushed them even further into crisis. (Trump said Friday that he may expand the restrictions to include people coming from the United Kingdom.) ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we’ve seen,"" Bastian wrote, noting that bookings are net negative— meaning canceled bookings are more than new bookings — at Delta. ""We’re currently seeing more cancellations than new bookings over the next month,"" added. On Thursday, an administration official told POLITICO that ""Congress really will have little choice to act or face a significant extinction moment for the airline industry."" Trump's economic aides have been studying how the President George W. Bush administration propped up the airline industry after 9/11. Bastian warned in his memo, though, that the ""form and value"" of help from the government is unpredictable. ""We can’t put our company’s future at risk waiting on aid from our government.""

"President Donald Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump stayed home from work at the White House on Friday as a precaution after meeting with an Australian official who has coronavirus.  “The White House is aware that [Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton] tested positive for COVID-19. He was asymptomatic during the interaction,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. ""Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine. She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.” Last week Ivanka, Attorney General William Barr and Trump aides including Kellyanne Conway met with Dutton in Washington for a meeting about online child exploitation. In a statement released on Friday on Twitter, Dutton said he “woke up with a temperature and sore throat” and confirmed he has the coronavirus.  “I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for COVID-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive,” Dutton said in a statement.  In a photo posted on Twitter by the Australian Embassy in the U.S., Dutton is seen standing next to Ivanka and the other officials. Barr also stayed at home on Friday, according to Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec, who said he is “feeling great and not showing any symptoms” and has consulted with the CDC. “CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point,” Kupec said.  Ivanka and Barr are the latest people close to the president who have potentially been exposed to the virus and have stayed home as a precaution. Republicans close to the president -- Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Matt Getz of Florida, Rep. Doug Collins of Florida, and incoming Chief of Staff Mark Meadows – all self-quarantined after being exposed to a person with the virus at CPAC.   Trump was in contact last weekend with at least two people who have now tested positive for COVID-19 after a meeting with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro at his home and sanctuary in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago. One of Bolsonaro’s aides, communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, and the Mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, were both at Mar-a-Lago and said they have the virus, although they are reportedly doing well.   Despite the close encounters, the White House has not signaled that the president has been tested for the virus, which has now infected over 1,000 people in the United States and has spread to almost every corner of the world.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the lead experts on Trump’s coronavirus task force, said on MSNBC Friday that “yes,” someone who has been exposed to a person with the virus should isolate themselves and find a test, but would not speak directly about the president’s situation.  “You know, I leave that to the president’s physician,” Fauci said. “They have very good White House physician and physician staff there, so when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician.”",Ivanka Trump stayed home from White House after exposure to person with coronavirus ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/ivanka-trump-coronavirus-exposure-128721,politico
"At 73 years old, President Donald Trump is a prime target for a contagious disease that falls hard on the elderly. Multiple people in the Trump orbit are infected. Trump posed for a picture alongside an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who has tested positive. (Bolsonaro, who is in the same picture, denies reports that he’s positive.) The president spoke at the CPAC conference earlier this month where, as was later reported, an attendee carrying a gold-plated VIP ticket was later diagnosed as virus-positive. Other attendees of the conference, including incoming chief of staff Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), and Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) exercised medical caution with self-quarantine. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.),who was at Mar-a-Lago at the same time as the Brazilian visitors, is also self-quarantining. And both Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump recently spent time with an Australian minister who subsequently tested positive. It’s almost as if the virus has circled Trump. At this point, it’s not morbid, just good planning, to say the administration has no excuse not to start making plans for the chance that the virus might incapacitate Trump. The White House has not exactly been transparent about whether Trump has been tested. But his age and his clinical obesity mean that his system would be fighting an infection from a trench: It can put older patients on ventilators, sometimes for four weeks, even if they do recover. The Constitution has a provision for this, of course: The 25th Amendment allows an orderly transfer of power if the president can’t execute his duties. The obstacle to such a smooth transition isn’t the system: It’s Trump. Trump himself never admits weakness. As a businessman and a leader, he resists looking too far ahead, and is known for simply dodging and weaving to keep bad news at bay—a quality that has already served him badly in handling the biggest crisis of his presidency. As for the people around him: He hand-picks his staff for personal loyalty over any particular principles, and replaces them when they fail to exhibit the blind allegiance he desires. The 25th Amendment has been invoked only a few times, always voluntarily by presidents themselves when they’ve undergone surgery. If it’s hard to imagine Trump himself ceding power for any reason, it’s even harder to imagine the amendment’s powerful Section 4 being invoked, transferring power from the president without his consent. It requires consensus of the people close to him—specifically, “the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide.” The idea that Pence and the Trump Cabinet would automatically step in and unseat their boss should Trump contract the virus—and, say, be hospitalized without handing over the reins—cannot be assumed. Even if they did get together and agree to hand Pence control, it is Trump, and no one else, who has groomed and cultivated the political base that would likely flip out and scream “coup” the moment it happened. The 25th Amendment has already come up in Trump’s presidency. It received heavy review and inspection in the early semesters of Donald Trump’s term when top White House aides fretted that the chief executive might have only one oar in the water. Trump’s erratic, impulsive, unstable ways—his firing of FBI Director James B. Comey; his divulging of classified information to Russian diplomats in the Oval Office; his request for “loyalty” from Comey, in particular—reportedly prompted discussions about using the 1967 amendment to replace him with Vice President Mike Pence. But just because Trump, Pence and the Cabinet might not do the right thing doesn’t mean we shouldn’t secure a promise from them that an orderly transition of power is being sketched out should serious illness strike the president. To prevent a destabilizing vacancy in the most powerful office in the world, Trump must volunteer that he will use the 25th Amendment to turn over the powers of the presidency to Pence if he becomes seriously ill. Under the amendment, he can retrieve these powers by simply writing a letter expressing that he has regained sufficient health to serve as president. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used the amendment to temporarily delegate presidential powers during medical incidents during their terms. Trump must also encourage Pence to exercise a transition of power should he become gravely ill.  Invoking the 25th Amendment is nowhere near staging a coup, as Trump ultraloyalists might holler.

"President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to offset lagging coronavirus testing and unlock billions of dollars — accelerating a response plan that has faced weeks of criticism. Trump touted partnerships with private companies that he claimed would allow patients to learn if they need to be tested and locate a testing site, some of which will be drive-thru facilities at big box retailers across the country. “To unleash the full power of the federal government under this effort today, I'm officially declaring a national emergency,” he said at an announcement in the Rose Garden. “Two very big words.” Trump insisted the move would eradicate the testing shortcomings that health experts say hindered the country’s ability to contain the virus when it first appeared on American shores. In recent days, Trump’s health officials have warned Americans to expect the situation to worsen, spurring much of the country’s public spaces to shutter — professional sports have been suspended, concert halls are closed until further notice and many Americans have been asked to self-isolate. Yet even as Trump unleashed $50 billion in government funding, the announcement had a distinct market-first flavor. Trump outlined a series of agreements with private companies, including Google, Target and Walmart, to facilitate swifter coronavirus testing for Americans. Target and Walmart said they will set aside parking lot space for testing sites, while Google pledged to set up a website to determine whether a person needs a test, and where one is available. “Very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites,” said Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump put in charge of the administration’s coronavirus task force. Trump said he expected 1.4 million additional tests to be available next week and 5 million within a month — even as he cautioned against everyone rushing to get tested. “We don’t want everybody taking this test,” he said. “It’s totally unnecessary.” Trump has faced condemnation over the administration's failure to provide adequate testing and resources for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people worldwide and infected tens of thousands. Health specialists have also reprimanded Trump for repeatedly downplaying what has now been deemed a global pandemic. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said of the government’s struggles to produce enough tests, blaming existing rules set by prior administration for limiting his options. “We were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” And he claimed to not know that a pandemic preparedness team within the National Security Council was scrapped in 2018. Trump called a question about it “nasty” at a news conference.  “I didn’t do it,” he said. Still, Trump's executive actions on Friday received a positive response on Wall Street and even among Democrats. A faltering stock market swiftly rebounded as Trump was speaking, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring nearly 2,000 points, or more than 9 percent, the largest percentage gain since the 2008 crisis. The comeback reversed nearly all of Thursday’s tumble, which was the worst since the 1987 market crash. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y,), who had urged Trump to act more forcefully, offered rare praise for the president but warned him not to go too far. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” he said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) offered no comment. In addition to his executive actions, Trump has pressed Congress for an economic stimulus package that could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. Late Friday, Pelosi announced that she had clinched a deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a package meant to provide paid leave for workers, expand food aid and support widespread testing for the illness at no cost to patients. Only hours earlier, Trump had said during his press conference that he did not yet support the latest version of the bill.  “We just don't think they're giving enough,” he said. “We don't think the Democrats are giving enough.” Friday's national emergency declaration was considerably different than one the White House earlier this week had signaled was being prepared. A White House aide involved in the coronavirus response told POLITICO on Wednesday that Trump would sign a limited emergency declaration that only addressed the faltering economy by unleashing billions of dollars for loans to small businesses and to cover missed paychecks for hourly workers. But Democrats and many health care industry leaders were pressuring Trump to declare a more expansive emergency to help hard-hit states build mobile hospitals and shelters, while assisting with public safety and other issues.  White House documents referenced both the Stafford Act, which is designed to activate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Emergencies Act, the same law he invoked last year to repurpose government funds for construction of a southern border. But the president only said his order would increase the powers of the Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency thus far in the administration's coronavirus response. Under Friday's order, HHS will be able to waive certain Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program requirements in an effort to bypass time-consuming regulations. Separately, Trump said the federal government will waive interest on federal student loans and would purchase additional crude oil for the nation’s reserves. “This will pass,” he said. “This will pass through. We're going to be even stronger for it. We learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned.” Previously, Trump had been reluctant to declare a more sweeping national emergency, fearful of stoking panic with such a dramatic step. But his thinking evolved as the American coronavirus caseload soared past 1,600 this week, with public health officials warning the country to expect a spike in the coming days. For weeks, Trump has tried to reassure Americans that the widening outbreak is under control. But the situation has escalated in recent days. The stock market has dropped in record numbers not seen since the 2008 recession, and much of the country — from Disney World to professional sports leagues, museums and concert halls — has shut down. Across the U.S., the coronavirus has now killed more than 40 people and health officials have warned that the situation will worsen. Trump made another attempt to calm Wall Street during a brief prime-time Oval Office address on Wednesday. But he instead caused more confusion when he misrepresented the contours of a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from Europe and misstated that insurance companies had promised to fully pay for people’s coronavirus treatment. Friday's declaration builds on a previous, agency-specific ""public health emergency"" declaration HHS made in January. The move unlocked some initial federal money and resources. But Friday’s two designations are much broader. Still, some disaster management experts were disappointed that Trump on Friday did not appear to task FEMA — the agency that oversees hurricane, tornado and flood response — with leading the government’s coronavirus response plan. “FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis,” said Tim Manning, a former FEMA deputy administrator. “If there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved. I’m not sure how it could be done mechanically or legally without FEMA.” FEMA has previously helped with government responses to other insidious dangerous outbreaks, including SARS, MERS and Ebola. While previous presidents have made emergency declarations “virus threat” disasters — Bill Clinton did it for West Nile virus under the Stafford Act — it is rare, former FEMA officials say.",Trump declares national emergency in latest bid to combat coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/coronavirus-emergency-declaration-trump-128530,politico
"Asia’s richest man announced his intention on Friday to ship 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.  Jack Ma’s charitable foundation and his China-based company's foundation, the Alibaba Foundation, have also sourced and donated supplies to other countries being hit by the virus, including Japan, Korea, Italy, Iran and Spain.  The donation comes amid testing delays across the U.S. as state officials scramble amid a shortage of lab materials — sparking concerns that health officials are undercounting the number of Americans with the virus.  “Drawing from my own country’s experience, speedy and accurate testing and adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus,” the statement said. “We hope that our donation can help Americans fight against the pandemic!” Ma’s announcement also comes as Trump aides and allies cast blame on China, with some officials calling it “the Wuhan virus” — a reference to the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the disease. National security adviser Robert O’Brien has accused China of covering up a health crisis, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has labeled the outbreak the “Wuhan coronavirus.”  “The crisis presents a huge challenge to all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we face today can no longer be resolved by any individual country,” Ma said in the statement. “Rather, we need to combat the virus by working hand-in-hand. At this moment, we can’t beat this virus unless we eliminate boundaries to resources and share our know-how and hard-earned lessons.”","Chinese businessman to donate 500,000 test kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. ",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/jack-ma-coronavirus-test-kits-128522,politico
"Louisiana will postpone its presidential primary, which was originally scheduled for April 4, as part of the state government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The state is the first in the nation to postpone a primary since the outbreak of the virus. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the contest will be delayed until June 20.  “Safe and secure elections also mean safety to the people of Louisiana,” Ardoin said at a press conference. Several states are voting before Louisiana, including four holding primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. But officials in those states indicated that Election Day will go on as planned. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from Arizona Secretary of State Kathy Hobbs, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, Illinois Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose read. The Wyoming Democratic Party, which is holding its caucuses on April 4, also canceled the in-person portion of their upcoming vote. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Louisiana moving its primary could cause a major headache for the state for the Democratic National Convention. As written, the national party’s delegate selection rules mandate that states hold their nominating contests by June or face delegate penalties. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9th. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" State election officials around the country have been scrambling to make adjustments ahead of their primaries, including moving polling places away from locations concentrated with high-risk individuals, like nursing homes. The top election official in Arizona's Maricopa County, where just under 60 percent of the state's registered Democrats live, announced that his office would mail ballots to ""traditional Election Day voters"" eligible to vote in Tuesday's Democratic primary but who do not normally get absentee ballots mailed to them. Voters are encouraged to not mail the ballots back. Instead, officials say mailing out ballots before Election Day will allow voters to drop off already filled-out ballots in an effort to limit interactions and promote social distancing. Ohio, which is holding its primary on Tuesday, is moving nearly 150 polling places. Similar measures have been taken by some municipalities in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, which will also vote that day. “We’re seeing that this public health moment presents challenges for elections officials,” Kristen Clarke, the president & executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said. “And its having a cascading effect … By next week, on Tuesday, we’ll see coronavirus having an even broader impact on how elections are playing out.” Aaron M. Sellers, a spokesperson for the Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio, said he started receiving panicked calls over the weekend from directors of elder care facilities.  “They want to limit residents’ exposure to visitors because that’s such a vulnerable population,” he said in an interview with POLITICO.  The Centers for Disease Control recently issued guidance targeted to election officials that urges states and counties to encourage mail-in voting and early voting as much as possible, in an effort to “minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling stations.” The CDC also urged poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect polling stations, “limit nonessential visitors” and encourage as much social distancing as possible. Election administrators and party officials in most states have also been pushing voters to take advantage of early and mail voting, when possible. However, laws regulating voting in any other way other than in person, on Election Day, vary wildly by state. “Staffing [flexibility], more utilization of mail ballots, being concerned about infection, providing disinfectant, all of these things are ideas that supervisors of elections are trying to implement,” Ion Sancho, a former longtime supervisor of elections in Leon County, Fla., said. “And at the last second, this is not going to be simple. This is not going to be easy. But we're going to get through it.” But the last-minute changes present significant challenges as well. In Ohio, Sellers said his county was not able to find replacement polling sites on such short notice, and will instead consolidate with neighboring precincts.  “It’s incredibly difficult to find good locations that are ADA-compliant and have ample parking on such short notice, plus they have to want us to be there,” he said.  Election administrators are also grappling with another coronavirus-related challenge: a dependence on elderly poll workers. “We’re getting people calling us who are apprehensive, saying, ‘Hey I just don’t feel comfortable working the polls,’” Sellers said. “So we’re finding additional people to chip in.”",Louisiana postpones primary as states scramble to adjust to coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/louisiana-postpones-presidential-primary-due-to-coronavirus-128514,politico
"The leader of a libertarian-leaning tech group is stepping down as its president after tweeting that it would be “poetic justice” if President Donald Trump died from the coronavirus, the group confirmed Friday. Berin Szóka, president of Washington-based think tank TechFreedom, will be taking an indefinite sabbatical to write a book on tech policy, as first reported by POLITICO earlier Friday. Shane Tews, a longtime member of the group's board, will lead the organization in his stead.  The move deals a blow to one of the tech industry’s staunchest defenders in Washington, where Szóka has served as its combative and outspoken leader for nearly a decade. Szóka and TechFreedom, which receives funding from at least one tech giant, Google, have been relentless allies of Silicon Valley, particularly as it has faced calls for increased regulation in Washington in recent years. The group has opposed efforts to create more stringent rules for privacy and online speech, among other issues. But Szóka has also been a frequent critic of the president, delivering at times scathing rebukes of his actions on social media. The planned shake-up comes just four days after Szóka prompted a firestorm of criticism online by suggesting that the president succumbing to the virus would be fitting. “Serious question: could there possibly [sic] any greater poetic justice in the universe than for Trump to die of the #CPACvirus?” Szóka tweeted late Monday. Recent reports that an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference was later diagnosed with Covid-19 sparked fears that the president may have been exposed to the virus. Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had contact with the president as well before entering self-quarantine due to possible exposure. The Szóka tweet immediately drew condemnations online, racking up hundreds of negative replies within minutes and some calls for his resignation. Szóka later deleted the tweet, and has since issued an apology. “Earlier this week, I sent a thoughtless tweet making an inappropriate comment about the President that I deeply regret,” he tweeted Thursday. “I was wrong to tweet it and deleted it. Again, I apologize.”",Tech think tank chief to step down after Trump death tweet,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/think-tank-chief-to-step-down-after-trump-death-tweet-128397,politico
"In the early hours of Friday, U.S. and British aircraft conducted multiple airstrikes on the missile storage sites of the Iraqi militia group Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian group that was also hit by unclaimed airstrikes in Syria the day before. Until Wednesday, when a rocket attack killed two Americans and one British service member on a sprawling base north of Baghdad, there hadn’t been much noise from Tehran since its reprisal in early January after the U.S. killed Qassem Soleimani. This week’s attack, which was meticulously planned and clearly not the work of the ramshackle remnants of the Islamic State, changed that. A truck with two rows of rocket-launching tubes discreetly installed in the flatbed, approached the base undetected and fired the rockets in one sudden salvo.  As someone who has gotten lost while walking around the maze of concrete barriers that make up the 15-square-mile Camp Taji base, I can attest to the great accuracy of the strike. Taji is massive, and the strike hit at just the right moment and just the right spot, probably guided by a drone or human agent.  The next day, Kataib Hezbollah (KH), the Iraqi Shiite militia closest to Iran, praised the attack as an act of the pro-Iranian “resistance” against U.S. “occupation”, a surefire sign that pro-Iranian militias were behind the strike and the Shiite militia version of “humble bragging.” By that stage, either U.S. or Israeli aircraft had already struck back at KH and other Shiite militias, albeit just over the border in Syria late on Wednesday, killing around two dozen fighters and wounding many more. The strikes, and the subsequent round launched very early Friday morning, were reminiscent of the United States’ retaliatory attacks in late December on KH after the militia group caused the last U.S. death in Iraq in a rocket attack on December 27.  Friday morning’s strikes may not be the end in a new tit-for-tat cycle that has the potential to spark a wider conflict. Iran is escalating through its Iraqi militias because it wants to raise pressure to evict U.S. forces from Iraq and to threaten Iraqi leaders ahead of next week’s selection of a replacement for resigned Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Thursday: “You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” But how can deterrence be established quickly to end the cycle of attacks and prevent further loss of American lives? The deaths of two U.S. personnel—one military, one contractor—at Taji comes days after the March 8 deaths of two U.S. Marine special forces operators in a firefight with the Islamic State in northern Iraq. The two episodes underline the complexity of what the U.S. military is attempting to do in today’s Iraq. The mission of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR, or the coalition, for short) is still to defeat the last remnants of the Islamic State. In recent weeks, the coalition has ramped up its special forces raiding alongside Iraqi commandos, achieving significant successes against Islamic State leadership targets. When the U.S. gets on a roll, triggering new raids on the basis of data from laptops and phones recovered in each prior raid, terrorists face the most unrelenting foe in the world. But boosted effectiveness comes at a cost of added risk, as the March 8 deaths illustrate. To complicate matters, Iran-backed militias like KH are seeking to lever the U.S.-backed coalition out of Iraq by any means necessary, regardless of the coalition’s contribution to the anti-Islamic State struggle. Militias like KH sought the removal of international forces long before they killed an American on December 27, before they themselves were struck on December 29, and before their patriarchs, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia chieftain Aby Mahdi al-Muhandis, were killed by the U.S. on January 3 in a Baghdad drone strike. Now the militias are doubling their efforts, including issuing warnings to Iraqi officials and soldiers to distance themselves from the coalition (which they did not). In recent months, KH has threatened Iraqi MPs to vote to remove U.S. forces (enough of them resisted this call to prevent a vote with quorum) and threatened Iraq’s president Barham Salih if he met with President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum (he met Trump anyway).  Now KH is also issuing statements vetoing certain candidates for Iraq’s imminent selection of a new prime minister, suggesting which candidate should be picked (current premier Adel Abdal-Mahdi), and explicitly suggesting how the country’s most senior religious leaders should rule on the matter.  This is all unprecedented territory in Iraq, particularly the openness of the threats, similar to Iran’s recent elections where the regime blocked over 7,000 candidates for Parliament and invalidated a third of sitting MPs from seeking reelection.  The U.S. has clearly not yet deterred the militias from killing Americans and the result is that U.S. forces in Iraq are not being protected by either the Iraqi government or, ultimately, by our own government. This is not a sustainable situation. What can change? Last night’s strikes on KH missile and rocket bases were an attempt to take the high road, but the lack of large secondary explosions suggests that KH had evacuated its valuable weapons long before the strike. Iran’s militia proxies in Iraq can trade empty buildings or even two dozen of their own rank and file for three Anglo-American fatalities all day, every day. This a game we will lose. The right approach probably lies somewhere between the high and low roads, with very prompt, decisive and unclaimed attacks demonstrated against some senior Iraqi militia leaders in order to make others think very seriously about their personal future. But high-value leadership targets — which Iran and the militias do value — are generally not available to hit the day after Americans are killed: they are keeping their heads down. Congress and the administration need to sit privately and agree to some ground rules for the use of military force that allow the U.S. military to delink the timing of deterrent strikes, so that we can strike the right targets when they become available, to deter militia attacks that are highly likely to come otherwise. In parallel, the U.S. should toughen its mindset, quietly bringing the force protection assets into Iraq that it needs (i.e., Patriot missiles and anti-rocket close-in defenses) without further consultation with an Iraqi government that would rather adopt a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach.  And finally, the U.S. should let the militias keep over-reaching, keep showing their hand as would-be dictators under Iran’s control, while the U.S.-led coalition keeps helping Iraq to defeat the Islamic State. This is a game we can win.",How the U.S. Can Stop the Surge of Deadly Rocket Attacks in Iraq,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/iraq-airstrikes-shiite-militias-islamic-state-128210,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued Friday that the coronavirus pandemic presents ""a great investment opportunity,"" insisting that global markets spooked by the public health crisis will rebound eventually. ""This is a short-term issue. It may be a couple of months, but we're going to get through this, and the economy will be stronger than ever,"" Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. ""You know, I look back at people who bought stocks after the crash in 1987, people who bought stocks after the financial crisis,"" he continued. ""For long-term investors, this will be a great investment opportunity."" Despite the secretary's optimism, international anxiety over the coronavirus has provoked a historically negative reaction in recent days from Wall Street, alarmed at least in part by President Donald Trump's management of the mushrooming outbreak.  Following the president's prime-time address to the nation Wednesday evening, during which he announced a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from most of Europe, panicked investors triggered a marketwide trading halt for the second time this week and only the third time in history.  But Trump asserted Thursday that drastic measures to protect American lives justified any potential economic downturn and offered rosy predictions of a market recovery.  ""It's taken a big hit, but it's going to all bounce back, and it's going to bounce back very big at the right time,"" he told reporters at the White House. Mnuchin's remarks Friday echoed a similar assessment made last week by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who urged investors to capitalize on the faltering stock market amid coronavirus fears.

"The White House is holding up the nomination for one of the Pentagon’s top intelligence jobs because the official is not considered sufficiently loyal to the president, according to three current and former administration officials. Kathryn Wheelbarger, who has been serving as acting assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs since November 2018, would become the deputy undersecretary of Defense for intelligence if the nomination moves forward. But the holdup comes as President Donald Trump continues a post-impeachment loyalty purge that has already felled two senior Pentagon officials in recent weeks. The post that Wheelbarger would fill is one of 21 senior positions at the Pentagon that are empty or filled on a temporary basis, a record high for the Trump administration. Lawmakers have raised concerns in recent weeks that the department doesn't have enough qualified people in place to tackle the nation's biggest national security problems as it faces a host of crises, from the spread of the coronavirus to a new spike in tensions with Iran. The White House announced its intent to nominate Wheelbarger for the No. 2 position at the Pentagon overseeing military intelligence on Feb. 13, but it has not yet submitted her paperwork to the Senate, a spokesperson for the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed. By contrast, William Gillis, who the president announced would be nominated for assistant secretary of Defense for sustainment on the same day, had his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Wheelbarger, through a Pentagon spokesperson, referred comment to the White House, which declined to comment. In her current acting role, Wheelbarger has been the Pentagon’s point person on a host of issues, from the conflict in Syria to relations with NATO. On Tuesday, she testified alongside U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Frank McKenzie and U.S. Africa Command head Gen. Stephen Townsend on the U.S. peace agreement with Afghanistan, terrorist threats in West Africa and more. In particular, Wheelbarger has been “instrumental and a driving force behind the president’s efforts to seek 2 percent defense funding from NATO allies,” one administration official told POLITICO. “She hammered that message repeatedly.” But the White House is not satisfied that Wheelbarger is sufficiently loyal to the administration, the three current and former officials said. The people pointed to Wheelbarger’s two years spent working for the late Sen. John McCain, who feuded publicly with Trump before his death in 2019, as the root of the current tension. But the administration official said the White House is wrong about Wheelbarger, noting that she has worked for Trump for 50 percent longer than she did for McCain. Wheelbarger also declined to testify before Congress during the impeachment inquiry, the official said, explaining that she and her lawyer convinced congressional staff that she would not be able to provide additional information for the case. This is not the first time the White House has intervened on Pentagon personnel issues. The Trump administration demanded the ouster of John Rood, then-undersecretary of Defense for policy, in February, and has since rejected several of Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s choices to replace him. The White House personnel office, which is led by Trump loyalist John McEntee, put forth its own candidate to replace Rood: Elbridge Colby, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of Defense and is one of the primary authors of the National Defense Strategy. The White House also recently withdrew the nomination of Elaine McCusker to be Pentagon comptroller after emails emerged showing her questioning the administration’s suspension of military aid to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of the impeachment. “Unless you are here to support him personally, he’d rather have gaps,” said one former administration official.",White House holding up DoD nomination amid Trump loyalty purge,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/defense-nomination-trump-loyalty-128244,politico

"President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would eliminate the interest on federal student loans ""until further notice"" as part of a package of emergency executive actions designed to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. “To help our students and their families, I’ve waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies and that will be until further notice,” Trump said during a Rose Garden address where he declared a national emergency. “That’s a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed.” The unprecedented move will provide relief to the more than 42 million Americans who owe more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding federal student loans. But it did not go as far as what some Democrats had proposed, which was a suspension of monthly loan payments or loan forgiveness. The department was considering instructing loan servicers to lower the interest rate on federal loans to zero percent, according to individuals familiar with the plan. Under that approach, a borrower's monthly payment amount would not automatically change, though any payments the borrower did make would likely pay down a greater share of the principal balance. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ""is proud to work with the President in taking decisive action to help students and parents during this national emergency,"" department spokesperson Liz Hill said in a statement. The new policy will be implemented by the Education Department, which was scrambling on Friday to issue instructions and guidance to the companies it hires to manage the monthly payments of borrowers. A department official said that the interest waiver would be automatically applied to all borrowers, effective Friday, even though it may take some another week to fully ""operationalize"" the policy. It's not clear how much money the interest waiver will save borrowers, but it could be billions of dollars, depending on how long the Trump administration keeps the policy in place. In fiscal 2019 alone, the Education Department reported that it charged more than $100 billion in interest on all federal student loans. Federal student loans already offer options for borrowers to defer payments under certain circumstances, including an economic hardship, though interest can continue to accrue. Trump's suspension of interest payments, combined with those existing benefits, could mean that some Americans would be able to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who have long pushed for sweeping student debt relief from the federal government have said in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the need to provide assistance to Americans struggling with monthly loan payments. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a tweet that Trump's action was ""not enough"" to help student loan borrowers. ""Donald Trump & @BetsyDeVosED need to cancel student loans, not just waive interest or suspend payments,"" she said. ""Suspending payments or interest just delays the pain."" However, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) tweeted that it was a ""good step"" and that ""With so much uncertainty in the economy, we need to continue to look at every available means of providing relief."" Senate Democrats earlier this week included a six-month moratorium on some federal student loan payments on their list of items they’d like to see in an economic rescue legislative package. The National Consumer Law Center, which represents low-income student loan borrowers, has also called for a moratorium on student loan payments. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that pausing student loan payments was among the ""list of 50 different items"" that Trump's advisers planned to present to him to shore up the economy and financial markets due to the coronavirus pandemic. “That’ll be something we’re looking at,” Mnuchin said during an interivew on CNBC. “We have lots of authorities,” Mnuchin said, adding that on “things where we don’t have authorities, we’re going to work with both the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis. I can assure you the president is all about action, action, action.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has called for sweeping student loan forgiveness, tweeted earlier in the day that she was ""thankful"" that the Trump administration was ""taking pausing student loan payments seriously."" She called it ""a decisive move that will help stabilize millions of people. We should do it now. There is much more to be done, but every step counts."" The Education Department on Friday was still determining the mechanics of how to carry out Trump's announcement. The department has decided that the policy will automatically apply to all borrowers with federal direct loans, federally held Family Federal Education Loans and federally held Perkins Loans, according to a department official. Borrowers whose loans are in income-based repayment or in forbearance will still qualify. ""This will be operationalized over the next week or so, and it will be retroactive back to today,"" the official said. Borrowers could potentially seek a recalculation of their monthly payment under income-driven repayment plans or some would qualify for forbearance options, which would now be a way to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Much of the implementation will fall to the nine companies that the Education Department hires to collect and manage the payments of federal student loan borrowers. “Servicers and the Department have already begun discussions on how to implement this response to the current situation and we look forward to being able to provide more information to borrowers very shortly,” said Scott Buchanan, the president of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, the trade association that represents the companies. “Servicers will be updating websites in the coming days with information as soon as it becomes available.”",Trump to waive interest on federal student loans 'until further notice',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-administration-student-loan-payments-suspension-128181,politico
"The House passed sweeping legislation Saturday to respond to the coronavirus outbreak battering the nation, an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to expand access to free testing, provide $1 billion in food aid and extend sick leave benefits to vulnerable Americans. The bill's bipartisan passage, 363-40, was virtually assured when President Donald Trump backed the measure — largely hammered out by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and urged Republicans to support the bill. Trump's tweet, just before 9 p.m., capped several days of whiplash as Democrats and the White House appeared, at times, inches from a deal only to see it yanked away amid technical disputes and inconsistent signals from the president. Trump's backing, though, was essential to ensure support from congressional Republicans for the multi-billion dollar plan.  Democrats put the bill on the floor shortly after midnight under an expedited process and passed it in the early hours of Saturday morning, sending it to the Senate, which is expected to take it up as early as Monday.  The bill is the product of a painstaking effort by Pelosi to pass a measure with bipartisan support rather than a doomed Democrat-only bill that the Senate would have immediately spiked.  ""[W]e thought it would be important to show the American people, assure the American people, that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them,"" Pelosi said. ""So we thank our Republicans — those who will be supporting the bill. We appreciate the president joining us with his tweet."" Pelosi said the final bill came together slowly because of a laborious review process in the executive branch, which required approvals from multiple agencies and officials. Pelosi praised Mnuchin for his cooperation, and she acknowledged she never directly spoke with Trump about the bill. ""There was no need for that,"" she said. Alongside Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected House committees to be working through next week's recess on a new bill meant to address the economic damage wrought by coronavirus, which has devastated the airline, hospitality and entertainment industries. For now, though, Democrats said they were pleased to pass a bipartisan plan that they expect to pass overwhelmingly in the House and move through the Senate by Monday. ""I think this was a very good sign of bipartisanship and working together, that we can overcome this virus. We’ve done much bigger things before,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday night, minutes after the deal was announced.  On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted: ""Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!"" Trump's approval came after a hard-fought — and chaotic — day of negotiations, with Democrats and Republicans alike unsure whether the president was on board with the proposal. For several hours before Trump's tweet, talks had devolved into a state of confusion, with key officials on both sides directly contradicting each other on whether a deal exists. ""Because it was essential for us to have legislation pass the House by this weekend, it required intense and constant negotiations for what could have been an elusive agreement,"" Pelosi said in a letter to fellow Democrats after 10 p.m. on Friday, thanking them for their patience amid the frenetic back-and-forth with the administration. Pelosi had announced to her members shortly after 6 p.m. that she had reached a deal. But House Republicans — and even Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat — had said talks were still ongoing and a deal had not yet been reached. Key Republicans cautioned that there were still lingering issues related to a tax credit for paid family sick leave. McCarthy later confirmed that Republicans sought more flexibility for small business owners who would be forced to offer paid leave to affected workers.  Adding to the confusion, Mnuchin surprised even members of his own party by announcing on Fox Business that he had reached an agreement with Pelosi. The Treasury secretary had huddled with Trump just minutes before — a meeting that delayed his appearance on the network for so long that Mnuchin ran out of time to speak before the program ended. Trump eventually tweeted his support hours later, delivering long-awaited relief to hundreds of members and aides who had spent 48 hours in limbo awaiting any updates about the status of the funding package. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,"" Trump tweeted. ""I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"" One of the other major obstacles involved the president's personal demand for a payroll tax cut in this package. That idea has little support on Capitol Hill, and Democrats have already said it would be debated as part of future coronavirus crisis-related legislation at a later date. McCarthy, who met with Trump and Mnuchin multiple times in the last 24 hours, confirmed that Trump had sought the last-minute addition, and said Republicans would push for it in Congress's next tranche of economic relief, which could come later this month or in April. ""I believe this will not be the only one,"" McCarthy said, alluding to future aid packages related to the outbreak. ""This is something that the president wants, we would have liked to have that as well. I think that would have taken a little more time."" Mnuchin earlier in the talks had also expressed concerns that a tax credit to offset the cost of Democratic-proposed sick leave provisions wouldn't work as advertised.  During Trump's White House press conference to announce a national emergency declaration on Friday afternoon, the president complained, ""We don't think the Democrats are giving enough,"" even as Capitol Hill Republicans had been framing the differences as largely technical. Pelosi and Mnuchin then got on the phone again to try to finalize an agreement. The last remaining issues came down to how businesses can receive a tax credit for providing paid sick days and emergency leave for workers who are suffering from the coronavirus or helping take care of family members who contract the disease.  Pelosi and Mnuchin exchanged at least 20 phone calls on Thursday and Friday as they tried to hammer out a proposal that Trump could support.  Both Republicans and Democrats in the House insisted that they would not leave Washington until they could approve the massive package, which would work to both stem the outbreak by offering free testing and offering paid time off, while shoring up support systems for low-income workers, including school lunch meals and unemployment insurance. The legislation includes 14 paid sick days for employees, as well as three months of paid emergency leave throughout the coronavirus crisis. Employers will be reimbursed for some of these costs through tax credits. At GOP insistence, the emergency leave provision will expire in a year. And Republicans were able to insert language exempting smaller businesses from the requirements. The legislation helps provide free food for children whose schools are closed during the crisis, as well as other initiatives to make sure seniors and food banks get help as well. One of the biggest provisions involves free testing — which has been one of the major shortcomings in the U.S. response to the outbreak so far. ""This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,"" Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues announcing the agreement. ""To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge."" The House plans to go into recess for a week. That break, though, may be extended if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Hoyer, who sets the floor schedule, has said Democrats and Republicans are taking the situation day by day and consulting with medical experts and Capitol safety officials. The package comes amid a sense of deep unease on Capitol Hill with both the growing outbreak and the chaotic way that negotiations were led. Several House Democrats expressed complaints about the process, including Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who wrote on Twitter: ""We have ~46% of the House awaiting the @potus to tweet support before they’ll vote, and 100% of the House afforded an hour or so to read and consider one of the most important measures on which we’ll ever vote. It’s not how good governance should work, even during a pandemic."" Pelosi acknowledged that the negotiations were not ideal, suggesting that future legislation would be drafted and approved in a different fashion. ""As we proceed with further legislation, we will do so happily under a different timetable and continue to welcome any suggestions you have,"" Pelosi wrote in her Friday night letter to colleagues. The anxiety has also been compounded by the growing numbers of lawmakers and aides who are intentionally isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus. A staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) has tested positive for coronavirus, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced Friday morning that he would be extending his self quarantine until March 17 “out of an abundance of caution.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told POLITICO he is consulting with doctors on what he should do after news came out that a Spanish right wing politician, Santiago Abascal, he met with on March 2 tested positive for the coronavirus. He said he’s sure he shook Abscal’s hand but added he “feels fine.” He’s currently staying home and has canceled all events in his home state.  A spokesman for Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who also met with Abascal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Smith is doing.  More than 1,400 people in the U.S. have been infected, though many health experts fear that number is dramatically undercounted given the lack of availability of testing.

"The U.S. is shoring up its defenses in the Middle East after tit-for-tat attacks between the U.S. military and an Iran-backed Shia militia group stoked new tensions in the region this week, the top U.S. general in the region announced Friday. Following the Wednesday rocket attack on Camp Taji, Iraq, that killed U.S. and British service members and a retaliatory U.S. and British airstrike on five locations in Iraq on Thursday, the U.S. military will continue to operate two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Harry S. Truman, Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. This is the first period of extended dual U.S. carrier operations in the Middle East since 2012, he said. McKenzie stressed the symbolic significance of keeping two U.S. carriers in the region, noting that the vessel ""is a floating piece of American sovereignty."" ""We know the Iranians watch them very closely,"" he said. In addition, the U.S. is moving Patriot missile defense systems, which are designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles of the type used by Iran, into Iraq. They may be joined by more weapon systems for countering rockets, artillery and mortars, known as C-RAM, McKenzie said. C-RAM is designed to knock down lower-altitude weapons such as the 107mm Katyusha rockets fired at Camp Taji on Wednesday, but they ""are not a panacea,"" he cautioned. Roughly 90,000 U.S. forces are operating in the area overseen by U.S. Central Command, including the Middle East and Afghanistan, up from the 80,000 that were there before the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike in January. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that some of these troops had begun to head home after several months without a significant attack; it is not yet clear if this reduction will continue. McKenzie declined to directly blame Iran for the attack, but noted that Kataib Hezbollah, the Shia militia group that launched the rocket barrage on Wednesday, is ""closely linked"" to Tehran. Kataib Hezbollah has been involved in 12 rocket attacks against coalition forces in the last six months, including a December attack on Kirkuk that killed an American contractor and led to a series of escalations that brought Washington and Tehran to the brink of war. The U.S. and British airstrikes launched on Thursday successfully hit and destroyed all five targets, all of which were Kataib Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, McKenzie said, noting that he expects minimal collateral damage. ""We believe that this is going to have an effect on deterring future strikes of this nature,"" McKenzie said.

"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Who gets saved and who collapses?,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says, ‘Well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made health care an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico
"The National Education Association announced Saturday that it is backing Joe Biden for president, handing the Democratic frontrunner a prized endorsement ahead of Tuesday’s big-state primaries as he aims to wipe out his last remaining major opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Lily Eskelsen García, president of the 3 million-member teachers union, praised the former vice president as a “tireless advocate for public education"" who understands the nation’s “moral responsibility to provide a great neighborhood public school for every student in every ZIP code.” The NEA is the nation's largest labor union. “For the past two years, the #RedforEd movement has proven the power of the National Education Association and the collective voice of our members to advocate for stronger public schools and opportunity for all students,” Eskelsen García said in a statement. “Now, with so much at stake in this election, educators are determined to use their voice to propel Joe Biden to the White House.” The endorsement precedes Tuesday’s key primaries in Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Ohio. NEA has members in every congressional district, including battleground states. Biden and Sanders (I-Vt.) are set to debate Sunday night just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open if he makes a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. The union’s members traditionally serve as national convention delegates and they have a high voter turnout rate. In the last presidential election, 89 percent of registered NEA members voted, according to the union. NEA endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Sanders early in the 2016 Democratic primary, though the move roiled Sanders backers in the union ranks. This time, union leaders waited to see how candidates performed in early primaries. “I'm not going to bring a recommendation before we see who actually can deliver votes,” Eskelsen García told POLITICO in January. The union's move on Saturday follows a lengthy process that included a questionnaire, videotaped interviews and multiple presidential forums. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, also an educator and an NEA member, have built “broad support” among members, a news release said. In her statement, Eskelsen García also lauded Biden’s support for better pay for teachers and increasing funding for support staff and paraprofessionals. “And Biden will fire Betsy DeVos and replace her with an education secretary who comes from a public school classroom and believes that educators must have a seat at the table when crafting education policy,” she said. Last month, the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union announced that it would encourage its local and state affiliates to back or endorse the presidential bids of Biden, Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to blockTrump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico

"Georgia has delayed its presidential primary due to coronavirus. The primary, which was originally scheduled for March 24, will now be held on May 19. Georgia is the second state to delay its presidential primary. Louisiana rescheduled its April 4 primary to June 20 on Friday. The virus, which has infected more than 2,700 people across the United States, has prompted school closures, the cessation of professional sports and, in many places, a prohibition on large public gatherings.  “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement, originally issued to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices.  In-person early voting has also been halted. A statement from state Sen. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, indicated that in-person and absentee ballots that have already been cast in the presidential primary will count. However, election officials in four states that are voting on Tuesday — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — said on Friday their primaries will go on as scheduled. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from top election officials read. After Tuesday, only one other state or territory has a presidential primary scheduled for the month of March: Puerto Rico. But party officials in the state have also requested the primary be moved. A statement from the Puerto Rico Democratic Party said Chairman Charles Rodriguez requested that the territory’s legislature postpone its primary until April 26, with the potential for the primary to be held later if the virus is still not contained.  Some election watchdogs fret that delaying primaries is a step too far, expressing worry that moving primaries could effectively suppress voters’ rights. “We all agree that the safety and health of the public is paramount, but steps can, and must be taken to protect voters and poll workers while also ensuring that the democratic process marches ahead,” read a joint statement issued after Louisiana's decision from dozens of groups, including The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP. “Sudden changes to election times, locations, and more have been proven to create barriers to, and in some instances the denial of, citizens their right to vote.” Election administrators in the four states voting on Tuesday have been scrambling to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Polling sites in high-risk places like nursing homes have been moved, and officials are instructing poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect voting areas. Voters have also been strongly encouraged to take advantage of early and mail-in voting as much as possible. However, early, mail, and absentee voting laws vary widely state-by-state. Some states — like Washington, which voted earlier this week — allow for expansive mail voting, limiting the amount of disruption the outbreak can cause for an election. But others only allow absentee votes with a valid excuse and have limited (or no) early voting, adding a barrier for some voters that likely cannot be lifted without legislative action from state lawmakers or executives. Elected officials and activists have started pushing for states to have more expansive absentee and mail-in voting in later primary states and for the general election, as fears over the long term effects of the virus’ spread builds.

"President Donald Trump assured Americans on Wednesday the deadly coronavirus was on the brink of disappearing. Two days later, he admitted it wasn’t. In the span of 48 hours this week, from the moment markets plunged after a confusing and stiff Oval Office address to his national emergency declaration from the Rose Garden, Trump watched his own assessment of the viral outbreak transform in extraordinary fashion, forcing him into a course correction. The unprecedented shutdown of the world’s largest economy — a nation of 330 million people — will mark the most consequential stretch of Trump’s presidency and transform how Americans think about their government. For Trump himself, the journey appeared to represent a recognition that his earlier path threatened to engulf a nation he oversees with a spreading pandemic and diminish hope for reelection this fall. Trump’s do-over approach — he unlocked $50 billion in government funding on Friday to address the growing crisis and threw his support behind House Democrats’ aid package hours later — followed weeks of the president shrugging off the coronavirus threat and making statements about the availability of tests, the severity of the virus and the development of a COVID-19 vaccine that his own officials had to correct, sometimes within minutes of being made. During a visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump said the virus “will go away” and said his response was “really working out.” Instead, the forecast grew worse. State and local leaders, business executives and tens of millions of ordinary Americans leapfrogged their president — without waiting for White House guidance — to shut down public spaces, schools, offices and other gathering spaces and encourage millions of Americans to hunker down for a fast-spreading, invisible threat. Even as the stock market rebounded Friday in response to Trump’s release of emergency funding, the week ended with a mystery about whether America’s 73-year-old commander-in-chief, who has downplayed concerns about a virus that disproportionately impacts the elderly, could potentially be the world’s highest-ranking vector. During a rare appearance in the White House briefing room on Saturday, donning a “USA” ball cap, Trump said he was tested Friday night for COVID-19, and has started receiving temperature checks. The news came hours after a top Brazilian official at Mar-a-Lago last weekend — who dined with the president and many of his top aides — tested positive for the virus. (The White House physician said late Saturday that Trump’s test was negative.) The White House began administering temperature checks this weekend to “any individuals who are in close contact” with Trump or Pence, a spokesman said. This included members of the press corps who were stopped by a staff physician at the entrance to the James S. Brady briefing room Saturday afternoon. “SOCIAL DISTANCING!” Trump tweeted prior to the news conference and one day after he was seen repeatedly shaking hands with corporate CEOs and health officials during his televised remarks from the Rose Garden.  Rebuffing the precautionary isolation measures his own aides were taking, Trump will now spend the weekend sifting through options with White House staff — some of whom are fresh off self-quarantines — about the mechanics of a bailout for industries devastated financially by the virus outbreak. White House aides headed into the complex early Saturday morning for the next round of urgent discussions, a recognition of the tight timeline they’re facing to rescue key sectors of the economy such as transportation and tourism. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are assembling a list of options for Trump to consider as he looks to rescue crumbling industries and protect their workforces, according to two senior administration officials.  At Saturday’s briefing, Mnuchin specifically cited the airlines, cruise ships and hotels as industries that have faced significant challenges from the abrupt crash in global travel and tourism.  Trump’s desire to leap to the assistance of certain industries stems in part from witnessing an upward swing in U.S. markets after he designated the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency on Friday. The declaration had been in the works already, but was pushed up amid historic volatility in financial markets — much of which stemmed from an Oval Office address Wednesday night in which Trump stated he was banning all travel and imports from Europe, which the administration had to later clarify did not block all products and included only the 26-member countries of the unrestricted travel Schengen zone. (The ban will be extended to the U.K. and Ireland, which aren’t members of Schengen.) Trump also claimed insurers would cover the full cost of testing and treatment — generating alarm from health plans that never agreed to waive all patient costs. Outside the White House, many of the president’s political allies viewed Wednesday’s Oval Office address as a speech that quickly needed a do-over. Staring directly into a camera while seated with his hands crossed was not the best format for the president, Trump’s own aides later admitted.  The crushing response on Thursday prompted the White House to schedule Friday’s press conference in the Rose Garden, a favorite venue of the president thanks to its natural lighting and the more free-wheeling format of a back-and-forth press conference, according to two White House officials familiar with the matter.  The president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — among the few officials to maintain the president’s trust throughout his term — also became much more deeply involved in the coronavirus response efforts later in the week as it became clear the White House needed a more forceful response, a senior administration official said.  Internally, aides started to blame officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for flawed testing kits and the amount of time it took to get results back. The administration’s internal criticism of the CDC has made the agency the latest scapegoat as Trump’s team sought to deflect blame and cushion the president from what could become devastating political blowback against the president and his party in the coming months. Morale inside the White House bottomed out on Friday, said a third senior administration official, but turned a corner once the Food and Drug Administration approved a new COVID-19 detection test from the pharmaceutical company Roche as part of an emergency authorization. “They reached the conclusion this week that they had to communicate a sense of seriousness about what was going on and had to reassure the country that they were taking it very seriously,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who remains a close ally of Trump. “Having major companies like Wal-Mart, CVS, etc. involved means suddenly you begin to see how you can move to scale for a country for our size.” The Friday Rose Garden speech, where Trump announced a public-private partnership on testing and the immediate opening of emergency operation centers across the U.S., also helped propel a stock market surge in the final hour of trading. One official later bragged the speech alone caused the “biggest market jump ever.” Trump has repeatedly boasted about the stock market’s rebound after the S&P 500 recorded its best single-day performance since 2008 on Friday — a 9% gain, reversing a Thursday plunge that marked the worst day since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. On Saturday, an unusually jovial Trump said he was “honored” to see positive movement in the markets following his news conference the day before — even joking that he should up the volume of his public appearances to further boost investor confidence.  “I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. Maybe five times per day. That was something to watch,” he said.  But not every element of the president’s course correction has gone smoothly.  Representatives from Google said they were caught off guard on Friday when Trump said the tech company was “helping to develop a website … to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location” for Americans who suspect they may have contracted the coronavirus. In a statement shared on Twitter from Verily, a subsidiary of Google, the company said it is still “developing a tool to help triage individuals for COVID-19 testing” that would initially only be available in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Elsewhere in his remarks, Trump disavowed involvement in disbanding a pandemic unit within the White House National Security Council and about the travel restrictions he has imposed on European countries. The president, more than three years into a presidency in which he has eagerly ejected pre-Trump officials, also blamed the Obama administration for testing shortages in the U.S. that have undermined containment efforts and sowed chaos at some hospitals. “I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,” Trump told reporters, while complaining that his predecessor “didn’t do testing” during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. (In fact, diagnostic kits shipped just weeks after the CDC identified the first case of the virus in April 2009.) Indeed, blaming his predecessors for troubles with his own administration's handling of the current pandemic has become a common tactic of late. He accused former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, on Thursday of overseeing “one of the worst [responses] on record” to a nationwide health epidemic, in reference to that H1N1 outbreak during Obama’s first year in office.  Trump also claimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been working with top Trump aides this week on an emergency aid package, was “trying to create a panic” when his administration faced criticism in late February about its slow response to the coronavirus outbreak.  He blamed Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell for contributing to the economic pullback by refusing to cut interest rates — despite historic action by the central bank this week to combat chaos in financial markets and an emergency rate cut last week.  As economic relief legislation stalled in the House on Friday, Trump said it was congressional Democrats’ fault because “all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things that they agreed to.”  “He has never accepted blame for things that have gone wrong under his watch. Why would he do so now?” said one Republican close to the White House, who claimed the tactic “has worked in the past” for the president.  Although White House aides felt confident about Trump’s message on Friday about testing and the stimulus package passed by the House early Saturday, aides also acknowledged that the next step in rescuing the economy — deciding which industries to bail out — will be much harder politically.  The potential cost of an industry bailout could upset Republican lawmakers who have grumbled for years about the ballooning national debt under their watch after fighting the Obama administration over even smaller deficits and debt levels.  “It quickly devolves into industry vs. industry and parochial stuff,” said one former senior administration official. Trump also remains intent on pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, continuing to drop it into his public remarks.  “If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!” he tweeted on Friday.  Democrats and Senate Republicans have been cool to that idea, in part because of the eye-popping price tag ($950 billion according to one estimate) and concerns among economists about whether it would be effective in preventing a severe economic downturn. As the president entered the weekend, however, he appeared intent on striking a more unifying tone. Before meeting with members of the coronavirus task force at the White House, Trump commended the “good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats” that led to the House’s passage of a bill that will expand paid emergency leave and provide tax credits for workers and employers affected by the coronavirus crisis. The legislation also includes $1 billion in food aid for low-income Americans.  “People really pulled together. Nice to see!” Trump tweeted. He even praised the media — whom he accused last week of trying to “inflame the CoronaVirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant” — for recent coverage of his administration’s response to the crisis. “Over the past 24 hours, I think the representation has been very fair. It’s been very fair,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.",From complacency to emergency: How Trump changed course on coronavirus ,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/how-trump-changed-course-on-coronavirus-129528,politico
"Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that he still plans to offer more details about a planned website to help screen people for coronavirus symptoms — a day after President Donald Trump's description of it as a massive Google project appeared to surprise even the company. ""Tomorrow, 5 o'clock, we'll have a very specific description tomorrow about when the website will be available,"" Pence told reporters at a White House news conference, adding that he thought the site would be available Monday. ""As we expand testing across the country, we want people to be able to go to a website,"" Pence added in response to a later question. ""There will be a questionnaire there to determine whether or not a test is in order, because we want to make sure that people are being tested that have the symptoms."" Trump had announced the project during a Rose Garden address Friday afternoon, saying that for people who may have coronavirus symptoms, the website will help ""determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location."" Trump added that ""we have many, many locations. ... We cover this country and large parts of the world."" But later on Friday, Google tweeted a statement from its life sciences affiliate, Verily, that described the project as having a more modest scope, at least initially. ""Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,"" said the company, which is owned by Google's parent, Alphabet. Google appeared to walk that back Saturday night by posting a Twitter thread much more consistent with the White House's description: ""Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information,"" it wrote, adding that this was in addition to ""Work being done by our sister company Verily to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area."" Google was also taking steps such as ""[p]romoting authoritative information through Google Search and YouTube"" and weeding out ""phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation."" Neither Google and Verily responded to attempts to reconcile their various statements with the administration's accounts. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Saturday that the site will incorporate ""everything they have learned about symptoms and screening"" for the virus. ""It's not just a simple checkbox website,"" she said. ""It's actually going to go through critical symptoms, and that's why we're giving ourselves the weekend to get it put up."" Friday's announcement instantly raised red flags among patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. Google recently came under fire over a deal with Ascension Health that grants the tech giant access to millions of patients' identifiable medical information. While Google contends the deal complies with federal privacy protections for health data, a Wall Street Journal report on the deal triggered an investigation by the HHS civil rights office and landed the company in the crosshairs of congressional privacy hawks. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have demanded answers from Google and Ascension. Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it’s critical for consumer privacy that Google doesn’t gather any personally identifiable information from the coronavirus website, and that it shouldn’t keep IP addresses or use any other “covert tracking techniques.” The White House has sought the tech industry's help bolstering its response to the expanding outbreak. U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios held a conference call Wednesday with representatives from large tech firms, including Google, Facebook and Amazon, to discuss their efforts to combat coronavirus-related online misinformation and ways artificial intelligence could be used to analyze medical research on the virus. “Cutting-edge technology companies and major online platforms will play a critical role in this all-hands-on-deck effort,” Kratsios said in a statement after the call. “Today’s meeting outlined an initial path forward and we intend to continue this important conversation.” Mohana Ravindranath, Darius Tahir and Steven Overly contributed to this report.",Pence promises more details on virus screening website,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/pence-coronavirus-website-129530,politico
"The White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland in an attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S., a further expansion of restrictions on air travel that haven’t been seen since Sept. 11, 2001. The administration had previously banned foreign nationals from flying into the United States from the 26 countries in the Schengen Area free movement zone, but not the U.K. and Ireland, despite the existence of the coronavirus in those countries. The ban on travel from other parts of Europe began at midnight on Saturday, White House officials said at a press conference on Saturday. The ban on the two new countries will be implemented at midnight Monday night, Eastern Daylight Time. Trump spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday, according to a readout released by the White House.  The move is sure to push airlines further into crisis after they have been struggling financially for weeks amid a steep slump in passenger demand. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said economic aid could soon be coming for airlines and cruise lines after Congress passed two pieces of coronavirus relief legislation that didn’t include provisions for those industries. ""We have a lot more we need to do with Congress, and the speaker and I have acknowledged that we will be working starting immediately,” Mnuchin said. “The airlines industry in particular, no different than after 9/11, has a very unique circumstances — the cruise industry, the hotel industry. I would say we’ve got a lot more work to do.” Airlines are already struggling with massive losses, with some carriers having more canceled flights than new bookings for April and May. Delta Air Lines announced Friday that it is slashing 40 percent of its flight capacity, a massive cut. The reduction in flights is the steepest in Delta's history, including the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks. A senior TSA official said Saturday that there has been a ""significant"" drop in the number of both domestic and international air travelers. ""This can be as much as 30 percent — some locations, higher,"" the official said. However, the White House and airlines have been in discussions about the impact the coronavirus is having on their businesses, and what aid might be needed. Nothing has been finalized or made public, but those discussions, for now, appear to be centered around letting airlines keep some of the excise taxes passengers pay as part of the price of a ticket. However, one of those charges typically is funneled to airports to help pay for capital improvements, and airports, themselves looking at billions in losses as travel continues to slump, are likely to fight such a change. Similarly, one of the taxes — about 7.5 percent of the cost of an airline ticket — is used to help pay to run the Federal Aviation Administration, which Congress may not endorse if it is waived for anything longer than a few months. The European travel ban does not apply to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents or their family members, but they will be directed to one of 13 airports with enhanced screening procedures in place. Some domestic travel restrictions may also be under consideration. When asked Saturday whether he was “considering other travel restrictions, perhaps domestically,“ President Donald Trump answered: “Specifically from certain areas, yes we are, and we’re working with the states and we’re considering other restrictions.”  On a call with reporters later Saturday, a senior DHS official said domestic travel restrictions weren't expected ""at this time."" Though the administration has been intensely focused on reducing flights from coronavirus-exposed countries, there are indications that health screenings for international travelers arriving at U.S. airports have been spotty. Passengers returning from coronavirus hotspots around the globe have reported that despite coming straight from countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks, Customs and Border Protection officers and health officers in U.S. airports did not ask them questions about their travel histories, take their temperatures or check them for coronavirus symptoms.

"President Donald Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said Saturday evening after the president held a press briefing on the administration's latest moves to combat the outbreak. The president consented to a test Friday night, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley said in a statement, and he remains symptom-free one week after dining with a Brazilian government delegation, some of whose members have tested positive for the illness, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The statement did not say if Trump will be re-tested. Trump said that he has been tested for coronavirus after being questioned about it during a Rose Garden address on Friday. “I also took the test last night,"" Trump said during the White House briefing. ""And I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking, 'Did I take the test?'"" Asked when test results would be returned, he said: ""A day, two days. They send it to a lab."" Trump also touted the bipartisan congressional funding package passed early Saturday and the rise in the stock markets following his Rose Garden address. ""I was honored to see that the stock market, you were mostly there with us, set a record in a short period of time, over 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the rose garden,"" Trump said. ""That was a record. All-time record. I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. How about five times a day? We'll do one five times a day."" He also announced that the White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland, also hinting that relief for the airline and cruise industry would be coming soon. The president was joined at the press event by Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and health officials, including Seema Verma, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, who have been leading the administration's response to the outbreak. Not present was Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose standing has been diminished in the wake of the outbreak.  ""Secretary Azar was at the coronavirus task force meeting this morning. He's back to work, and we will have a changing round-up of these presentations so we can get quickly to your questions,"" Pence said in response to a question about the absence of the administration's top health official. ""But secretary Azar is doing a remarkable job, and working seven days a week for the American people and making a difference."" The vice president, pressed on the messaging discrepancies from the White House around whether Trump needed to get tested, told reporters he’d consult with the White House physician on getting a diagnostic himself after today’s briefing. “Mrs. Pence and I will be more than happy to get tested,” he said, after stating that the physician on Friday night had said Pence and his wife didn’t have the “symptoms or contacts that would necessitate testing.” He also said he’d had his temperature checked earlier. White House staff barred at least one person from the press briefing room after checking the temperatures of journalists who gathered for the event Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel experienced a fever and flu-like conditions Friday evening and went to a Michigan hospital for treatment, according to the RNC. She is self-quarantining at home with her family. The president has been criticized for repeatedly shaking hands in public and on camera despite the advice of public health officials to refrain from the practice.  At the press briefing, he defended his actions but also said that ""getting away from shaking hands is a good thing."" Late Friday, press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a memo from Conley saying Trump had dined at Mar-a-Lago with a person who has since tested positive for coronavirus. Conley did not recommend testing the president as a necessity. Conley on Saturday said he had been in touch with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House Coronavirus Task Force and that his office is “encouraging the implementation of all their best practices.” Earlier Saturday, Trump hailed the bipartisan deal on a congressional coronavirus funding package on Twitter, adding that he'd attended a series of coronavirus-related meetings in the White House that morning.  He also tweeted: ""SOCIAL DISTANCING!"" As of Saturday, the U.S. had reached 50 reported coronavirus-related deaths and over 2,200 confirmed cases. Despite Trump’s announcement that’s he’s been tested, health officials at Saturday’s press conference urged Americans to begin isolating themselves instead of rushing to get tested if they’re not experiencing symptoms.  Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator said said Quest and LabCorp — two private labs currently running diagnostics — are reporting 98 percent to 99 percent of their tests are coming back negative for coronavirus.  Though early missteps have prevented widespread testing necessary to track the spread of the virus and isolate sick individuals, Birx and other administration health officials said they were optimistic about the steps the administration is taking to ramp up testing. The administration on Friday announced steps that would allow some labs that have been processing tens or hundreds of samples a day to instead handle thousands. The U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea can test in a day. Pence said the administration would release more details at a briefing Sunday evening on progress in the effort to expand testing. Health officials Saturday said they were optimistic that the new measures will allow the U.S. to begin understanding how the disease is spreading. “Now it's all systems go,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “As we get knowledge about new testing, we'll alleviate the anxiety that we have in the world about, we don't know what's going on.” “Now it's all systems go,” Fauci said. “Let's look forward.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report."," Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, White House physician says",2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-test-129444,politico

"The nation's top doctor on Saturday urged a widespread halt of hospital elective procedures amid mounting concern that the health system doesn't have enough beds to manage a potential surge of coronavirus cases. ""Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!"" U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted this morning.  He warned that every elective surgery could spread coronavirus within the facility, use up protective medical gear as public officials worry about shortages and burden a hospital workforce who ""may be needed"" to respond to COVID-19. Adams was responding to new recommendations from the American College of Surgeons issued Friday. The group said hospitals, health systems and surgeons should ""thoughtfully review"" all their scheduled operations and consider canceling or postponing them ""until we have passed the predicted inflection point"" in the disease spread and ""can be confident that our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.""

"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"Scott Gottlieb left the Trump administration nearly a year ago — but from Twitter to TV, he’s become the face of truth-telling about the coronavirus pandemic. The 47-year-old former Food and Drug Administration commissioner is providing blunt reality checks on talk shows and in congressional chambers, where his warnings about undetected outbreaks and testing delays starkly contrast with current administration officials’ assurances that the risk from the fast-spreading virus remains very low. “And all I say is, ‘Be calm.’ We have the greatest people in the world,” President Donald Trump told reporters on March 6 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “You never really know when something like this is going to strike and what it’s going to be.” Gottlieb had a different take. “People will suffer and die. The most vulnerable are at greatest risk,” Gottlieb tweeted the next morning. “We must all work together to protect them. The next few months will be hard, but we will preserve life, and eventually conquer this pathogen.” Gottlieb’s hard truths were finally embraced on Thursday morning by the president, who retweeted a series of Gottlieb’s warnings hours after Trump’s prime-time coronavirus address was widely panned. “We need to sacrifice some of the trappings of normal life to reduce the scope and severity of what’s ahead,” Gottlieb wrote — and Trump retweeted — in a series of tweets that also took shots at the ""void left by policy makers.” Gottlieb’s emergence has made him the rare Trump administration insider who’s found ways to critique his old colleagues’ decisions from outside while still maintaining respect in Trump's inner circle. In some ways his plain-spoken warnings mirror those of Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old NIH infectious disease expert who’s become a mainstay at congressional and White House task force briefings even as he contradicts the president’s reassurances or optimistic timelines. Widespread mistrust of the administration’s take on the coronavirus has enhanced the role of an outsider like Gottlieb. And his ubiquity has made his estimates even more valued. Some have pointed to a coronavirus testing tracker that Gottlieb and the free market American Enterprise Institute established this week to estimate how many people could be tested for the infection each day — an initiative that aggravated some government health officials, despite Trump’s retweets. Gottlieb also suggested that health systems could run coronavirus tests on a high-volume platform developed by drug giant Roche weeks before the administration authorized the strategy on Friday. The Monday morning quarterbacking, especially around early testing stumbles, has particularly ruffled some feathers in the health department, where HHS Secretary Alex Azar is already dealing with criticism from White House officials — and where current FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has been virtually invisible on television during the crisis. “I don’t know what his endgame is,” said one official, criticizing Gottlieb’s high profile, arguing that some of it’s come at the expense of his successor. “What’s he trying to prove, and why does he keep stepping on Hahn?” Some officials also grumbled after Gottlieb penned Wall Street Journal editorials about preparedness in January and early February, claiming that his warnings about silent coronavirus spread were too alarmist — even if they’ve turned out to be true. It’s set up the media-savvy former FDA chief — who remains in frequent conversation with the White House and won as much bipartisan support as any Trump appointee while in office — for inevitable run-ins with current health officials who don’t have the latitude to make the same kind of policy pronouncements. “He can say things that maybe the government would like to say because he has an authority,” said a source close to HHS. But at the end of the day: “They are making decisions that are going to affect 350 million Americans. He’s not.” Others on the inside of the coronavirus battle say Gottlieb has been indispensable to the White House and Pence in particular on response strategy. They say consternation is rooted in Azar’s insecurity about his role and concerns that he could be undercut by Gottlieb, who had been rumored as a shortlist pick for a so-called coronavirus czar. “I think good leaders want to bring the strongest, smartest minds in and surround themselves,” said one administration official. “But that’s not what they’re doing [at HHS].” A source close to Azar disputed that characterization and frustration with Gottlieb, and the idea Azar that has been sidelined.  Gottlieb was seen at the White House ahead of Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a source, and he later praised Trump's Rose Garden event. Gottlieb declined to comment for this story. He now divides his time between a fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute, serving on a handful of drug company boards and a career as a talking head who has the rare ability to explain complicated science in a way ordinary people can understand. Some of that has been to the administration’s adversaries on Capitol Hill. The libertarian doctor’s activist agenda as FDA chief, on everything from e-cigarettes to nutrition, often put him at odds with the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory approach. But Gottlieb sold his proposals well — and left the administration on rare good footing with the White House and lawmakers from both parties in Congress. “You do have big shoes to fill,” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) told Hahn, Gottlieb’s successor, at a House hearing Wednesday where Democrats grilled him on the flawed White House response to the coronavirus. Just one day earlier, Gottlieb gave his take on the state of the outbreak to Pocan and the rest of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at their invitation. “We don’t have a whole lot of, honestly, Trump appointees, American Enterprise Institute employees, come by to brief the Progressive Caucus. But he got it because we respect him so much,” Pocan told Hahn. Meanwhile, HHS has said it doesn’t know how many tests have been done, and the CDC has dropped its own count from its website. Instead, the administration has been updating how many tests have been shipped to labs, not how fast the troubled testing program can turn them around. Azar said the CDC is working to get its own testing tracker up. Gottlieb also has stepped into a void around Hahn, who has kept a low profile throughout the crisis — posting relatively few coronavirus tweets, making no appearances on prime-time TV programs, and waiting a month before the White House even added him to its coronavirus task force. And when asked about the testing numbers his predecessor is projecting, Hahn said it’s complicated. “I would want to get you the most accurate information possible,” he told lawmakers. Hahn, a cancer doctor and health system administrator, is constrained in ways that Gottlieb is not, allies argue. Two administration officials said that early testing delays were rooted in Azar’s decision early on to leave Hahn off the coronavirus task force, where he could have coordinated more easily with CDC Director Robert Redfield to let private labs roll out their own tests. “He wasn’t given the opportunity to be involved and that’s what created the problems,” said one administration official. Hahn was eventually brought on the task force, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams and CMS Administrator Seema Verma, after Vice President Mike Pence was tapped to take the lead. An HHS spokesperson said Hahn has been involved in briefing Azar and others from the very beginning and Azar is pleased he is part of the task force. “We are and have been focused on addressing this public health emergency, and not who was appointed to the task force or when,” Hahn said in a statement to POLITICO. Yet what looked like early stumbles and confusion among administration officials has driven frustration among lawmakers — and now they are turning to Gottlieb. “I just feel that there's been such confusion and miscommunication at the presidential level that we're constantly playing catch-up,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) whose state has reported at least nine cases of coronavirus. “Even though he's on the conservative side, you know the ideas that he's pushing forward are important and they've been smart,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who attended Gottlieb’s closed-door briefing with progressive members and whose state has become the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak. “His deep-seated interest in public health issues is genuine, it’s who he was before. It’s just getting more attention, it’s magnified now,” said a former HHS official. “What’s the long game? He’s going to keep writing op-eds.” Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.",The shadow coronavirus czar,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/shadow-coronavirus-czar-scott-gottlieb-129563,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"SEATTLE, Wash.—As of Friday, the coronavirus outbreak is officially a national emergency. But while most Americans are only just becoming familiar with social distancing and quarantining, Washington state has been dealing with the crisis since the first U.S. case was discovered there on January 20. The Seattle area, in particular, has become Ground Zero in the United States after the first death from the epidemic on February 29. Now, the buzzing birthplace of Starbucks and home of tech giants like Amazon has, in large part, shut down, foreshadowing what could come for the rest of the country. In Washington’s most populated city, large events and entire sports seasons are being cancelled or postponed; schools, libraries, community centers and the zoo are closing; some hospitals and prisons have banned visitors; and public health officials are urging businesses to allow employees to work remotely. Governor Jay Inslee has banned gatherings of 250 or more people in three counties, including Seattle’s King County. A usually bustling city is now eerily silent and still. Over the last week, Seattle-based photographer Chona Kasinger documented the ghost town that it’s become. Text by Ruairí Arrieta-Kenna. Pike Place Market is usually a hub of activity, filled with locals and tourists buying fish, flowers or produce. But what would usually be a busy weekend for the century-old farmers’ market was instead a sleepy Sunday on March 8—after the statewide total of known coronavirus cases crossed into triple digits and the number of deaths into double digits. Since King County officials urged employers on March 4 to allow people to work remotely, the once traffic-heavy city of Seattle has come to a near standstill. While many restaurants and shops remain open, many would-be patrons are staying home, and some businesses are starting to close. According to the Seattle Times, more than 50 restaurants and bars, including a dozen by local celebrity chef Tom Douglas, have already shut their doors in the past two weeks. In Seattle, much like other parts of the country, stores have been marked by long lines and low supplies as people stock up on provisions. The coronavirus is known to be deadlier to people over 60, with the vast majority of the 32 deaths in King County as of Saturday linked to a single retirement community. While young people have generally been spared from the virus’ worst symptoms and might feel less hesitant to avoid public places, state officials are weighing even more drastic measures to make sure they don’t become carriers of the disease.",America’s Coronavirus Ground Zero,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/seattle-ghost-town-coronavirus-ground-zero-128720,politico
"TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s official leading the response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East on Sunday acknowledged that the pandemic could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe U.S. sanctions. Muslim authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, would be closed indefinitely due to concerns about the outbreak, with prayers continuing to be held on the sprawling esplanade outside. Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government. Iran is battling one of the worst outbreaks outside China. On Sunday the Health Ministry reported 113 more deaths, bringing the country’s death toll to 724 amid 13,938 confirmed cases. The real number of infections could be even higher, as questions have been raised about the government’s transparency. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying earlier by the state-run IRNA news agency. Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed. Zali also acknowledged that “many” of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly. Health Ministry figures show that while 55% of fatalities were in their 60s, some 15% were younger than 40. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks. The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,800. More than 70,000 people worldwide have recovered after being infected. In Iran, the virus has infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials. Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open. Dalia Samhouri, a senior regional official with the World Health Organization, said both Iran and Egypt, two of the most populous countries in the Middle East, were likely underreporting cases because of the nature of the virus, which can be spread by individuals who show no visible symptoms. “We can easily say that the current figures are an underestimation of the actual figures,” she said. Iran has struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. The U.S. says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it. Countries across the Middle East have imposed sweeping travel restrictions, canceled public events and in some cases called on non-essential businesses to close for the coming weeks. In the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, a global business and travel hub in the United Arab Emirates, authorities announced on Sunday that all movie theaters, arcades and gyms would be closed through the end of the month. Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, also shut down its amusement parks and museums through the end of the month, including Louvre Abu Dhabi. The UAE’s central bank meanwhile announced a $27 billion stimulus package directed at supporting banks and said regulatory limits on loans will be eased. Saudi Arabia announced its own $13 billion stimulus plan. Al-Aqsa is the latest in a series of religious sites where access has been halted or strictly limited. Saudi Arabia has halted the umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and could be forced to limit or cancel the much larger haj later this year. On Sunday, it announced the temporary closure of all mosques and called off Friday prayers. Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the director of the Al-Aqsa mosque, said Sunday that the closure of the mosque and other buildings on the compound, including the iconic golden Dome of the Rock, would continue indefinitely. The religious site is also the holiest in Judaism because it was the location of the two Jewish temples in antiquity. Israel occupied and annexed east Jerusalem in the 1967 war in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, and the religious site has often been a flashpoint in the decades-long conflict. Israel imposed sweeping travel and quarantine measures more than a week ago but has seen its number of confirmed cases double in recent days, to around 200. On Saturday, the government said restaurants, malls, movies, gyms and daycare centers would close. Schools and universities have already been shut down until next month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial on serious corruption charges, which was supposed to begin this week, was postponed for two months due to restrictions on public gatherings. Netanyahu has meanwhile been pressing for an emergency unity government with his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, following three inconclusive elections and more than a year of political deadlock. Gantz has appeared open to the idea. Jordan, which had previously reported just one infection in a man who later recovered, confirmed six new cases. Four are French tourists while the other two are Jordanians, Health Minister Saad Jaber said Sunday. Jordan has suspended all flights into and out of the kingdom except for aid workers and diplomats, and has closed schools for two weeks. It has also banned the smoking of hookahs, or water pipes, in cafes.",Iran says worsening outbreak could strain health facilities,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/iran-says-worsening-outbreak-could-strain-health-facilities-129895,politico
"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination, and staying in the race just to try to convince Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential question in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. Back in 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before, but only after nomination by this party.” He called Ike the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Richard Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisors, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most important. when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed onto platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on the civil rights. On that issue, the Compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious that Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base, and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African-Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for “the Dreamers”—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for the undocumented. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers, and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of the Sanders’ supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: when and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, not Burlington.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to block Trump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",2 senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and so not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the new restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash for Americans abroad to return home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anothony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member you can get back. You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s new travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. But Fauci said Sunday that there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there was anything airports could do to try and mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back, it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, from Sophocles to Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared exactly the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran; to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad; and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. “The Plague” is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe, and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, where plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only five at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from the divine will and the rise of conmen to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene where blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short-lived, and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence, and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extra-marital liaisons, who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, “The Betrothed” gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the so-called “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. “The Last Man” by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakens Athens in its war with Sparta, and claims the life of the city’s great statesman Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparks a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to commit suicide in bizarre ways.

"Top health official Anthony Fauci said Sunday that after strict containment and mitigation, China’s coronavirus outbreak is “coming down right now.” On ABC’s “This Week,” the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that it takes several weeks to a few months for the outbreak to dwindle, pointing to China and South Korea as examples.  China, where COVID-19 first set off alarms, passed through the worst, Fauci said. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the country has had the bulk of the cases and fatalities: nearly 81,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,200 deaths.  Recently, China reported just 11 new cases — minuscule compared to the numbers it used to see, Fauci said. South Korea’s coronavirus spread is also starting to flatten. “If you look at that bracket, all of that was a couple of months, a month-and-a-half for China,” he said Sunday. “The way you interfere with that … depends on the effectiveness in which you do the kinds of controls that we've been talking about, the containment and the mitigation.”  China, Fauci added, really dramatically practiced “social distancing” when officials shut down the country. Now, all eyes are on what happens as people resume normal life.  “It's over for now and hopefully for good,” Fauci said. “As they start getting back to normal personal interaction, I hope we don't see the second blip, but it's possible.”  The worst may also be over in South Korea, Fauci said. “Korea is starting to flatten and maybe come down a little,” he said. Worldwide, there are over 156,000 confirmed cases and over 5,800 deaths. In the United States, there have been more than 2,900 cases and 57 deaths. Many public spaces, schools and offices have closed as millions of Americans are encouraged to reduce close contact with others.  On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted to reinforce that message: “SOCIAL DISTANCING!”",Top U.S. health official: China’s situation is improving,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-china-korea-130027,politico
"The nation’s top infectious disease expert warned Sunday that Americans should prepare to take far more drastic steps to blunt the rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which has sickened thousands of Americans across the country and prompted calls for a wide-scale withdrawal from public life. “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview airing on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His warning comes as the virus has caused the cancellation of events across the globe, as well as travel bans — and in some countries, domestic travel restrictions. Health officials have warned Americans to practice social distancing to limit the amount of community transmission and avoid overwhelming an already-strained health care system.  Asked Sunday whether he would favor the kind of national lockdown ordered by Italy’s prime minister, Fauci said he would rather err on the side of being “overly aggressive.”  “You know, I would prefer as much as we possibly could,” Fauci responded. “I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.” Fauci said he’d broached these concerns with the White House, which has taken increasingly significant steps over the last week as the number of U.S. cases exploded. He said that there had not been pushback to his suggestions, noting that “in fairness, they listen and they generally go with what we say.” While Fauci said “much more” needed to be done on the social distancing front, he conceded that some Americans would ultimately do what they please. “I mean, obviously, you're going to have people who are going to go to restaurants anyway,” he said, when asked by “Meet the Press” anchor Chuck Todd about packed restaurants and bars as people celebrated St. Patrick’s Day over the weekend. “But for the most part, and particularly, if I can say this, this is particularly appropriate and relevant for people at the higher risk. The elderly and those who have underlying conditions right now should really hunker down.” He reiterated, though, that it was better to be safe than sorry.  “The golden rule that I say is that, when you think you are doing too much, you are probably doing enough or not enough,” he argued, urging Americans not to be “complacent.”  “Don’t even, for a second, think that I am saying we shouldn’t — I like to be criticized,"" he added. ""When I say oh, you are being too overactive, that is good for me.”",Fauci: Americans should be prepared to 'hunker down' even more,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fauci-americans-hunker-down-130035,politico
"Voters are divided along party lines on how President Donald Trump is handling the burgeoning coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., according to a new poll out Sunday that shows a majority predicting it won’t change their lives in a significant way. Nearly half of voters in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 45 percent, approve of the job Trump is doing in handling the outbreak, slightly fewer than the 51 percent who disapprove. That nearly matches Trump’s overall approval rating of 46 percent, which is statistically unchanged from a month ago. The partisan split on Trump’s handling of the virus is wide: While 81 percent of self-identified Republican voters approve of how the president is handling the situation, 84 percent of Democrats disapprove. Among independent voters, 43 percent approve, and 52 percent disapprove. More strikingly, a significant share of voters, mostly Republicans, say they don’t expect the outbreak to have major effects on their daily lives — a view that runs counter to the recommendations of public-health officials. The poll was conducted March 11-13, surveying 900 registered voters. It went into the field the day of Trump’s address to the nation on the outbreak on Wednesday, the same day the NBA suspended its season after a player, Utah’s Rudy Gobert, contracted the virus and actor Tom Hanks announced he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, had also tested positive for coronavirus. Only 15 percent of voters say they expect the virus to change their lives “in a very major way,” and an additional 26 percent say they think it will change their lives “in a fairly major way.” But 39 percent expect only “small” changes, and 17 percent say it won’t change their lives in any way. The combined 41 percent who expect major changes to their lives includes 56 percent of Democrats, but only 26 percent of Republicans. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say they have or will be canceling travel plans (47 percent, versus 23 percent) or plan to stop eating at restaurants (36 percent, versus 12 percent). “Simply put, it is very clear that partisanship has infected our views of the coronavirus,” Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt told NBC News. Voters do expect things to get worse: Roughly six-in-10, 60 percent, said the worst is yet to come. But 6 percent said the worst was already passed, and 31 percent said they don’t expect coronavirus to be a major problem in the U.S. And despite the effects already seen — a wave of cancellations of public events, the tumbling stock market and the strain on the health care system — the share of voters saying the country is headed in the right direction (37 percent) is statistically unchanged from last December (35 percent). Voters are split on their confidence in Trump to handle the crisis: 48 percent say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in Trump, while 50 percent no or “not very much” confidence in him. By contrast, voters are more confident in their state government (75 percent great deal or fair amount of confidence), their local government (72 percent) or the federal government as a whole (62 percent). The poll also tested opinions of Democratic voters following last week’s presidential primaries. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the first choice of Democrats, with 61 percent saying they would favor him if a primary were being held in their state today. That’s nearly double the percentage choosing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 32 percent. Four percent of Democrats choose Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). In hypothetical general election matchups, both Biden and Sanders lead Trump, though Biden’s 9-point advantage, 52 percent to 43 percent, is slightly larger than Sanders’ 4-point lead, 49 percent to 45 percent. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for all registered voters, and 4.7 percentage points for Democratic primary voters.",Poll: Voters split on Trump’s handling of coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/poll-voters-coronavirus-outbreak-130033,politico
"Illinois’ governor complained late Saturday that new travel restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic have led to an impossible situation at Chicago’s biggest airport. “The crowds & lines O’Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately,“ Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted Saturday. He added: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.“ Enhanced screening for returning travelers from Europe is creating massive logjams at U.S. airports, with travelers waiting hours in long lines to get their luggage and clear customs. Having travelers stuck in huge crowds — while public health officials urgently advise people to keep their distance — is also creating concerns that the virus could spread at airports. “To the frustrated people trying to get home, I have spoken with the mayor and our Senators and we are working together to get the federal government to act to solve this. We will do everything within our power to get relief,” the governor tweeted. Mayor Lori Lightfoot echoed Pritzker’s criticisms on Twitter: “This is unacceptable.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday dodged questions about whether the coronavirus pandemic could plunge the U.S. into a recession, insisting that the reeling stock market would eventually get back on track and that the Trump administration is more focused on targeting short-term relief to those most impacted by the fast-spreading disease.  In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the secretary repeatedly sought to avoid getting pinned down on a number of issues relating to the surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. after he spent the last week negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the details of an economic aid package that he referred to as just the “second inning” of relief. “I wouldn't focus on the technical issue of whether we are going to be in a recession or not,” Mnuchin told host Chris Wallace, arguing that the administration is more concerned about what it can immediately do to blunt the impact of the outbreak. The virus has prompted the shuttering of schools, the cancellation of sporting and entertainment events and outright travel bans, while fears over the novel coronavirus have contributed to a turbulent month on Wall Street.  The stock market over the last few weeks has shattered records for its greatest one-day gains but also for point drops, posting numbers not seen since the 1987 crash and ending an 11-year bull market run. The Federal Reserve has already stepped in to try and calm investors' fears, but those moves have gotten bowled over by new developments in the outbreak.  But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin continued, arguing that the current market rout has very different origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus wasn’t comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus,” he argued. Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment was the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill that Congress approved earlier this month, and would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship -- there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how much of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushed back on the idea that the relief measures currently under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2009 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, Mnuchin argued that there were no such issues contributing to the current market tumble. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico

"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash of Americans abroad returning home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member, you can get back. You don't need to rush back — you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. Fauci said Sunday there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there is anything airports could do to try to mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back — it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" In a statement, the Biden campaign signaled that the former vice president is not planning on hammering away at contrasts with Sanders and instead wants to focus on Trump. Biden is ""honored to share the stage with Sen. Sanders, who he considers a good friend and whose values and leadership he admires,"" said Andrew Bates, Biden’s rapid response director. For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"Massive lines ballooned across several U.S. airports this weekend as European travelers made a mad dash for home — a situation created by the quick rollout of the Trump administration’s European travel ban and exacerbated chronic airport staffing shortages.  U.S. officials promised Sunday to address the most visible sign of the chaos — the jam-packed terminals where Americans returning to the U.S. are waiting hours for virus screening at several major airports, including Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth and Dulles International. But those lines are just one of a series of pressure points that have undermined the administration’s efforts to keep the virus from entering the country — and now threaten to hasten its spread: — The administration’s European travel ban, which President Donald Trump announced Wednesday and went into effect Friday night, sent Americans abroad scrambling to find plane tickets back home. U.S. officials eventually clarified that the ban didn't apply to American citizens or permanent residents — but by then, panic-buying most likely inflated the number of people trying to reenter at once. — The administration also dramatically narrowed the number of places where air travelers returning from Europe could enter the U.S. — currently just 13 airports. At the same time, Customs and Border Protection and health officials on Friday began doing ""enhanced screening"" for those passengers, consisting of temperature checks and questions about travel history and symptoms, without having enough staff on hand to process them quickly. — Customs staffing levels have been inadequate for some time. The union representing Customs screeners said at a hearing in December that the force was short 2,700 officers, partly as a result of the administration’s decision to temporarily reassign people to the U.S.-Mexican border. — In the early weeks of the outbreak, the administration was slow to ramp up screening at international airports, even for travelers re-entering the United States from known coronavirus hot spots. Harvard public health researchers warned in early March that the screening procedures in place then would miss as many as two-thirds of U.S.-bound passengers entering the U.S. Now, public health officials are expressing concern that the passengers crammed shoulder-to-shoulder in airport screening lines are at higher risk for catching and then spreading the virus. “It’s not good public health policy to have crowds of people in tight spaces, especially people who are returning from places where we know there’s widespread transmission occurring,” said John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America’s Health. He added that there should be serious consideration of unintended consequences of the policies being implemented. Illinois leaders blamed the Trump administration for the latest mess, saying it was apparently unprepared to carry out its own orders. “Appears source of delays all federal and Admin was unprepared after Presidential ban on travel from Europe,” said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin on Twitter. The state’s governor, JB Pritzker, wrote: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Saturday that the added screenings are only taking around 60 seconds per passenger. But that doesn’t help if not enough screeners are on duty. And some passengers complained on social media that they waited as long as six or seven hours to be screened. CBP's acting commissioner, Mark Morgan, said in a statement Sunday that the agency is ""working diligently to address the longer than usual delays"" and several airports are already improving. A spokesperson was not able to provide details about any specific steps the agency had taken to get lines under control. ""We appreciate the patience of the traveling public as we deal with this unprecedented situation,"" Morgan said. ""We’re continuing to balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens through enhanced medical screening."" The thousands of people who have been jammed into close quarters while waiting for their bags and customs checks could be at a greater health risk because of the situation. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Fox News Sunday the crowds are “countermanding” the administration’s own mitigation efforts. Public health officials have frequently stressed the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. “What people need to understand is if you're an American is if you're an American citizen, you can get back,” Fauci said. “You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back but it's understandable how when people see the travel ban, they immediately want to hunker and get home. “Hopefully we don't have more of that, but I think we probably unfortunately will see that,"" he said. Mike Fraser, executive director for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the large crowds at ports of entry are concerning. “While travel home is essential for these individuals, I would hope federal and airport authorities would work with the airlines and state and local health agencies to practice appropriate infection control measures everywhere, but especially in places were crowds are gathered and recommend staggered arrivals to reduce the number of people congregating in one place, ""Fraser said. “At this time, the goal is to prevent transmission of disease. Any crowded space — churches, grocery stores, airports — all increase the probability of transmission,” said Joyce Johnson, a senior retired U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer. These enhanced screenings are also starting too late, following weeks while the virus was already rapidly spreading around the world. The administration’s initial screening efforts focused on travelers from China, even after it had become clear that the virus had spread to other countries. Marc Lipsitch, head of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, has said the lax screening of infected travelers may have led to the outbreak in Washington state, the first U.S. state the virus swept through. Before this weekend, alarmed passengers had reported on social media what they considered lax screening as they returned to the U.S. Jenn Bartick, a California attorney, told POLITICO that she flew back from Italy two weeks ago and went through “no screening of any type."" She said no one asked her if she had been in the parts of Italy that have been hardest hit by the virus, a spread that since prompted Italian authorities to shut down the entire country. She said when she boarded the plane in Italy, “they asked if I had been to China in the past 14 days. No further screening.” She’s been unable to get a test because she doesn’t have symptoms and is self-quarantining. A U.S. businessman who flew recently from Hong Kong told POLITICO that the screening he underwent at Los Angeles International Airport was ""a joke."" “As opposed to all arrivals and departures at all Asian airports there was no temperature taking,” said the businessman, who has lived in China and other Asian countries for decades and requested anonymity because he doesn't want to “get blacklisted on flights” to the United States added: “No questions, nothing. Couldn’t get rid of the passengers fast enough.” Customs officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about those passengers’ accounts. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has asked the federal government to expand screening beyond air travel, by requiring temperature checks for all passengers boarding not just airplanes but mass transit. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, told lawmakers last week that passenger screening “bought us time” but said travel restrictions and screenings were never “intended to be a hermetically sealed process.”",Terminal crush: Air passengers caught in Trump's travel ban,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/air-passengers-crush-coronavirus-trump-130251,politico
"The nation’s top infectious diseases expert has a stern warning to young people: Don’t get complacent about statistics showing that serious coronavirus cases and fatalities are skewed toward the elderly and those with underlying health issues.  “You are not immune or safe from getting seriously ill,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked if younger Americans should be concerned about contracting the virus, which Fauci has repeatedly said is more lethal than the average flu.  “Even though when you look at the total numbers, it's overwhelmingly weighted toward the elderly and those with underlying conditions,” he explained, “the virus isn't a mathematical formula. There are going to be people who are young who are going to wind up getting seriously ill.”  In addition, Fauci said it was critical for young people to understand that they can be a carrier for the virus and spread it without showing symptoms or feeling ill themselves.  “Even though you don't get seriously ill, you could bring it to a person who would bring it to a person that would bring it to your grandfather, your grandmother, or your elderly relative,” he argued. “That's why everybody's got to take this seriously, even the young.” In appearances on every major Sunday morning talk show, Fauci preached the importance of practicing social distancing for containing the spread of coronavirus cases, which have exploded in the U.S. in recent weeks as well as other hot spots all over the globe, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.  He and other health officials have pleaded for people to hunker down in an attempt to blunt the spread and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. When asked about crowds still heading to restaurants and bars over the weekend, Fauci said that there was serious room for improvement. “I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars,” he said. “Whatever it takes to do that, that's what I would like to see.”  Some local governments and businesses have stepped up to attempt to force social separation, banning mass gatherings and slashing business hours. The issue was unavoidable over the weekend for scores of travelers who tried to rush back to the U.S. in the wake of a new travel ban by the administration, crowding airports across the country, which Fauci called “unfortunate” and “not what you like to see.”  But where social interaction is able to be avoided, Fauci said that sacrifices in people’s lifestyles are imperative to heading off a crisis the likes of which countries like Italy are grappling with. “Certainly it is conceivable that if we don't do that you could get as bad as Italy,” he warned. “But I don't think we're going there, if we do the kind of things that we're publicly saying we need to do. We need to be very serious about, for a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States. We have to just accept that if we want to do what's best for the American public.” ",'Everybody's got to take this seriously': Fauci warns against coronavirus indifference among young people ,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-young-people-130229,politico

But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin said, arguing the current market rout has disparate origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus isn't comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus."" Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment is the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill Congress approved earlier this month, and it would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and, as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small- and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship — there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how big of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushing back on the idea that relief measures under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2008 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, there are no such issues contributing to the market tumble, Mnuchin argued. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, via Sophocles to Albert Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran, to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad, and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. The Plague is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, in which plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only 5 at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from divine will and the rise of con men to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene in which blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short lived and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague epidemic of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extramarital liaisons who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, The Betrothed gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. The Last Man by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakened Athens in its war with Sparta and claimed the life of the city’s great statesman, Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparked a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey, tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to to kill themselves in bizarre ways. The race is on for scientists from the Wildfire task force to contain the alien micro-organism and understand why two very unlikely people appear to be immune.

"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination and staying in the race just to try to persuade Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential questions in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before but only after nomination by this party.” He called President Dwight D. Eisenhower the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisers, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most importantly, when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed on to platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on civil rights. On that issue, the compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for Dreamers—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for undocumented immigrants. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of Sanders supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: When and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, Delaware, not Burlington, Vermont.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac Corp., the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. But Fair Isaac, also known as FICO, confirmed the existence of the probe Sunday, saying it focuses on “potential exclusionary conduct."" “FICO intends to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice and looks forward to a constructive dialogue about the state of competition in our industry,” the company said in a statement. “FICO is confident the Department will conclude that it has not engaged in any exclusionary conduct.” The company noted that it is also involved in an antitrust suit brought by credit reporting agency TransUnion, which that company filed after Fair Isaac sued it for unpaid royalties. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by TransUnion and the other two large credit reporting agencies, Experian and Equifax. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump's favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of ""Fox & Friends"" scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  ""To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,"" co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump's administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus' rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature ""curvy couch"" of the ""Fox & Friends"" set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored ""the big plastic desk"" one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio's ""fish bowl area."" ""We're doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don't want to get infected and you don't want to spread infection,"" Doocy said. ""We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,"" Earhardt added. ""And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.""  The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. The on-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was ""actually the safest time to fly"" despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of ""overreacting"" to the coronavirus. ""It makes you wonder if there's a political reason for that,"" Falwell said. ""You know, impeachment didn't work, and the Mueller report didn't work, and Article 25 didn't work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.""",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico

"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and less than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  The president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower among those surveyed than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, by a margin of 49-44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus’ threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy” in the coronavirus.  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding group gatherings of more than 10 people, working or attending school from home whenever possible, and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico

"There’s an easy way to tell that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a bad deal on the bipartisan coronavirus response bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. It’s not the liberal complaints that she let the White House limit paid sick leave to about one-fifth of U.S. workers. It’s not the Republican complaints that the bill doesn’t provide tax relief and cash for businesses and individuals hurt by the pandemic. It’s not even the general consensus that this initial legislation will need to be followed up by a much more aggressive economic stimulus bill. No, the easy way to tell Pelosi negotiated a bad deal for Democrats is that she negotiated a deal at all—rather than dictating the terms and telling President Donald Trump to take them or leave them. The lesson of the last congressional response to an economic emergency, President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill, is that when a president desperately needs legislation to address a crisis, anyone with the power to stop him can decide what’s in it. When Obama took office, in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Democrats controlled the House and Senate as well. But they needed 60 votes to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and there were only 57 Democratic senators, which meant Obama had to recruit three Republicans to vote for a stimulus bill. In just his second week in office, his blunt-spoken chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had to pose a blunt-spoken question to Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania: Whaddya want? Specter’s ask was simple, and by Washington horse-trading standards, noble. He wanted $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Then he would vote for the Obama stimulus. “Are you f---ing kidding me?” Emanuel exploded. Emanuel assumed $10 billion-with-a-b was just Specter’s initial bid, a shock-tactic negotiating ploy. But Specter gruffly said no, that was his final offer, take it or leave it. “What the f--- does a vote cost around here?” Emanuel screamed. In Specter’s case, it cost precisely $10 billion. He understood that Obama needed his vote to fix the economy, so he held all the leverage. But today’s congressional Democrats don’t seem to understand that at all. Right now, after initially downplaying the threat of coronavirus, then bungling the response to the pandemic, then watching the swift demise of the bull market he had hailed as proof of his leadership, Trump absolutely needs congressional action to limit the public health disaster and mitigate the economic damage on his watch. House Democrats can pass whatever bill they want, and if Republicans aren’t willing to go along with it, another lesson of American crisis politics is that it’s Trump who will suffer the consequences. Some Democrats have fretted that they might suffer politically if they don’t help Trump clean up the mess, but the opposite happened in 2009. The Republican minority in the House unanimously refused to support Obama’s stimulus, even though the crisis had exploded on his Republican predecessor’s watch, and the very next year those same Republicans took back the majority in the House. In fact, the only Republican in Congress who paid a political price was Specter, who had to switch to the Democratic Party after a GOP backlash over his vote for Obama’s stimulus, and ended up losing his seat anyway. In 2020, Democrats are not acting like a party with that kind of leverage. Instead, Pelosi frantically hashed out a compromise on Friday over 13 phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accepted Democratic proposals to expand free COVID-19 testing and unemployment benefits, along with a modest boost in food aid for the poor, but made it clear that permanent legislation mandating universal sick leave was a “non-starter” for Republicans. Trump ratcheted up the pressure by complaining publicly that Democrats weren’t “giving enough” in the negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the House proposals as “an ideological wish list.” Ultimately, Democrats accepted a temporary mandate that only applies to companies smaller than 500 employees, and allows companies smaller than 50 employees to seek exemptions.  “Democrats preferred to have something rather than nothing,” a Democratic source explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That was the choice we faced.” That was not the choice Democrats faced. Unlike the Republicans in 2009, who only had a filibuster-proof minority in the Senate, they also have a majority in the House, where they could have attached anything they wanted to the must-pass coronavirus testing and dared Republicans to say no.  If the president was unwilling to approve measures to help contain a pandemic and limit the economic fallout because he didn’t want sick workers to be guaranteed paid leave, he could have explained that to the public. He’s the president, the head of state, the “I alone can fix it” guy. He’s the one who will be judged by the outcome of the crisis that he initially insisted was not a crisis, then declared was under control thanks to his leadership. After all, Obama was held responsible for an economic crisis that erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, and the party that fought his efforts to fix the crisis ended up taking back the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. The public doesn’t follow the details of legislation on Capitol Hill, but it blames presidents for bad outcomes. The public also tends to blame presidents for partisan paralysis, while giving them credit for bipartisan cooperation; that’s why McConnell understood he could make Obama look partisan by fighting him, even though Obama’s stimulus was stuffed with tax cuts and other Republican priorities. It is true that Democrats would be accused of trying to exploit the crisis if they tried to load up a coronavirus bill with unrelated priorities such as, say, a Green New Deal to fight the climate crisis—although it’s worth noting that Trump and McConnell have already accused them of trying to exploit the crisis just for trying to mandate sick leave during a pandemic. But they still have the leverage to shape legislation just about any way they want if they’re willing to take the heat. In 2009, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine used her leverage to demand that the Obama stimulus include a technical fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax that added $70 billion to the price tag while providing virtually no economic stimulus. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine insisted on stripping a school construction initiative out of Obama’s stimulus—along with, ironically, an $870 million line item for pandemic preparedness. The 57 Democrats in the Senate also had the power to extract concessions for their votes; Obama had wanted a stimulus without congressional earmarks, but Dick Durbin of Illinois managed to include one for a $1 billion carbon-capture plant that never ended up getting built. Setting aside the question of whether Democrats should try to exploit the leverage to advance long-term policy priorities, they can absolutely exploit their leverage to address the short-term crisis. If they think universal sick leave will help, they should demand universal sick leave. Meanwhile, with Louisiana and Georgia already postponing primaries over the virus, why shouldn’t Democrats attach provisions guaranteeing that Americans will be able to vote by mail in November? Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, doesn’t understand why the Democrats didn’t insist on provisions restoring congressional oversight powers to help them ride herd on the administration’s response to the virus, ensuring that Trump and his aides can no longer defy subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Again, if Trump thinks it’s so important to prevent Americans from voting by mail and preventing Congress from overseeing his administration that he would block measures to accelerate the pandemic testing that his own team has botched, he can try to convince the public. “House Democrats don’t have some leverage,” Hauser says. “They have complete leverage.” By giving Trump the emergency measures that he needs most without insisting on the worker protections that Democrats wanted most, Pelosi has sacrificed some of that leverage. She has also helped the president look like a bipartisan consensus-builder, while essentially confirming the GOP talking point that Democrats have a responsibility to meet Trump’s demands in order to avoid a partisan stalemate. In 2009, Republicans simply ignored all the pundits warning that they would pay a huge political price for refusing to help the first black president fix an economic mess he had inherited—and the pundits turned out to be wrong. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders argue that it’s their duty to help Trump save lives and jobs in 2020, even though Republicans didn’t help Obama in 2009, even though Trump routinely calls them traitors, even though an economic downturn could doom his reelection. They’re pro-government people; they’re not inclined to stand in the way of government action during a crisis. When the Great Recession was just getting started in January 2008, Pelosi negotiated a quick bipartisan stimulus bill with Bush’s Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, and within months Americans were receiving $1000 checks from the federal government. It’s an honorable approach, even though it also probably reduces Pelosi’s leverage. It’s hard to win a game of chicken when the other driver knows you’re committed to avoiding a crash. Once Trump signs this emergency response bill, he’ll start clamoring for a much larger economic stimulus bill loaded with tax cuts for airlines, cruise lines, his own hospitality industry and other Republican-friendly businesses, along with payroll tax cuts that can help get him reelected. And Democrats will find that many of the same Republicans who mocked the idea of using taxpayer dollars to stimulate the private economy as big government when Obama was in the White House—even though they had supported that bipartisan stimulus bill under Bush—will rediscover the attraction of Keynesian economics when it suits their party’s interests. Democrats will have to decide whether to meet Trump in the middle, or whether to risk the obstructionist label by holding out for what they want in a time of economic pain. They will also have to decide exactly what it is they want. Some of Obama’s top economists have publicly called for Congress to send checks to American citizens, which would help the economy and also Trump’s reelection prospects. Again, that’s honorable and responsible, especially since Trump is sure to denounce the Democrats as obstructionists no matter what happens, but it’s not clear it squares with Democratic rhetoric about the danger of Trump’s reelection, especially if they don’t get anything in exchange for helping to rescue the sinking Trump economy. In any case, Trump won’t be able to pass a stimulus bill without them. At a minimum, one thing they can demand for their cooperation is legislative assurance that economic stimulus can no longer be something that only happens routinely under Republican presidents. They should insist on more robust “automatic stabilizers” so that any time the economy craters, no matter who’s in the White House, Washington will automatically spend far more on food stamps, unemployment insurance and other aid to vulnerable families, and perhaps automatically roll back payroll taxes and other economic burdens. That way, members of Congress will no longer have the power to take the economy hostage during crises. For now, though, Democrats absolutely have that power. They need to choose their ransom wisely.",Pelosi Has Trump Over a Barrel,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-stimulus-132388,politico
"Much of American public life is at a standstill. But not the Democratic presidential race — not yet at least. While some future voting has been postponed due to the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus across the U.S., primaries in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois are still on for Tuesday. Polling places in Ohio, which was set to vote Tuesday, have been closed down by public health officials after the governor pushed to delay the primary amid the public health crisis. Despite that, think of the vote as Super Tuesday, Jr.: The 441 delegates up for grabs in the three states still voting today makes it the third-largest delegate haul on the calendar, behind only March 3 and the slate of primaries planned for April 28. But between the coronavirus beginning to ravage the nation, the unprecedented, widespread closures that have shuttered public spaces across the country and Joe Biden’s now-commanding lead over Bernie Sanders — in polls released on the eve of the March 17 contests, Biden holds double-digit leads across all four states — the primaries are flying below the radar for many Americans. Last week, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio rejected calls to postpone Tuesday’s primaries, saying that they would make accommodations, including extending early-voting hours, to prevent large crowds from gathering. But on Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a court in Columbus for a last-minute postponement of the primary. When the court refused, saying it was too late to postpone, the state’s health department ordered the polling places shuttered — despite a lack of clarity about how, or even if, voters might be able to cast ballots in the primary. The Ohio Supreme Court later effectively upheld the decision to close the polls. Here’s a state-by-state look at the map for Tuesday: Democrats are hoping that Tuesday’s presidential primary is the springboard to flipping Arizona in November. President Donald Trump won the state by just 4 points in 2016, and polls conducted there show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both competitive against Trump in the general election. Arizona will likely be the closest of the four states voting on Tuesday, according to pre-election polls. But Biden still holds a double-digit lead over Sanders in poll after poll — despite Sanders’ enduring, though not overwhelming, advantage among Latino voters. Clinton defeated Sanders in Arizona four years ago. 56 percent to 41 percent, and carried all nine of the state’s congressional districts. Polls suggest Biden is on pace for a similar victory, barring a surprise. The state is going ahead with its primary despite the coronavirus outbreak. Many voters cast their ballots by mail, but there is still significant disruption. In Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix and is home to roughly 60 percent of registered voters — most polling places are closed for safety reasons. Instead, the county is operating about 150 vote centers on Tuesday, where voters can cast their ballots regardless of where they live within the county. Bernie Sanders was blown out by Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 — and his prospects are no more promising in 2020. Polls show Joe Biden with a two- or three-to-one advantage over Sanders, whose lack of support from older Democrats makes him particularly ill-suited for a state that is a magnet for retirees from the eastern third of the nation. Moreover, Sanders’ advantage with Latino voters in other states doesn’t translate to Florida, where many Hispanics are either immigrants or descend from immigrants from Caribbean and Latin American countries whose leftist leaders they despise. Polls show Sanders, who has praised some of the actions of those authoritarian governments, trailing Biden among Hispanic voters in Florida. The state has shuttered and consolidated a number of polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak. The state Democratic Party on Monday identified 91 precincts that were closed after GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered elections officials not to house polling places in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. But DeSantis resisted calls to reschedule the presidential primaries. “We’re definitely voting,” he told reporters in Tallahassee last Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Polls close in virtually all of Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern — but remain open an hour later in portions of the Panhandle in the Central Time Zone. Bernie Sanders had the Democratic establishment on edge four years ago when he stormed out of Michigan victorious and nearly beat Hillary Clinton in her home state of Illinois a week later. But in 2020, neighboring Michigan delivered a 16-point rout for Biden and has deflated the Vermont senator’s campaign here. Mike Bloomberg had started to make inroads here but when he, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar folded their campaigns, most of their moderate supporters — and their donors — joined the Biden camp. Gov. J.B. Pritzker also delivered his endorsement to Biden on primary eve. A WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last week showed Biden leading Sanders by 20 percentage points among likely voters in Illinois. Sanders recently rallied in Chicago with Rep. Chuy Garcia and other local Latino officials to help shore up his support. But the cloud hanging over the Tuesday primary is the coronavirus outbreak. Schools have been ordered closed and polling stations are being moved out of senior centers as the number of cases tick up, so it’s unclear what voter turnout will look like. The saga of Ohio’s primary adds significant uncertainty to a race that otherwise seems one-sided. Biden led Sanders in the latest poll by 23 points — in a state Clinton carried by 13 points four years ago, winning all but 15 of the state’s 88 counties. Gov. Mike DeWine’s Monday night order closing the polling places came only about eight hours before they were set to open. DeWine said Secretary of State Frank LaRose would petition the courts “to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.” But it’s unclear how that opportunity would be extended, or when. The ambiguity extends beyond the presidential race. Ohio was set to hold all its primaries for the 2020 elections on Tuesday, including for Congress and state legislature.",How to watch Tuesday’s primaries like a pro,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-to-watch-tuesdays-primaries-133318,politico
"Bernie Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination is closing, but a quick exit is far from guaranteed — even if he gets wiped out Tuesday. From his debate posture to staffing moves to the “virtual rally” he convened Monday evening, the Vermont senator is signaling that he may not be ready to concede.  If Sanders remains in the race, it will be in part to keep his “political revolution” alive. According to people familiar with his thinking, Sanders will not only consider what’s best for his campaign, but also the progressive movement. Many of Sanders’ aides and allies also expect him to press onward after Tuesday. They see a benefit in amassing as many delegates as possible in order to influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention this summer — even if Sanders himself can’t win the nomination. “I think there’s a very good chance that he will stay in,” said Larry Cohen, chair of Our Revolution, a group founded by Sanders in 2016. “The number of delegates you have, the number of people on the platform committee is absolutely critical.” Notably, Sanders has staff in place for states that vote as late as April 28, according to a campaign adviser, including New York. Sanders’ aides have long thought that he would have a good shot in the Empire State, which is rich in delegates. Earlier this month, Sanders’ team announced it was opening five offices in Pennsylvania, a state seen by many local and state officials as Joe Biden’s second home. A former aide close to the Sanders campaign said that a senior staffer argued as recently as last week that there is still a path to victory even if Sanders suffers major losses Tuesday. “I think he’s in. Who is going to advise him to drop out?” the person said, adding that current aides can “work for whatever group Bernie starts next.” At Sunday’s debate, Sanders not only tried to push Biden’s agenda to the left, but also litigated his past votes extensively. When the former vice president offered him an olive branch by adopting a plan to make college free for families earning less than $125,000 annually, Sanders said it didn’t go far enough. “What I know about Sen. Sanders’ thought process and focus is, it’s all about representing the movement and leading what he initially called the political revolution,” said Kurt Ehrenberg, Sanders’ longtime political strategist in New Hampshire until last year. “And not letting down the people who have been with him all along. I think that’s the most important consideration for him.” The fact that states are postponing their primaries to combat the coronavirus outbreak could provide Sanders more incentive to stay in the race. Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, which had previously been scheduled to vote in March, April and May, respectively, have rescheduled their primaries. Party officials in Puerto Rico are in the process of requesting a delay.  If Puerto Rico reschedules its March 29 primary, it will be more than two weeks until the next regularly scheduled primaries.  At the same time, the pandemic and looming possibility of a recession — or even a full-fledged depression — could make it more likely that Sanders stays in because the stakes are so high. “In these very uncertain times, we need a president who is going to put the interests of everyday people over every other consideration — and that’s Bernie Sanders,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser. “How do we know that? Because that’s been his consistent life’s work.” If Sanders continues his bid after Tuesday, he will face an onslaught of pressure from establishment Democrats and even some progressives to drop out. Many are wary of a long, divisive primary after 2016, and eager to take on President Donald Trump with the benefit of a united party. Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement helped fuel Biden’s comeback victory in South Carolina, said on the day of the March 10 primaries that the Democratic National Committee should “shut this primary down” and cancel debates if the former vice president swept the races, which he went on to do. Sanders’ electoral prospects are bleak. Momentum — and the delegate count — have shifted to Biden, who looks poised to win another string of contests decisively on Tuesday. “I think it could be much, much more constructive if he gets out earlier,” said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders during his 2016 campaign. “He’s still going to have roughly 1,000 delegates going into the convention, and that’s all the leverage that you need to influence the platform.” But Sanders often doesn’t follow the unwritten rules of campaigning that other politicians abide by. When he had a heart attack last year — the kind of event that would force most candidates out of an election — he stayed in the race. He also declined to bow out of the 2016 primary even after it was mathematically impossible to win the nomination, instead successfully pushing for a more progressive party platform and major rule changes. And at the same time that Sanders faces pressure from mainstream Democrats to exit, many on the left are encouraging him to stay in. Some Sanders supporters still remember when Biden was badly down in the primary before South Carolina, and envision a turnaround for their own candidate. “My urging to the campaign has been, ‘We’ve got to play this out,’” said Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles city councilman and prominent Sanders ally. “We’ve got to play the whole game … I’m suggesting we don’t quit simply because now they’re up. Why should we?” Progressive activists see Sanders’ continued candidacy as significant to their movement, even if his chances narrow to almost impossible margins. Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the political action committee Democracy for America, said there is a “real question” about whether either Biden or Sanders can reach the delegate threshold necessary to secure the nomination outright and that the tumultuous nature of the race suggests Sanders should stay in. “I don’t think anyone can predict for sure what’s going to happen between now and the end of this primary contest,” he said. “There’s plenty of time, plenty of delegates left, and this game can change at any minute.” The Democratic Party, he said, “shouldn’t be about shutting it down” before more states vote. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to remain in the race through at least March. “Not only should Bernie stay in, but it would actively hurt Democrats’ chances against Trump if he got out prematurely,” he said. “Because especially during this crisis, we need to know that our candidate is tested and stands for bold ideas like paid sick leave, free universal health care and canceling student debt as the right way to put money into the economy.” At the same time, Sanders loathes Trump and considers Biden a friend, which will also likely factor into his decision of whether to continue his bid for the White House after Tuesday. One thing is certain: Only Sanders and his wife, Jane, who has played an instrumental role in his 2020 operation, know for sure if he will carry onward. “All of the important decisions come from Bernie and Jane, as they should,” said Ehrenberg.",‘Who is going to advise him to drop out?’: Bernie may not be ready for quick exit,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-sanders-not-going-quietly-132641,politico
"For the second time in two years, Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the last members of a dwindling breed of conservative House Democrats who oppose abortion rights — is at risk of losing his seat in a primary. The Illinois lawmaker faces a rematch Tuesday against Marie Newman, a progressive upstart who nearly unseated him in 2018. But what should have been the left’s clearest shot yet at the incumbent is mired in uncertainty, with high-profile progressives distracted by Sen. Bernie Sanders's floundering presidential campaign and the election itself enveloped by the coronavirus crisis. Both camps are at a loss for how to handicap the race. “I personally don’t know,” said Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster working with Lipinski. “You love to say you’re a guru about these things, but there’s too many things we don’t know the answer to.” Lipinski is liberals' highest-profile 2020 primary target. Lining up behind Newman are Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and the Justice Democrats.  Ousting him would be a much-needed victory for these progressives who have struggled to recapture the magic of 2018, including Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of a leading House Democrat, amid a series of roadblocks throughout the primary season. Their latest loss came on Super Tuesday, when Jessica Cisneros, a liberal challenger boosted by the Justice Democrats, failed to oust a moderate Democrat in South Texas. Other progressive Senate candidates also fell short in primaries in Texas and North Carolina. Lipinski's primary may have been their best chance for victory— before the coronavirus outbreak. Newman began March with clear momentum: She was outspending the incumbent on TV by a two-to-one margin, and Lipinski supporters were nervous enough that they had begun urging Republican-leaning voters to pull a Democratic ballot and cast it for the incumbent. The biggest question mark now is turnout. Both campaigns are operating under the assumption that it could be at a historic low, with leaders, including Illinois' governor, urging citizens to be cautious about venturing out into public spaces. Lipinski admitted in an interview last week he was combating a lot of unknowns. “We’ll see where the presidential primary is,” he told reporters in the Capitol. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, don’t know what the coronavirus — what impact that could have. So, just wait and see.” The Newman campaign has urged supporters to vote early, is prioritizing phone banking and canceled its election night party. Both teams could make a plausible case that low turnout is to their benefit, depending on the age and ideology of who shows up. Lipinski’s team thinks he could have an edge with older voters, who tend to be more reliable and may be more likely to go to the polls. Yet the coronavirus disproportionately affects those 60 and older and public health officials urged that demographic should remain in their homes as much as possible. Other liberal challengers, such Ocasio-Cortez, have won low-turnout races where the electorate is smaller and more ideological. The 2018 midterms brought roughly presidential-level primary turnout, and Newman came within 2,200 votes short of ousting Lipinski. Though a new policy by the House Democratic campaign arm that blacklists consultants who work with primary challengers cost her some top campaign talent, Newman said she feels better prepared this cycle. “As you can imagine, your first time out you learn a lot. And I did. And there’s things that I didn’t do well,"" she told reporters in a phone call last week.  Now ""we have an amazing voter outreach program,"" she said. ""I started fundraising a lot earlier this time.” Her campaign, she said, has knocked over 110,000 doors and made 90,000 phone calls. She had outraised Lipinski by more than $400,000 as of late February, and that contrast is particularly stark on television. Newman has funneled about $900,000 on television advertising, while Lipinski has dropped less than $450,000, according to an analysis obtained by POLITICO. Plus a coalition of pro-abortion-rights groups, including EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice and Planned Parenthood, have dropped about $1 million in TV ads knocking Lipinski. And outside allies who spent for Lipinski in 2018, such as the bipartisan group No Labels, have largely stayed out this cycle, leaving a stark disparity. “She’s got significantly more independent-expenditure resources than she had last time, and we have significantly less,” said Dave Heller, a media consultant for Lipinski, “which is the only reason why we’re worried.” Lipinski is reviled by the liberal wing of the party for a slew of positions and votes that range from defunding Planned Parenthood, to his 2010 opposition to the Affordable Care Act. (He is now notably running an ad touting his efforts to protect that law, attacking Newman for supporting a single-payer health care plan.) Still, Newman has centered her campaign more squarely around other issues like reducing gun violence and making health care affordable. She supports Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal. Lipinski has pitched himself as more in line with the district and suggests Newman is too extreme: ""We should remain focused on what’s important. What really holds us all together as Democrats: the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress."" Yet there’s evidence to suggest his allies are leaning on independent and Republican voters to boost him in the Democratic primary. An internal campaign strategy document accidentally leaked in November suggested “GOP surrogates” could help Lipinski court Republican voters. Then this weekend, a Newman volunteer received what appeared to be an automated text message mobilizing GOP-leaning voters to ""stop"" Newman and Cook County (Ill.) prosecutor Kim Foxx. Asked last week about the possibility of courting Republican voters — Illinois doesn't have party registration, so voters can pull whichever party's primary ballot they request — Lipinski said it was not the focus of his outreach but suggested he would take their support. “I think it’s good to have more people vote in the Democratic primary, bring them into the Democratic Party,” he said. Lipinski was first elected in 2004, after his father, then-Rep. Bill Lipinski, announced his surprise retirement and persuaded the state Democratic Party to nominate his son to replace him on that fall's ballot. The younger Lipinski could benefit from Chicago machine politics that boosted him and his father in the past. He will need to run up the margins in the Chicago part of the district, as he did two years ago, while Newman is banking on support in the southwest suburbs. A win by Newman on Tuesday would bring a surge of energy to progressives disheartened by a stinging loss earlier this month against Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who has also opposed abortion rights.  Cuellar and his fellow moderates have hailed his victory over Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, as an indicator that their caucus is still a big-tent party. “It bodes well for moderates and centrists,” said Cuellar, who said he had discussed his race with Lipinski. “A lot of members were very happy I won because they felt that, if I would have lost, then that would have created a momentum.” Sanders’ dismal performance in recent primaries has relieved some Lipinski supporters, who worried Sanders could drive out young and more left-leaning voters out to the polls, and that they would be more likely to support Newman. Interviewed last week at the Capitol as the House scrambled to cobble together a program to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, some top progressives suggested they had not been closely monitoring Lipinksi’s race or were otherwise preoccupied. ""Obviously, I’ve been very busy with the Sanders campaign,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a top Sanders surrogate. “But I’m supportive of her; we did some fundraising for her.” “I don’t know any of the day-to-day detail stuff,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Newman, when asked if he was following the race. The scaling back of large gatherings precluded any kind of final-weekend rally with big-name headliners like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez — though it’s not clear if any would have materialized without the outbreak. Neither campaigned for Cisneros in South Texas. “I was always a little bit worried about this dynamic,” said Sean McElwee, the founder of a liberal think tank. “The extent to which the top of the ticket was going to swamp out interest in the down-ticket stuff was always a danger for these primary challengers this cycle.”","This anti-abortion rights, Obamacare-opposing House Democrat is in trouble",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/dan-lipinski-primary-133226,politico

"The return of the snowbird is a sign of spring in Canada — though this year, those returning from states with coronavirus cases are causing concern rather than celebration. Hundreds of thousands of retired Canadians spend their winters in warm American climes, timing their return with the melt of the snow back home. Heightened concerns about the rapid spread of COVID-19 are prompting Canadian officials to openly question whether the travelers may bring home more than memories and souvenirs. It's unclear if border agents are prepared to manage their arrival or if the travelers know about the self-quarantine precautions they’re supposed to take when they get to Canada.  Many of those “snowbirds” live part of the year in Florida, which has seen a stark increase in the number of diagnoses and at least 141 positive cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that’s spread across the globe. Those retirees are among the most vulnerable populations affected by the upper respiratory disease. With rising concern about the outbreak, politicians and health officials are wondering aloud how they'll handle the influx as cases of the virus continue to rise in the country. Ontario Chief Medical Officer David Williams said Monday that the province was “trying to get some direction from the federal government” on how to manage the snowbirds' return. “We’re seeing a number of Ontarians at least coming back in ever-increasing numbers,” he said. “Unfortunately, a number of them, after a few days, have been found to be positive from different parts of the USA.” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Sunday he's instructed the province's tourism arm to redirect advertising toward Canadians, including snowbirds, to inform them of the new protocols upon arrival in the country from abroad. Just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was appealing for Canadians abroad to return home as soon as possible, many of these older citizens were notified by their medical insurers that their coverage for COVID-19 will expire in the next week if they remain away. Trudeau said Monday that anyone showing symptoms associated with the illness won't be permitted to board flights to Canada beginning Wednesday, adding another potential complication to anyone trying to leave the U.S. Evan Rachkovsky, a spokesperson for the Canadian Snowbird Association, said his group has emailed more than 100,000 members with up-to-date information on Canadian government recommendations, including that they will be expected to self-isolate upon return. “We are doing everything that we can do to flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus,” Rachkovsky said when asked how members were receiving the instructions, adding that the group has been providing the details about self-isolation for more than a week. “The response has been positive in the sense that ... they’re obviously being cautious, and they want to return home as quickly as possible,” he said. He did not have information on whether any members have tested positive for the virus. The Canada Border Services Agency announced new coronavirus screening questions Monday after being criticized for an apparently haphazard approach to evaluating inbound travelers for possible symptoms and to advising them on the strongly encouraged 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said every Canadian returning home — including snowbirds arriving by car — will receive information telling them to self-isolate. “People who ... maybe spent the winter down in Florida or in Arizona, many of them will be driving back,” he said Monday. “That same information will be provided to them as they cross into Canada ensuring that they understand the need to self-isolate for 14 days.” Florida and Arizona are the most popular states among snowbirds, Rachkovsky said. St. Petersburg and Clearwater boast “several thousand” Canadians come wintertime, and many also flock to the Phoenix and Mesa areas of Arizona, he said. It’s difficult to estimate how many snowbirds will return to Canada in the coming days, Rachkovsky said. “But you’re definitely dealing with hundreds of thousands of people"" who are being asked to leave as quickly as possible, he added.",Return of Canada's 'snowbirds' raises COVID-19 concerns,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/canada-snowbird-coronavirus-133062,politico
"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Cafecito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico
"The voice of the woman, introducing herself as “Elisabeth … you know, Poldi’s mom,” sounded genuinely concerned. A friend of hers, who was a doctor at the university hospital of Vienna, had called her with a warning, she said in German. The clinic had noticed that most patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus pandemic, had taken the painkiller ibuprofen before they were hospitalized. Tests run by the university’s laboratory, she added, had found “strong evidence that ibuprofen accelerates the multiplication of the virus.” With lightning speed, an audio recording of the message spread among German-language users of WhatsApp, the messenger service owned by Facebook. Quickly, similar recordings referring to alleged research from Vienna in other languages like Slovak also began circulating on the service. But the WhatsApp message was based on fake information. “Nonsense,” said Johannes Angerer, a spokesperson for the Medical University of Vienna. “We neither discussed this internally, nor do we conduct any research into the potential effects of ibuprofen on COVID-19.” While there have been warnings against the use of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen to treat coronavirus-like symptoms, including by France’s health minister, everything the voice recording said about research efforts at the medical school had been made up, he stressed. The university released statements to flag the messages as fake within hours after first hearing about them Saturday morning. But the proverbial horse had bolted: German-language Google searches for the keywords “ibuprofen” and “Corona” spiked on Saturday around noon, according to data from the search giant. Over the weekend, the university’s website collapsed temporarily. The case provides an example of how, as the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, a wildfire of false and unverified information about the pandemic is following in its wake. On private messaging services like WhatsApp, well-intentioned but fearful individuals are forwarding messages with misleading or doctored information. Other cases range from warnings over made-up extraordinary measures governments might take to keep people in their homes to false numbers of deaths and the level of preparedness of medical services. “We are aware of an increasing number of false information about the COVID-19 outbreak appearing in public discourse, including on social media,” European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová, whose portfolio includes the EU’s efforts to fight fake news, told POLITICO in an email. But she also acknowledged that “we need to understand better the risks related to communication on end-to-end encryption services.” The Vienna fake is far from an isolated case of such digital misinformation — and others often follow a similar pattern that involves people claiming to share insider information with friends and family that they’ve gained access to. Among Belgian WhatsApp users, an audio message has been circulating with a woman claiming the hospital she worked in had triggered “the maximum pandemic plan.” Other voice recordings warned people of a complete lockdown of the country and urged them to stock up on food. Poland was hit by a wave of rumors about the government introducing zoning to cities and cutting off transportation to Warsaw. One audio message, recorded by a man who claimed he had a journalist friend with close ties to political decision-makers, said that as of last Sunday, the president would introduce an “emergency state” and that people wouldn’t be able to leave their houses for three weeks. In France, users forwarded an audio message of a woman who said that she has “a very very very well placed uncle” with ties to national ministers from whom she got information that the whole country would soon be in full quarantine. And in Portugal, a widely circulated voice message suggested that information on the number of infected people in the country was downplayed by official sources, with a man saying: “Forget the numbers the television is talking about. There are thousands of infected in Portugal, confirmed.” In Ireland, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar pleaded with people on Twitter: “I am urging everyone to please stop sharing unverified info on What’sApp groups. These messages are scaring and confusing people and causing real damage.” Jourová, who is drafting new proposals on how to protect EU democracies from misinformation, warned that her office was “concerned that some [false claims] can lead to public harm, such as false claims that drinking bleach cures the virus, or abuse the situation for material gain.” Her office is “is in regular contact with online platforms” to address the issue, she added. Experts have warned that, as Facebook has clamped down on misinformation on its main platform, its messenger service WhatsApp, which was bought in 2014, is increasingly becoming a key arena for the spread of misinformation. The social networking giant has invested millions of euros to clamp down on falsehoods on its main network, so people have turned to WhatsApp because it is less regulated and allows people to share personal messages with large numbers of people. In a statement, the company said that it is “committed to doing our part to tackle viral messages,” among other things by “reducing the number of people you can forward a message to.” In recent years, Facebook has limited the ability of people to forward WhatsApp messages in an attempt to stop misinformation from spreading like wildfire, and has teamed up with governments to help them share official announcements on the platform. “We encourage all users to check the facts online before sharing messages that have been forwarded to them, and we encourage users to engage directly with trusted and official sources for important information,” a company spokesperson added. Still, the rise of WhatsApp represents the latest turn in the cat-and-mouse game between those spreading misinformation — often people who are doing so unwittingly — and the global platform’s ability to thwart such activities. For Claire Wardle, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who has tracked WhatsApp’s role in spreading falsehoods, the platform allows people to share personal details — something many are eager to do in a time of crisis. “So much of this is about emotion, and audio is an emotive medium,” she said. “That phenomenon, which dates back to what we saw in India, is finally coming to Western Europe. People are turning to WhatsApp because they have more to say, and they want to speak directly to their friends and family.”", The coronavirus fake news pandemic sweeping WhatsApp,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-fake-news-pandemic-133447,politico
"Before markets started spiraling like 1987’s “Black Monday” crash, and even before President Donald Trump heard from state governors and G-7 leaders trying to stave off deaths at home, the president received a series of fresh warnings about the scale of the calamity poised to wash over America.  His coronavirus task force presented new information based on overseas models showing how quickly the virus could spread without swift action. And new data he was shown from China overnight highlighted that country’s economic collapse — plunging factory activity and soaring unemployment — despite its draconian measures to combat the coronavirus crisis.  Faced with a reality that the nation he oversees needs to take dramatic action or follow in the footsteps of deeply troubled nations abroad, the president took on a newly somber tone about a virus outbreak he spent months downplaying.  “I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing,” Trump quipped as he stepped up to the lectern in an unscheduled appearance at the sparsely populated James S. Brady briefing room in the White House, where reporters were arranged with open seats between them. It was a short moment of levity for Trump before he laid out dramatic new guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the virus and saving lives. He instructed people to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, stay home from work or school if possible, avoid travel and nursing homes.  In just 24 hours, the president went from telling people filling up their pantries to just “relax,” to acknowledging the economy might be careening toward a recession and warning the public they have a narrow window of 15 days to stop the spread of a lethal disease. “It’s bad. It’s bad,” Trump said. “But we’re going to be hopefully a best case, not a worst case. And that’s what we’re working for.” It was a dramatic change in tone from his Oval Office address, which was riddled with mistakes; his Rose Garden news conference, where he went against expert recommendations and shook hands with everyone in sight; and his Sunday appearance with the vice president, when he rattled off a list of CEOs he talked to on the phone only to turn on his heels without taking questions. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play,” Trump said Monday, flanked by members of his task force. “If everyone makes these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus.” The shift represented a new understanding by the White House of the risk that the U.S. could soon be overwhelmed by a disease explosion.  “Look, we could have a spike in these cases or we could blunt the curve,” national security adviser Robert O’Brien told POLITICO. “And if we can blunt the curve we can end up with a situation where our health care system can handle the crisis. We don’t want a spike the way we’ve seen in Italy.” The president, who just one day before said the virus would quickly pass, said Americans should brace for the coronavirus to affect daily lives as late as July or August. And he appeared disturbed to hear that some of his closest allies, like GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, had bucked the advice of the health professionals standing at his side by encouraging people to go to restaurants. “Well, I would disagree with it,” Trump said. “It's adverse to what the professionals are saying.” Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer called it a “striking difference.”  “This was sobering, serious, realistic and modest. This is what the doctor ordered,” Fleischer said. The 180-degree turn came after Trump was urged by allies privately and publicly to do more as the crisis careened out of control.  Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an outside adviser to Trump, penned an op-ed in The New York Times on Monday that didn’t criticize the president but did push him to act more aggressively by directing governors to close all schools and prohibit attendance at public facilities, including restaurants and bars, until at least May 11, among other suggestions.  “More must be done to prepare for increasing case numbers and to effectively communicate what must be done to reduce the threat,” he wrote. “I fear Americans are not yet taking this virus seriously enough.” And Newt Gingrich, another ally of the president, whose wife is the ambassador to the Holy See in Vatican City, wrote a chilling first-person account of what he saw in Italy.  “Faced with a pandemic threat, history teaches us it is far better to be overprepared than underprepared,” Gingrich wrote in Newsweek. “The lesson of Italy is that the sooner you act, the fewer lives you will lose and the less damage you will do to your economy.” On Sunday, the president hoped that the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its target interest rate to near zero would help blunt the market’s nosedive and for once lavished praise on an institution he regularly lambastes on Twitter. “That makes me very happy,” he said in a news conference.  But a former adviser said Trump realized Monday when the financial markets continued to fall that he had to do more. “The Fed obviously didn’t help” calm the waters, the person said. Trump was also deeply alarmed by the economic collapse in China that became apparent early Monday, according to two people close to the White House. Data released late Sunday showed a 13.5 percent decline in China’s industrial output in January and February from a year earlier, as well as a dramatic spike in unemployment. The country has also experienced a widespread suspension of manufacturing since the coronavirus outbreak began in China’s Hubei province in December.  “The president understands numbers and they were explaining to him some of the China economic numbers over the weekend and now he knows what’s coming here,” said one person close to Trump, adding that the drop in manufacturing truly startled the president. “This is a communist country that sealed off everyone in their apartments and is still seeing those numbers, so it made him realize there’s no way for the U.S. not to suffer those consequences and what he needs to do is whatever he can to get us through this as quickly as possible,” the person added.  News of China’s economic free fall came just days after the president and his team boasted about gains in U.S. markets following his declaration of a national emergency — during the Rose Garden ceremony last Friday at which Trump surrounded himself with corporate executives.  Up until Saturday, officials inside the White House Office of Legislative Affairs were “trying to project as much confidence” as possible in their conversations with the president, a tone that began to shift Sunday morning as more governors implemented lockdowns on non-essential businesses and ordered their residents to avoid gatherings of 50 people or more.  “It’s smart what he’s done. He’s made a decision to downplay expectations,” said a second person close to the White House after watching Trump’s appearance at the White House briefing Monday afternoon. Another official noted that the new White House guidelines gave some governors political cover to call for curfews and closures that have been met with groans by some small businesses bearing the brunt of the new rules or eye-rolls from younger Americans who may be less susceptible to the physical damage of the virus.  “I think the media has to recognize why he was hired by the American people — he’s not going to be consoler-in-chief,” said Jason Miller, a senior adviser on Trump’s 2016 campaign and an unofficial adviser. “They want him to go and get it done. What he’s realized here from the markets to society … they react to big bold leadership.” Fleischer said the president was able this time to be “reassuring and realistic.” “When events are this big, this serious, and this scary, the president’s communications job is twofold: One, be reassuring. And two, be realistic. And those two reinforce each other. The more realistic a president is, the more a country will believe his reassurances.” Still, Trump didn’t let go of his old approach completely.  When asked by a reporter Monday to rate his response on a scale of 1 to 10, the president answered in Trumpian fashion: “I’d rate it a 10. I think we’ve done a great job.”",A chastened Trump presents a newly somber tone,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-133278,politico
"Even before Congress has finished work on a second stimulus bill to deal with the coronavirus crisis, senators from both parties and the White House are already talking about a third package, which will come with a price tag that runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  And few people, from President Donald Trump on down, are complaining about the cost — knowing the country faces a potentially unprecedented economic hit from the pandemic.  But perhaps the most shocking fact is that the normally slow-moving Senate could pass the “Phase 3” bill this week, according to several GOP senators.  Following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, acting budget chief Russ Vought, and White House legislative affairs Director Eric Ueland, Senate Republicans said the Trump administration will present them with proposals on Tuesday for the latest response to the economic calamity caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  GOP senators said Mnuchin wants to funnel money to small businesses hit by the crisis, perhaps tens of billions of dollars.  And the U.S. airline industry, which has taken a huge hit as passengers disappear, could also get some financial help from the federal government. While the administration doesn't want to call it a bailout, the airline industry has warned that some carriers may face a ""potential valley of death"" if action isn’t taken quickly. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other top Democrats will roll out their own $750 billion-plus package on Tuesday, and what Trump and Senate Republicans will propose may equal or top that.  “I’m not going to comment on the specific numbers right now. I’ll be talking to the Republicans at lunch tomorrow. But it’s a big number,” Mnuchin said after huddling with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans for more than an hour in the Capitol on Monday.  “And we’ll be looking for support for small and medium-sized businesses, we’ll be looking for support for certain industries that we’ve talked about that are particularly hard hit. I’ve talked about airlines, hotels, others. And we will be looking at a general stimulus.”  “The president has instructed his team to look very expansively at what we have to do, and not be impeded by the potential price tag for what’s necessary here,” Ueland added.  A multibillion-dollar measure crafted by Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi to provide some paid sick leave, expand free coronavirus testing, and boost food aid and unemployment insurance is expected to be taken up in the Senate as early as Tuesday. Congress already passed an $8.3 billion bill to combat the virus. Mnuchin is supposed to attend a Senate GOP luncheon on Tuesday and offer specific proposals for the next piece of congressional action.  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who attended the session with Mnuchin and other administration officials, said the Senate could move to a new rescue package as early as this week. In fact, Rubio said many senators made it clear they want to move ahead on that drastically accelerated timeline. “I don’t think we can assume that we can keep reconvening the Senate every week like we did this week. I don’t think we can make that assumption,” Rubio said. “With what might happen to airlines or travel schedules, with individual members having to go into quarantine or being exposed — I don’t think we can operate as if we can just bring the Senate and House back whenever we want.”  McConnell’s office wouldn’t comment on the possibility of passing the Phase 3 bill, although a Senate GOP aide noted, “The discussions are too premature to say at this point. But now that FISA is out of the way, it opens up more floor space for possible consideration.” Ueland also noted that Trump wants quick action as well.  “We can’t let weeks and months get under our feet here,” Ueland said. “Again, we have a real focus on urgent action, and I’m hopeful there could be swift consideration of consensus ideas as quickly as possible.”  Senators in both parties acknowledged they were concerned about the current government deficit, which was already projected to be more than $1 trillion before the coronavirus hit and derailed the economy.  But now, they point out that only the federal government can respond to this emergency with the financial power needed to address the present emergency.  “The reason having a massive deficit is a problem is that in a crisis, only the federal government can frankly provide support to state and local governments that have to balance their budgets,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).  Senate Democrats blamed the 2017 GOP tax cut — engineered by Mnuchin, McConnell and other Republican leaders — for the huge deficit, yet warned it shouldn’t matter now.  “We wouldn’t have that trillion-dollar deficit if we didn’t do a totally unnecessary tax cut,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). “But if we go into a recession or a depression, we’re talking trillions of dollars there.”  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a deficit hawk, said he would offer an amendment to cut spending from other programs for every dollar added in stimulus spending.  “I think that all spending should be offset by cutting less important spending, so I will offer an amendment to pay for it,” Paul said. “I think anytime we choose to spend money, no matter what the cause is, we should pay for it.”  Paul predicted such “pay for” amendments will be allowed because party leaders won’t want to get bogged down in a procedural fight that could disrupt quick action on the package.

"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the Washington primary, keeping a lead over fellow candidate and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the Associated Press. Washington was one of six states that voted last Tuesday — including Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota and Idaho — but was the last to have a winner declared Monday evening. Washington votes entirely by mail-in ballots.  Biden secured victories in all states except North Dakota, which went to Sanders. His Washington win continues a surge for the former vice president that initially started with a rocky trail behind Sanders.  Biden won by more than 21,000 of the over 2 million votes cast, according to the AP. Though 13 candidates were on the ballot, Biden and Sanders were the main candidates after a litany of prominent Democrats — including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — dropped out of the race. Sanders won the state's caucuses in 2016, beating out Hillary Clinton. Washington later had a non-binding primary that year that did not have an impact on the state's delegates, which Clinton won.

"As hospitals grapple with more coughing and feverish emergency-room visitors than they can test, the White House has deployed a SWAT team of fixers and technocrats to ramp up coronavirus testing, in an implicit acknowledgment that the Trump administration’s response has continued to fall short of what is needed. About 100 staffers and outside advisers, split between the health department and the White House, are currently working on teams to rapidly increase supplies of test kits and cope with shortages across the country, said four people with knowledge of the strategy. “This is the A-team of people who get shit done,” said one official, who’s worked with some of the staffers leading the effort. “We’ve got to show the American people that we can deliver on the testing promises” after weeks of President Donald Trump vowing that “anybody who needs a test can get a test” — a claim that doesn’t match the growing number of doctors, hospitals and patients who have said they’re still waiting for access and results. The lack of testing remains — despite Vice President Mike Pence’s assurance that drive-thru testing centers should be operative later this week — the greatest immediate danger to the U.S. response to the crisis, public health experts have warned. While Johns Hopkins University on Monday reported more than 4,287 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the United States, the true number could easily be more than 10 times higher at this point. That’s complicated medical professionals’ efforts to focus their resources and hurt public health officials’ effort to marshal a response. “We are far behind where we need to be,” tweeted Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, who changed his Twitter name to read ""Ashish 'We super duper need testing for COVID' Jha."" While the Harvard expert this weekend guessed that at least 40,000 people may be infected, ""we can't know without testing"" how big the problem is, he added. The SWAT-team effort is being overseen by Brett Giroir, the HHS official who was tapped as the nation’s testing coordinator on Friday, and Adam Boehler, a former HHS official who was drawn in to the coronavirus response last week. Brad Smith, a health-industry entrepreneur who only joined the administration in January, is serving as the operational leader. Outside experts in health care delivery and technology, like Flatiron Health CEO Nat Turner, also have been brought in as advisers. The officials have spent the past five days in round-the-clock war rooms and strategy sessions, gaming out ways to deploy drive-thru testing as Pence and Trump have promised this week. The initial testing centers will prioritize health workers and vulnerable populations, like people over 65, with a focus on the states that are hardest hit by the coronavirus. The new SWAT-team approach is similar to the emergency effort to repair HealthCare.gov in 2013, three officials said, although drew distinctions between the Obama-era recovery strategy — to fix the rollout of a long-scheduled website — and the frantic response to a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. “This shit hasn’t happened before,” said one senior administration official. “It’s not like we planned for coronavirus, and six months later we had a coronavirus.” Tapping officials like Giroir and Boehler, who have steered multiple administration priorities like President Donald Trump’s HIV/AIDS strategy and kidney-care overhaul, and a technocrat like Smith, is a tacit acknowledgment of management failures with the existing strategy, said two individuals, with the Trump administration cycling through multiple leaders and tactics — and officials trading blame for why testing has run so far behind. Much of the Trump administration’s initial strategy rested on coronavirus tests distributed by the Centers for Disease Control, which turned out to have manufacturing problems. CDC Director Robert Redfield has been widely faulted inside the administration for problems with his agency’s tests and miscommunicating to senior officials when replacement tests would be ready. HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who led the initial response, is frustrated with Redfield, said two people familiar with the situation, and dispatched Giroir earlier this month to the CDC to quietly investigate the problems within the agency, said three individuals briefed on the effort. The health secretary also elevated Giroir and another official, emergency-preparedness chief Robert Kadlec, to take over the department’s coronavirus response. Meanwhile, two officials blamed Azar himself for not doing more to coordinate the overall response across January and February, leaving the administration well short on the number of necessary tests. Some of the strategies taken in recent days, like working with private labs to ramp up tests, could have been pursued nearly two months ago under Azar’s leadership, the officials said. Vice President Mike Pence took over the response from Azar about three weeks ago, amid frustrations about the state of the effort and whether Azar's public health deputies had been too alarmist in their messages. But Pence has focused on coordinating the larger message and his office has lacked operational support to execute on specific initiatives, said two individuals. The new SWAT team is also a reflection of the growing involvement of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, in the administration's coronavirus response. Kushner is a longtime friend of Boehler, who led the Medicare innovation center until taking a new role as chief of U.S. international development finance chief last fall, and is viewed as an apolitical Silicon Valley veteran. Meanwhile, Smith is a Boehler ally who inherited his job at the Medicare innovation center before being pulled in to coordinate the SWAT team response. Asked about the shifting roles and responsibilities, an HHS spokesperson touted the decision to bring on more operational experts like Giroir. “The Trump Administration has activated a whole of government response to COVID-19 and all of our leaders bring highly valuable experience and expertise to this effort,” the spokesperson said. “The American people should know that the entire government is working around the clock to prepare for and protect against COVID-19.” The White House also defended the CDC’s role and response, despite problems with the agency’s tests that led to weeks of limited information about the spread of coronavirus. “CDC is doing what they could, given their tools and resources,” said Katie Miller, a spokesperson for Pence. “Given the increased demand, the administration is doing as much as to add additional capacity in an expedited manner.” The nation’s inadequate coronavirus testing has meant that the true scope of the problem is unknown. One doctor involved in the coronavirus response at a New York City-area hospital, who asked for confidentiality because the doctor did not have permission to speak to the media, said the facility has seen its coronavirus cases jump from just a handful of confirmed patients a week ago to more than a dozen as of Sunday, as more testing has come online. But the true scope of the outbreak still can't be measured, the doctor added, because patients who aren’t sick enough to be hospitalized aren’t getting tested, and the facility has been turning away dozens of less critically ill people who present with coronavirus symptoms, creating a “big gap” between official numbers and the disease’s likely spread. Crystal Lucas, a former state legislature candidate in Florida, told POLITICO that her 61-year-old mother-in-law went to the emergency room of Palms West Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla., on Friday with respiratory problems. Four hours later, she was admitted. “The nurse told us she hadn’t been tested because they didn’t have any test kits,” Lucas said. “She had an infectious disease doctor on her team when she was still in a regular hospital room. She was obviously suspected to have an infectious disease.” Palms West’s communications office did not respond to requests for comment. The patient, Vickie Schafer, is now in critical condition, Lucas said. She finally got a coronavirus test on Sunday evening and is awaiting the results. “Everything points to COVID and they treated it as if it wasn’t even on their radar,” said Lucas. “If we have this going on and this woman presents all the symptoms, why would we not act as if she is already positive?” If Schafer tests positive, it could indicate the virus has spread in Loxahatchee, the area of Palm Beach County where she lives. As of Monday evening, there were eight cases in the county, according to the state Department of Health’s website. In addition to worrying about her mother-in-law, Lucas said she worries about the doctors and nurses Schafer might have been exposed to the coronavirus between Friday and Sunday. And she worries about the patients those people might have come into contact with. Some hospital officials have said they would have developed their own coronavirus tests weeks ago but were told to stand down by officials at CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. “We were told two things,” said Alan Wells, medical director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s clinical laboratories. “One, that they were developing the testing and that CDC and states would be able to handle this. Two, that they were exercising authority to regulate which testing was approved.” Combined with other factors, including limited supplies, Wells’ team decided to shelve their potential coronavirus testing plan six weeks ago, but resumed work as the situation worsened and finally unveiled the tests on Saturday. Public health leaders, doctors and even Wall Street investors, are growing worried about the lack of transparency around the inadequate response. “Testing is getting there but with the virus doubling right now at minimum every seven days, each day of testing lost is a day that more people get sick,” Financial services firm Raymond James warned investors on Sunday night.

"TALLAHASSEE — Door knocking? Nope. Surrogate stops? Canceled. The bubbly? Corked. Even the candidates will be AWOL. Florida, a state famed for its weirdness, is preparing for one of its weirdest election days on Tuesday, when Democrats and Republicans will brave a pandemic to cast primary ballots for their presidential nominees. With two popular candidates on the ballot, Democrats were hoping to deliver a show of force against President Donald Trump with pumped-up turnout and lots of noise. Instead, they’ve had their mojo stolen by the coronavirus. Florida is a presidential election year crown jewel, a delegate-rich state that does double duty as the nation’s largest battleground. It’s expensive and difficult to flex institutional and infrastructure muscle in the state, which serves as a barometer of any campaign’s viability. Still, neither Joe Biden nor Bernie Sanders have campaigned here this year, and neither will be glad-handing Tuesday. Democratic get-out-the-vote operations are all but halted, and for the first time in memory there will be no Election Day parties. As the country hunkers down to avoid the coronavirus, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, on Monday made a push to postpone his state’s Tuesday primary, a plea a judge rejected late Monday. Illinois and Arizona, which also vote Tuesday, are at full speed. And in Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he’s not going to panic. “We’re definitely voting,” he said Saturday at a coronavirus briefing. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Besides, he said, most ballots probably have been cast in early voting already. And neither party’s primary, he noted, are going to be cliffhangers. Florida has a reputation for botched elections — from hanging chads in 2000 to a confusing recount in 2018 that led to the ouster of two South Florida election supervisors. This time around, polling places could present the biggest challenge. In an effort to protect elderly populations most at risk from the coronavirus, DeSantis has shut down voting sites at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Democrats are riled up. “We agree with the governor’s decision. We think it’s good policy to protect at-risk populations,” said Juan Peñalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party. “But there is no list of impacted voting locations. It’s information we want to help communicate to voters, but we were told by the governor’s office there is no list, and won’t be before Election Day.” So Peñalosa’s staff and volunteers are making their own list. They’ve reached out to all of the state’s 67 county election offices to find out where polling sites will be closed. “We are compiling a list and have already started communicating to impacted voters,” Peñalosa said. Then there’s the problem of staffing. Poll workers afraid of being exposed to the virus are dropping out. That’s on top of the election coinciding with spring break — many workers have begged off duty this year due to family obligations. Pasco County elections supervisor Brian Corley said he started “hemorrhaging” poll workers after a county resident tested positive for the coronavirus. “I can’t blame them,” Corley said. “A lot of them are senior citizens.” Corley said he’s lost 175 workers so far, and has turned to the local sheriff, schools and county government to find people to fill their spots. School resource officers from the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office will be among those reporting for duty on Tuesday, along with teachers and other county employees. “We can’t get to them fast enough,” Corley said. Still, election supervisors remain optimistic the day will go smoothly, in part because turnout won’t be that high. “We knew going in this was going to be challenging,” said Orange County Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles. And Corley said he’s doing the unthinkable — encouraging voters to not show up, especially if they’re sick or at risk. “If anyone is unsure, don’t go to the polls, as much as it pains me to say that,” Corley said. “Elections are wonderful, but this is a political party nominating contest.” Campaign operations also are improvising as the coronavirus creep sets in. Rather than emphasizing last-minute campaign and policy talking points, or feverishly ramping up their face-to-face ground game, campaigns are employing public-service-type announcements. Entire operations have gone virtual. Digital events have replaced rallies, in-person fundraising has been canceled, and election night parties just won’t happen. Because neither race is close — Biden has lapped Sanders in state polls and Trump has no serious challengers — any impact on the actual results will be minimal as Florida copes with its slice of a global pandemic. “Post South Carolina, when Biden surged in southern states, Florida experienced the same shift,” said Dan Newman, a Florida Democratic consultant who is unaligned in the presidential primary. “Basically, the race coalesced into Sanders and non-Sanders, and as a trusted national name, Biden was the beneficiary.” More than a million Florida Democrats already have voted by mail or at early voting locations, surpassing pre-primary day turnout in 2016, when 889,207 Democratic voters cast ballots. That year, Hillary Clinton was still fighting off Sanders, her primary rival. And even if Democratic turnout is low, it won’t give Republicans a valid reason to gloat, Newman said. “I don’t think turnout in a presidential primary with neither campaign particularly active, and in a state that’s functionally already decided, and in the middle of a global pandemic is predictive,” he said, “of much.”","Florida is weird.

"The early signals from the coronavirus crisis point to a scale of damage unseen in the modern U.S. economy: the potential for millions of jobs lost in a single month, a historic and sudden plunge in economic activity across the nation and a pace of sharp market swings not seen since the Great Depression. As the coronavirus outbreak ravages a paralyzed nation, Wall Street suffered another brutal bloodbath on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average diving around 13 percent in its worst percentage loss since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. A reading on business conditions in the New York area plunged a record 34.4 points to -21.5 in March, suggesting a recession is underway that could be sharp and deep as revenue quickly bleeds out of major industries from airlines to hotels, restaurants, bars and sports leagues. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the broadest gauge of U.S. companies, fell 12 percent. It has shed $6 trillion in value since peaking in February, slamming retirement accounts for millions of Americans in ways that could have psychological ripples for many months to come. The last time the S&P had three days of similar wild swings was 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression. The S&P is now only around 300 points away from wiping out all its gains since Donald Trump won the White House in November 2016. President Trump himself, one of the grandest boasters of the strength and resilience of markets and the American economy, appeared to capitulate on Monday with a more somber tone reflecting the immense magnitude of the challenge facing the nation. “We have an invisible enemy,” he said, acknowledging that the virus could push the U.S. into recession. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” Trump urged Americans not to gather in groups over 10 and to avoid bars, restaurants, food courts and other public spaces. The VIX, a gauge of fear and panic on Wall Street, hit 82.69 on Monday — bringing it to territory unseen since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008. Oil prices tanked 10 percent — after a severe plunge last week — as traders bet the virus will ignite a global recession that sharply reduces demand for fuel. The massive sell-offs have led to suggestions by market professionals that regulators may have to take dramatic steps seen during the Great Depression and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That could include shuttering Wall Street — perhaps for days — until more is known about the direction of the coronavirus spread in the United States and until Washington comes up with a massive, bipartisan policy response to shore up flagging industries and direct money straight into the pockets of American citizens losing work as they remain shuttered in their homes at the direction of the government officials. For now, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Jay Clayton pledged to keep markets open, despite the waves of panicked selling. “Markets should continue to function through times like this,” he told CNBC. Still, many traders expect that if the market plunges several more thousand points, and trips more circuit breakers that temporarily halt trading, the administration could be forced to simply shut Wall Street down. “With new measures being put in place by the hour, the federal government at some point will have to consider a modern version of the bank holiday imposed by the Roosevelt administration back in 1933,” RSM Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas wrote in a client note. “That four-day holiday was put into place to restore confidence in the banking and financial system. Perhaps the governing authority should consider a 10-business day holiday until Congress can act.” Wall Street analysts are already assessing the damage done to the economy thus far: stark and likely to get far worse, very quickly. “Movie box-office revenues are down more than 60 percent in data through March 15 and more than 70 percent relative to the average of recent years,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. “Broadway box office revenues were already down about 20 percent relative to trend in data through March 8, and are presumably set to be down essentially 100 percent after theaters closed last Thursday, a result we also expect to see for professional and college sports revenues.” Restaurant bookings were collapsing in many cities and may now plunge to zero. Streets are increasingly empty as citizens follow government warnings to slow the spread of the virus. The hope on the part of White House officials is not to avoid a sharp economic slowdown — they all know it is coming — but that the short-term pain from extreme measures will lead to a flattening in the curve of the virus spread. Then economic activity can be made up when the crisis ebbs. But that will require agreement on a massive package of aid for both individuals and corporations to stave off mass bankruptcies and waves of layoffs. The White House hopes for a V-shaped economic cycle this time: a recession in which growth plunges then sharply recovers as consumers emerge from their bunkers with jobs to go to and money to spend. Kevin Hassett, the former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman who remains in contact with Trump and the White House, said in an interview that jobs reports for March and April could show horrific numbers that will force massive congressional action if it has not already occurred by then. He predicted losses of perhaps over 1 million jobs in coming reports and a spike in the jobless rate. “We really could see the worst jobs reports we’ve ever seen in our history.” Hassett said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter. (Goldman Sachs economists also predicted a drop of around 5 percent in economic growth in the second quarter.) And he noted that infighting between the House and Senate and uncertainty about the next stimulus package from the White House could make matters far worse. The White House is trying to settle on a package that would include a payroll tax suspension and emergency lending facilities, including from the Federal Reserve, and other measures for impacted businesses that would stop short of direct cash “bailouts,” a politically toxic word since the bank rescues of 2008 and 2009. William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, suggested the United States is headed into what could be the first recession whose length and depth will be determined largely by how effectively Washington responds, both on the fiscal and public health fronts. “This will be first recession induced by public health policies, and the nature of those public health policies and their effectiveness accelerating the recovery from the virus. And that will determine the course of the depth of the recession.” Lee said he was certain the second quarter would show a contraction, but that multiple policies, most of which are currently under consideration, could prime the economy to bounce back. Those policies would include direct aid to corporations slammed by the virus, through loan forbearance and acceptance of late payments. He also suggested credit rating firms would have to take into account the impact of the virus when making ratings changes, including potentially crippling downgrades. On the consumer side, Lee said supplemental sick pay leave and extended benefits for laid-off workers would be critical along with payments to cover day care. “Our avenues for pushing this stuff out through negative income taxes for households can be easily done. The key thing as that as soon as people feel safe to go out, that they have money in their pockets and they go and spend it.” Lee said he did not believe in giving free money away to corporations, but that decisions would have to be made about which companies are simply mismanaged and which are suffering directly from the virus. “We have to be generous about getting money out. It’s really important to preserve the transport infrastructure. We can’t have airlines filing for bankruptcy.” Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist and IHS Markit, said in a note to clients that the spread of Covid-19 to the U.S. ""is causing a sharp contraction in spending on activities that involve travel and congregating in public.” His firm now expects a recession to start in the second quarter, delivering a peak-to-trough decline in GDP of 2.3 percent, with the jobless rate rising to 6 percent by mid-2021. Goldman Sachs analysts increased their expectations for stimulus action out of Washington. Their base case is to see stimulus worth 1 to 2 percent of GDP in both 2020 and 2021, or roughly $400 billion to $800 billion worth. White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Monday the administration was pursuing at least $800 billion in relief for an economy hit by the crisis. Steve Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president, said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal expected to come out of the White House and Treasury by the end of the week. Moore authored the proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point. But it’s on a fast-track. They want it by the end of the week,” Moore said. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Moore said his group suggested financing the payroll tax holiday by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decision about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Federal Reserve to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of existing assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “Trump listens to us. He seeks out our advice,” Moore said. “We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” “When the virus is contained, the economy will bounce back. But how long that will take and much damage is done to supply chains and the number of bankruptcies — we just don’t know. Every day this lasts compounds the economic damage.”",How ugly could it get?

"The nation's biggest banks, which were at the epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis, are facing a new set of daunting challenges with markets in turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic. While the lenders will probably be in no need of a multibillion-dollar bailout as they were back then, they’re dealing with stress from all sides as they’re pressured to help shield consumers, businesses and other financial firms from a wave of economic pain that has already begun to hit. Business debt is at record-high levels. Many consumers will struggle to repay bank loans if they face even one missed paycheck. And though lawmakers and regulators reined in some of the riskiest behavior at banks after the crisis, a lot of those same activities are still happening in other less-regulated companies that are financially connected to the large lenders. That means the banks will be tested on how well they’ve prepared for a global shock to the economy that no one saw coming. “The banks are not the problem right now,” said Karen Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics. But “they can only be fortresses for so long.” For their part, the megabanks are trying to project strength. In a March 11 meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said the financial system is “in sound shape, and we are here to help.” Bankers argue that they rely much less on debt to fund their operations and have much more cash on hand than they did during the crisis to help them keep lending during a downturn. Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and five other major banks said over the weekend that they'd stop buying back their own shares through June as they pledge to help struggling consumers and businesses. The largest banks have also successfully weathered the Federal Reserve’s so-called stress tests, which require them to show every year how they would manage risks under a hypothetical severe recession. The exercise was launched in 2009 in the depth of the crisis to help restore confidence in the banking system. But financial markets are already showing signs of strain, with stocks in recent weeks wiping out most of their huge gains since Trump's election and trading in U.S. government bond markets becoming irregular, a situation that prompted the Fed to inject piles of cash into funding markets. Troubles are also growing in the market for a type of short-term business debt known as commercial paper. One of the biggest risks that regulators like the Fed have been watching is the rise in loans to companies that are already highly indebted, as well as the volume of corporate bonds that are so risky that mutual funds may not be allowed to hold them. If a lot of companies start to default on their debt, it could blow back not only directly on banks, but also other lenders and investors that do business with them. “You’re going to have massive defaults as the economy turns down, and a massive amount of dumping of the worst debt as certain investment vehicles like mutual funds are getting out of it,” said Dennis Kelleher, who heads the financial regulation advocacy group Better Markets. “You put those two things together, and there is an enormous threat coming to all financial institutions, but particularly the biggest banks.” According to financial analytics firm Trepp, banks have diversified the sectors that they’re invested in, but have particular exposure to companies in real estate; about 10 percent of outstanding corporate loans at a surveyed group of large and medium-size banks were in that sector. Corporate debt could also grow. Companies like Boeing are reportedly drawing on existing lines of credit, while United Airlines is one of the coronavirus-hit businesses that has taken out a new secured loan to help weather decreased revenue. Lee Shaiman, executive director of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, said bundles of loans to highly indebted companies, known as collateralized loan obligations, aren’t at much risk from the industries that are being hardest hit, like energy and travel. “You don’t want to be Pollyanna-ish,” he said. “We’re in for a rough couple of weeks at least, but it’s very clear why we’re here, as opposed to the financial crisis where there were a lot of reasons and a lot of excesses.” Those CLOs are more transparent and more conservatively structured than the mortgage-backed securities that helped lead to the 2008 blowup, he said. Meanwhile, a lot of payments won’t even be due for years. Still, financial firms are connected to each other in ways that aren’t always clear, which will lead to an intense focus on how large indebted companies are faring. “This is a tinder box that the current regulators have told us is not of concern” for the broader financial system, said Sarah Bloom Raskin, former deputy Treasury secretary and onetime Fed board member. “We will see the extent to which their confidence is warranted.” Raskin also said banks need to be preparing to defer payments from small businesses and people who might be late on mortgage or credit card payments, something their regulators last week encouraged them to do. Some banks have already announced rate reductions on loans for vulnerable borrowers. “These are contributors to how long and deep this downturn is going to be,” she said.",Big banks brace for coronavirus-related onslaught,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/big-banks-coronavirus-onslaught-132997,politico
"The Justice Department is abandoning plans for a looming criminal trial focused on claims of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. With jury selection set to begin in just over two weeks, prosecutors asked a federal judge to permanently dismiss the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought two years ago against two Russian firms linked to a St. Petersburg businessman known as Putin's chef, Yevgeny Prigozhin. The move scuttles a trial that could have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump: a high-profile showcase of U.S. intelligence agencies' evidence that Russian trolls sought to stir up support for him in the 2016 presidential election while fighting against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee who oversaw the case, formally dismissed the charge against the two Russian firms Monday night. Prosecutors cited several reasons for the shift and were clearly defensive that Russia would portray the decision as proof that U.S. evidence of the alleged Russian tampering is weak. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea wrote. ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted. It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution,"" Demers and Shea added. They said the indictment would remain in place against Prigozhin and 12 other Russian nationals, as well as the company alleged to have coordinated the online rabble-rousing, the Internet Research Agency. Trump appeared to celebrate the dropping of the charges and the scuttling of the trial as more evidence of the flaws of Mueller's operation. Late Monday night, the president retweeted another user's comment about the developments: ""How embarrassing for Team Mueller."" A defense lawyer for the Russian company that may have surprised prosecutors by seeking a trial in the case, Eric Dubelier, said the prosecution suffered from ""fundamental problems"" from its outset. ""The purpose of this indictment was to make a political statement regarding the outcome of the 2016 election that was grossly overstated,"" said Dubelier, a partner with law firm Reed Smith.  ""In preparing for trial we had every intention to prevail given the problems with the government’s allegations. The government’s evidence was completely devoid of any information that could establish that the defendants knew what they were doing was in violation of highly complex U.S. laws and regulations. This was a make-believe charge to fit the facts solely for political purposes,"" he added. One reason prosecutors cited for their retreat was a recent “classification determination bearing on the evidence the government properly gathered during the investigation [which] limits the unclassified proof now available to the government at trial.” The public filing offered scant details, but suggested that someone in the U.S. intelligence apparatus had decided that disclosing some of the evidence against Concord would expose U.S. intelligence capabilities. Prosecutors asked to submit a separate, secret, classified filing to the court that explained those concerns in more detail. While prosecutors were not specific in their public filing, one disclosed at a recent court hearing that the Justice Department planned to introduce a mystery witness who they said would implicate Prigozhin in election interference outside Russia. It is unclear whether that person is an intelligence asset, defector or someone else.  Intelligence officials also may have concluded that revealing certain evidence against Concord could put at risk Russians who helped the U.S. conclude that the 2016 activities were directed by the Kremlin. One such Russian with Kremlin ties was housed by the CIA in the Washington suburbs until his identity became public last year.  The Justice Department also filed a criminal case last month that suggested the Russian government was seeking to closely monitor Russians cooperating with U.S. intelligence agencies.  From the outset, supporters of the Russian trolls' prosecution — and some critics of the effort — dubbed it a ""name and shame"" effort aimed more at seizing the public relations value of an indictment and less at the typical goal of bringing criminals to justice. No trial ever seemed likely unless one of the defendants stumbled into a place where they could be arrested. However, soon after the indictment was returned in February 2018, Prigozhin sought to call the American prosecutors' bluff without ever exposing himself to the risk of prison. One of his firms, Concord Management & Consulting, hired U.S. lawyers to fight the case. So, the U.S. found itself facing a trial without ever having a human defendant in the dock. That prospect has been relatively clear for nearly two years, but it took prosecutors until Monday — amid the national panic over coronavirus — to concede that going to the trouble of a trial against a company that has no known presence or funds in the U.S., simply wasn't worth it. ""The government has concluded that further proceedings as to Concord, a Russian company with no presence in the United States and no exposure to meaningful punishment in the event of a conviction, promotes neither the interests of justice nor the nation’s security,"" prosecutors wrote. One expert on classified information said Monday that the belated acknowledgment by the prosecution was jarring. ""It's a bit surprising that prosecutors would make this claim so late in the proceeding. It's something they ought to have realized (and may have) months ago or longer,"" said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. ""Prosecutors will want to do a postmortem to understand how they got themselves in this position, and how they can avoid similar missteps in the future."" Prosecutors said recent developments in the case contributed to their decision, including difficulties getting Concord to cooperate with court orders to turn over certain information. They faulted the company for submitting a declaration claiming full compliance that was attested to by Prigozhin, someone they described as ""incredible.""  Prigozhin is widely known as Putin's chef because he started out as a high-end restaurateur, developed close ties to the Russian president and built the food-focused business into an empire doing contracting around the world for the Russian military. Concord Management and a related catering company were charged in the criminal case with conspiracy against the U.S. for seeking to frustrate the operation of U.S. election, foreign-agent, and visa laws. Friedrich did not offer any comment on the government's about-face, but did agree to accept and seal the classified explanation prosecutors offered.",Justice Department drops plans for trial over Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/russia-election-justice-department-132875,politico
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants the Army Corps of Engineers to build overflow hospitals. Bernie Sanders wants to call up the National Guard. Joe Biden says ""call out the military — now."" But the military isn't a cure-all, and there are significant legal and practical limits to what the armed forces can do during the coronavirus crisis. “The Department of Defense is ready, willing and able to support civilian authorities to the greatest extent possible at the direction of the president,” Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman told reporters Monday. “We just want to make sure that the conversation that we have is informed by the facts of what is possible and what is not and what those tradeoffs are.” Here is a rundown of the different ways the military could be used in the crisis, along with jobs that should be left to others. Current and former officials have proposed tasking the Pentagon with growing the capacity of the health care system to treat the sickest patients, specifically by deploying field hospitals and constructing care facilities. On Sunday, Biden said the armed forces ""have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation. They have done it. They did it in the Ebola crisis.” But Defense Department officials stressed that while the military does have some experience deploying what they call “tent hospitals,” these facilities are limited in size and capability. Most are small community hospitals tailored for the military’s disproportionately young, healthy community and their families, said Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon. The field hospitals, while they range in size from 25 beds to “much larger,” are designed to support trauma patients and combat casualties, he told reporters Monday. “What we are trying to be very careful about is not over promising,” Friedrichs said. “There are not thousand-bed medical centers all over the U.S.; they are for the most part small community hospitals.” Retired Vice Adm. Matthew Nathan, the former surgeon general of the Navy, said there are some things the military could do to ease the medical burden, but agreed it could only do so much. ""What we are really good at is ramping up trauma capability in a hurry,"" he said in an interview. ""If we just need beds, we are good at that, too."" But he pointed out that even in the worst circumstances such as widespread battle injuries, the military commonly deals with patients who are otherwise healthy and don't suffer from underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to infectious disease such as the coronavirus. ""As far as setting up ICUs to take care of the roughly 6 to 7 percent of patients who will need intensive care and ventilators long term, we don't prepare for that,"" Nathan said. But he stressed that there are other strategies to ""expand the surge of our hospitals."" Instead of treating infected patients, the military could take care of limited numbers of others ""who just need regular hospital care because they are not severe"" in order to free up beds and staff. The Navy’s two medical ships, the USNS Mercy and the USNS Comfort, can handle large-scale medical emergencies. Both contain 12 fully-equipped operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, digital radiological services, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, a CAT-scan and other capabilities, according to the Navy. But that only helps in areas near the water. ""If for example a community has a large outbreak and there's a need for emergency room support or trauma support, a hospital ship is perfectly designed to do that,” Friedrichs said. ""It’s hard to get the hospital ship to St. Louis, but along the coasts it is an option to use."" Another problem is that these vessels are not conducive to containing infectious disease outbreaks. “You have litters that are stacked toward the ceiling with individuals, you have open bay rooms — they are intended for trauma not for infectious disease environment,” Hoffman said, adding that “there are some beds for that, but at much smaller numbers.” Teams of Army researchers are helping to develop a vaccine and other countermeasures for the virus at installations around the country, including Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, both in Maryland. The teams have identified a potential vaccine that targets what doctors called the “spoke” or “spike protein” that helps the virus attach and enter human cells, Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, director of emerging infectious diseases at Walter Reed, told reporters at the Pentagon last week. The Army is testing the vaccine candidate on mice and will next move to testing on larger animals and humans to determine whether it is safe. But the earliest the vaccine would be available to the general population is 12 to 18 months, Modjarrad said. More long term, Nathan also says the military has a number of research centers around the world that specialize in disease surveillance ""before they can get a toehold on our troops,” including in Egypt, Peru and Singapore. Perhaps the most famous military doctor, Walter Reed, made scientific breakthroughs in treating communicable diseases in the tropics. ""Why was Major Walter Reed down there? Soldiers were dying of yellow fever."" The National Guard is playing the largest role when it comes to the military's response. As of Monday, some 650 troops have been called up in 15 states to help operate drive-through virus testing facilities, staff emergency operations centers, clean public spaces and transport health care personnel. The biggest contingent to be activated so far is in New York, where as of Monday 516 part-time soldiers and airmen have been called up. In Colorado, 145 National Guardsmen were assisting with drive-up Covid-19 testing centers and helping to plan future screening missions, according to the National Guard Bureau in Washington. Smaller continents, such as eight troops in West Virginia specializing in biological defense, have been activated to train civilian first responders on how to mitigate the exposure to the virus of paramedics and fire and rescue personnel. ""Bottom line, our force must remain flexible, innovative and ready to help America mitigate the impacts of this virus,"" Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement Monday. But so far, Guardsmen have not yet been “federalized,” or called up on a national scale. That could mean siphoning them away from their civilian jobs where they may already be helping their communities to counter the virus, said Friedrichs. Nor have separate military reservists been called up. “If we mobilize the Guard and Reserve medical personnel from their civilian jobs, they are no longer in their civilian jobs and that directly impacts the community where they work — that’s the tradeoff,” he said. The military does have some options to more efficiently deploy Guard and Reserve personnel, said Hoffman, pointing out the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, one of the global epicenters of the virus, has enlisted Guard and Reserve doctors. Yet there are only so many trained medical professionals in the military to go around. The hospital ships, for example, are currently manned by merchant mariners. The medical personnel to staff them would have to come from elsewhere, Hoffman said. The White House has denied rumors that President Donald Trump is considering a national curfew to limit social interaction until the outbreak is under control. If such a decision were made, however, any military role would likely be limited. And it would fall to the National Guard. The active-duty military is barred from conducting domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. The only circumstance in which the active-duty could be called upon to provide security would be under the Insurrection Act to suppress a revolt (a Marine and Army division responded to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, for example). As of Monday, the active-duty military has been asked only to make available a trio of military bases to quarantine cruise ship passengers exposed to the coronavirus. And a spokesperson said no military personnel are involved. “We have a lot of different capacities and we don’t speculate on how or if we'd use it,"" said Stacey Knott, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command in Colorado, which is tasked with homeland defense and to support civil authorities in responding to natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. The National Guard Bureau says it is not planning to play any law enforcement role at this time. ""We have the capability to do something like that but we are not burning calories on something that may or may not be happening,"" said Army Master Sgt. Michael Houk, a Guard spokesperson. ""At this point it looks like it is not happening. We are addressing existing needs."" But if a national curfew is necessary to enforce, the best way to do it is to empower individual states to carry it out. That would fall to traditional law enforcement agencies, not troops, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Steven Blum, former chief of the National Guard Bureau and deputy commander of U.S. Northern Command. ""It depends on how the president sets up the curfew,"" Blum said in an interview. ""Does he set it up where the governors are responsible so they can use the state police to enforce? If all the state governors agree to it and support it then it would be pretty easy. ""If I were advising the president,"" he added, ""I would advise them not to federalize the response but to coordinate the response and allow the states to tailor the response within their guidelines.""",Why you can't just 'call out the military' to fix the coronavirus crisis,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/military-coronavirus-defense-132801,politico
"Seven days before Donald Trump took office, his aides faced a major test: the rapid, global spread of a dangerous virus in cities like London and Seoul, one serious enough that some countries were imposing travel bans.  In a sober briefing, Trump’s incoming team learned that the disease was an emerging pandemic — a strain of novel influenza known as H9N2 — and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. “Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,” Trump’s aides were told. Soon, they heard cases were popping up in California and Texas. The briefing was intended to hammer home a new, terrifying reality facing the Trump administration, and the incoming president’s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe, this 2017 crisis didn’t really happen — it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump’s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama.  And in the words of several attendees, the atmosphere was “weird” at best, chilly at worst. POLITICO obtained documents from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed-door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics, and top officials from both sides — whether they wanted to be there or not — were forced to confront a whole-of-government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges, such as shortages of ventilators, anti-viral drugs and other medical essentials, and that having a coordinated, unified national response was “paramount” — warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the administration. That extraordinary turnover in the months and years that followed is likely one reason his administration has struggled to handle the very real pandemic it faces now, former Obama administration officials said. “The advantage we had under Obama was that during the first four years we had the same White House staff, the same Cabinet,” said former deputy labor secretary Chris Lu, who attended the gathering. “Just having the continuity makes all the difference in the world.” Sean Spicer, Trump’s first White House press secretary, was among those who participated in the meeting. He said he understood the reasons such exercises could be useful, but described the encounter as a massive transfer of information that ultimately felt very theoretical. In real life, things are never as simple as what’s presented in a table-top exercise, he said. “There’s no briefing that can prepare you for a worldwide pandemic,” added Spicer, who left the administration in mid-2017. The outgoing Obama aides and incoming Trump aides gathered for roughly three hours on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. At least 30 representatives of Trump’s team — many of them soon-to-be Cabinet members — were present, each sitting next to their closest Obama administration counterpart. Incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to keep dozing off. Incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry was getting along famously with Ernest Moniz, the man he was replacing, several fellow participants said.  But it was clear some on the Trump team had barely, if ever, spoken with the people they were replacing. News had broken that same day about national security adviser Michael Flynn’s unusual contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, so his presence in the meeting added to the surrealness. Some members of both groups kept going in and out of the room, but most paid quiet attention to the presentations, which were led by top Obama aides. Obama aides, in op-eds and essays ripping the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, have pointed to the Jan. 13, 2017, session as a key example of their effort to press the importance of pandemic preparedness to their successors. In a Friday op-ed, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, blasted Trump for comments such as “you can never really think” that a pandemic like the coronavirus “is going to happen.” She mentioned the 2017 session as one of many instances of the Obama administration’s efforts to help its successor be ready for such a challenge. She also slammed the Trump team for dismantling the National Security Council section that would play a lead role in organizing the U.S. response to a global pandemic. “Rather than heed the warnings, embrace the planning and preserve the structures and budgets that had been bequeathed to him, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic,” Rice wrote. (Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who oversaw the dissolution of the NSC’s global health security and biodefense section, has defended it as necessary streamlining, countering that global health “remained a top NSC priority.” Trump, when recently asked about the reshuffling, called the question “nasty” and said, “I don’t know anything about it.”) Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, explained the thinking behind the January 2017 session in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs. “Although the exercise was required, the specific scenarios we chose were not,” she wrote. “We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.” None of the sources argued that one meeting three years ago could have dramatically altered events today. But Obama aides say the Trump administration’s fumbling of the coronavirus outbreak is partly rooted in how unprepared — and in some cases unwilling — it was to engage in transition exercises at all in late 2016 and early 2017. David Shulkin, who was an Obama appointee at the time but had been nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary in the Trump administration, said in an interview that with the exception of this exercise, which he didn’t recall well, he noticed that in his agency, there had been “little coordination” and “very little interest in working with the Obama appointees.”  “They had said we don’t really have a lot of need to talk to the Obama appointees,” he said. That botched handoff sparked weeks of confusion, all the way up to Inauguration Day. “There was a frenzy before the transition where I was asked to consider staying because the [preparedness] mission was so important,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as Obama’s Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, where she worked on crises like the Ebola virus outbreak and attended the pandemic exercise. “Then through the HHS secretary’s office, the next day, I heard they changed their mind.” The Trump campaign, like the rest of America, was shocked to win the November 2016 election. Soon afterward, Trump cast aside his team’s transition prep work that had happened already and started over; some of his aides described tossing carefully collected binders full of possible personnel picks into trash bins. It was days, sometimes weeks, before his nominees and their aides showed up to meet the people they were replacing — if they did so at all — or to engage in transition meetings. Obama aides said they left detailed memos for their successors, but that quite often it appeared those memos were never read. Many on the Obama side were genuinely surprised that so many actually showed up for the Jan. 13, 2017, exercise, and there were expectations that some would skip it. On the Obama side, several agencies were represented by their second-in-command at the meeting for reasons including a belief that Trump’s principals wouldn’t show. The gathering was held to satisfy a requirement in a 2016 law that updated the procedures around presidential transitions to require, among other things, that the outgoing administration “prepare and host interagency emergency preparedness and response exercises.” Obama also mentioned it in a 2016 executive order laying out his transition goals. The 2016 law came about at the urging of the Partnership for Public Service, a good-government organization that helps administrations and candidates with the transition process. The emergency preparedness provisions were inspired by how George W. Bush handled his transition to Obama; that process, regarded as the gold standard for transition planning, included joint exercises on how to react to improvised explosive devices in cities. Bush had insisted on a detailed and highly coordinated transition planning in part because he felt scarred by the rushed transition he’d experienced from the Bill Clinton administration, not to mention having to deal with the Sept. 11 attacks during his first year. “The idea was hatched after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina precisely to prepare for situations like today,” said David Marchick, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition.  The Obama and Trump teams met in the afternoon, sitting around tables arranged in a rectangle. Participants were given a binder of unclassified materials titled “Presidential Transition Exercise Series,” the contents of which were obtained by POLITICO. The purpose of the exercise, the documents state, was to “familiarize” the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices and continuity of government programs” in case it faced a major crisis. One key goal was to explain to participants the various legal authorities they had to pursue a response, and which agencies had which capabilities and responsibilities. The references provided included detailed explanations of numerous laws and regulations that might affect their work, such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Aside from the H9N2 pandemic exercise, the participants discussed the case study of how the Obama administration handled Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One section covered a potential cyber incident. Another went through how to respond to a domestic terrorism incident, in this case one carried out by a group of U.S. citizens who placed bombs in nearby spots during a major sporting event in a U.S. city. The terror squad not only detonates the bombs, it also engages in a mass shooting and takes a dozen hostages. Using the materials, Monaco led the discussion. Her incoming counterpart, Tom Bossert, acted as a “semi co-chair,” attendees said. Ross, the then 79-year-old incoming Commerce secretary, was spotted with his eyes closed on more than one occasion. Elaine Chao, tapped to run the Department of Transportation, paid close attention. Several attendees noted the tense body language between Rice and Flynn, who lasted only a few weeks as Trump’s national security adviser and was ousted amid questions over his dealings with Russian officials. And then there was the Energy Department duo: Perry, the incoming secretary who previously served as the governor of Texas, and Moniz, the outgoing secretary and famed physicist. The pair seemed to get along fabulously, which stood out to other attendees given the overall distrust between the two teams and the fact that Perry had once proposed getting rid of the Energy Department altogether. It was a “semi-bizarro lovefest” between the two, a fellow participant said. “They were ready to go make a buddy movie.”  Perry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, Moniz, who now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, said, “It is correct that [Perry] and I offered relevant perspectives from a governor’s and Cabinet secretary’s seat, respectively. As governor of Texas for a long time, Perry had been through many episodes needing crisis management.” For the most part, however, the Trump team was in receive mode.  Partly, that was not a surprise: Many of Trump’s personnel choices had little or no government experience, and the Obama aides were presenting massive troves of information to them about how a raft of agencies had to work together to respond to various crises. Multiple current and former Trump officials reached by POLITICO said they did not recall much about the briefing. But some Obama aides who attended said they were left with the impression that many of the Trump aides showed up to simply check off a box more than to learn. The impression was boosted in part because the transition overall was going so poorly. Several Trump nominees had barely even spoken to their Obama counterparts.  The State Department representative at the meeting, for instance, was Tom Shannon, a veteran career foreign service officer serving as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Shannon attended instead of Secretary of State John Kerry in part because he would be staying on under Trump and was essentially the “transition designee.” But that Jan. 13, 2017, session was the first time he’d seen the incoming secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in person since Trump picked him for the job a month earlier. (Before the inauguration, Kerry and Tillerson spoke once, by phone, for a few minutes, people familiar with the situation said.) “The problem is that they came in very arrogant and convinced that they knew more than the outgoing administration — full swagger,” one former Obama administration official who attended said.  “There were people who were there who said, ‘This is really stupid and why do we need to be here,’” added another senior Obama administration official who attended, alleging that Ross and incoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were especially dismissive in conversations on the sidelines of the session. “But some Trump people, like Tom Bossert, were trying to take it seriously.” Asked for comment, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for DeVos, told POLITICO: “This is nothing more than a hit piece with no basis in reality. This department, under the secretary’s leadership, has taken swift action to support students, parents, and education leaders during this pandemic and will continue to do so. This former Obama official’s wild claims don’t comport with reality.” A Commerce Department spokesperson denied that Ross had dozed off. ""Secretary Ross found the meeting quite interesting and informative, taking many notes during the exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He continues to rely upon that knowledge and experience as he assists the president in confronting the crisis at hand."" Another participant noted that such exercises are primarily aimed at helping an incoming administration make it through the first several months of its tenure — “the idea being, of course, that during the transition period we’re uniquely vulnerable.”  Presumably, by the third or fourth year in power, the administration would have its own processes and muscle memory, the participant said. Asked whether information about the pandemic exercise reached the president-elect, a former senior Trump administration official who attended the meeting couldn’t say for sure but noted that it wasn’t “the kind of thing that really interested the president very much.”  “He was never interested in things that might happen. He’s totally focused on the stock market, the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit,” the person said. “The possibility things were things he didn’t spend much time on or show much interest in. “Even though we would put time on the schedule for things like that, if they happened at all, they would be very, very brief,” the former official continued. “To get the president to be focused on something like this would be quite hard.”  Anything associated with Obama or his administration was also a no-go zone for Trump aides. If you brought them up, “that would be an immediate rejection, like, ‘Why are they even here? Why the fuck did you ask them?’” Ben Lefebvre contributed to this report.","Before Trump’s inauguration, a warning: ‘The worst influenza pandemic since 1918'",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797,politico
"At Sunday night’s debate, Bernie Sanders scoffed at Joe Biden’s nearly $2 trillion — with a “t” — plan to combat climate change. “What Joe is saying is nowhere near enough,” Sanders said, dismissing Biden as an incrementalist. Republicans could barely contain their glee. To them, Biden’s pronouncements on a range of issues — from energy to immigration to health care — provided a trove of on-camera material to paint him as a radical in moderate’s clothing in the general election. Though Biden drew praise for a strong debate performance, his commitments underscored the line he’s trying to straddle between pragmatism and progressivism as he works to unite the party as the likely Democratic nominee. Republicans think his positioning will be particularly harmful in the Rust Belt states that decided the 2016 election, and where Biden is seen as a particular threat to Trump. “He effectively called for open borders — no deportations — and has already raised his hand for taxpayer-funded health care for illegals,” Scott Jennings, a former political aide in the George W. Bush White House, said of Biden’s leftward drift. “So, at the same time he’s called for a ban on fracking, he’s opening up America to a flood of illegal immigration. I’m sure this will fly in Pennsylvania and the rest of the upper Midwest. This issue — not to mention the tax increases to pay for abortions — will hurt badly in rural areas and in the big Senate races.” A Trump campaign aide told POLITICO on Monday that Biden had “openly declared war” on traditional energy sources, effectively pledging “a death sentence for the oil and natural gas industries.” Biden called for an end to new fracking (his staff later clarified he only meant on federal land). He said he’d endeavor to take millions of cars off the road, convert gas-powered fleets to clean-burning and end drilling on federal lands. He’d haul the world’s 100 biggest polluters before the U.S. in his first 100 days and make them pay an economic price. He’d convene the hemisphere to provide tens of billions for Brazil to stop burning the Amazon.  And that was on the environment alone. From immigration to social issues to health care, Republicans insist Biden is harming himself in battleground states where his appeal to centrist Democrats has long been viewed as an unmitigated asset. In a statement following the debate, Trump’s campaign even tried to yoke Biden to Sanders on health care, arguing that both offer “a complete government takeover” of the system. The warning shots at Biden come as Trump is message-testing ways to drive up excitement among his restive base while struggling with the enormous responsibilities of managing the coronavirus pandemic. Biden aides and allies view charges that he’s making himself vulnerable to Trump as fanciful. A Biden campaign official rejected the thinking outright, saying Trump will have to defend his record of supporting efforts in the courts to strip essential health coverage from millions. The Biden aide pointed to Trump’s caging of immigrant children and demonization of immigrants as antithetical to America’s values and his ignorance of the climate emergency as costing the U.S. when it should be pursuing green jobs. “These guys are going to have a tough time turning Joe Biden into an extremist liberal in this environment. In that context, Sanders served as a great foil for Biden,” said Tim Miller, a former adviser to Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, who voted for Biden in California’s March 3 primary. “Biden spent 30 minutes waving off Sanders’ claims that a trillion-dollar climate change plan is not enough — this is how you make a bold agenda look pretty centrist.” Trump’s campaign has signaled in recent days that it will try numerous approaches to confronting Biden — from questioning his mental acuity to focusing on what they view as his out-of-step liberalism. Dan Pfeiffer, the former Barack Obama adviser, dismissed the Republican strategy as reeking of desperation for a Trump campaign that had been planning to run against Sanders. The Vermont senator had appeared ascendant leading into Super Tuesday. “Trump already has the voters driven primarily by immigration,” Pfeiffer said, “so it’s about base maintenance as opposed to growing his vote share to a number sufficient to win.” “Several strategies,” he added, “is the same as no strategy.” For months, Biden has unveiled far-reaching plans that would make him a more progressive nominee than Hillary Clinton or his 2008 running mate, former President Barack Obama. Yet Biden has continued with his move left on past statements and policies relating to immigration, abortion, criminal justice and entitlement programs like Social Security. Now, poised to wrap up the nomination, he has grasped for even more olive branches as part of a broader effort to unify Democrats. Biden, who leads Trump in several battleground polls, has endorsed former rival Elizabeth Warren’s sweeping bankruptcy plan to strike through portions of a law that they once fought over. Ahead of Sunday’s debate, he gave his blessing to a Sanders-inspired plan to make college tuition free for students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. The debate offered him yet another chance to appeal to progressives. Biden pledged that under his administration only felons would be deported in his first 100 days, saying he’d focus on uniting families. “It’s about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent, he said. Biden also said undocumented immigrants arrested by local police should not be turned over to federal immigration authorities, after opposing sanctuary cities as a presidential candidate in 2007. He again distanced himself from voting for the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funding for the majority of abortions. Biden also restated his policy on public lands and waters, including prohibiting permitting of oil and gas drilling. Trump’s campaign has focused intently on Biden’s environmental and immigration remarks. “Fossil fuel industries employ 10 million Americans and he would yank the jobs out from under all of them. His plan would also drive heating and cooling bills through the roof,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s reelection campaign. Murtaugh said Biden’s plan to halt deportations would leave enormous numbers of other criminals in the U.S. who continue to pose a threat to public safety. And Biden’s position on locals not cooperating with federal immigration officials would “effectively turn the entire United States into a sanctuary country and tell the world that our borders are open,” he said. In a Monday email, America Rising, the Republican opposition outfit, cited a Wall Street Journal infographic that tallied up Biden’s agenda as costing more than twice as much as Clinton’s, with his proposed taxes totaling three times as much as the Democratic nominee four years ago. The message: Biden and Sanders “will be virtually indistinguishable.” “As we have said over and over, the eventual Democrat candidate will have to adopt the agenda of the extreme left in order to become the nominee in the first place, and Joe Biden proved that last night,” Murtaugh added.","Trump licks his chops as Biden veers left on sanctuary cities, fracking",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/biden-conservatives-trump-132214,politico
"A potential shortage of cotton swabs and other basic supplies needed for coronavirus testing is emerging as a new threat to the Trump administration’s plans to roll out high-volume testing to 2,000 sites across the country by the end of the week. President Donald Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said that millions of Americans could be tested in the coming weeks. But behind the scenes, some officials are warning the nation’s commercial labs that kinks in the supply chain for basic lab materials are the latest obstacle to broader testing. During a Sunday night conference call, HHS Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir warned more than 300 representatives of commercial laboratories, hospitals and state health departments that the Trump administration anticipates supply “speed bumps” as testing expands, a person on the call told POLITICO. The materials in question include swabs that medical workers use to collect samples of patients’ phlegm and saliva for testing, and disposable plastic tips for the pipettes that lab technicians use to transfer liquids. Testing labs say they’re also concerned about the availability of personal protective equipment for their staff. Fears about securing these basic supplies are the latest concern for public health officials as they scramble to institute the widespread testing that is desperately needed to track the spread of the coronavirus and limit the growing U.S. outbreak. The pace of U.S. testing has been slowed by shortages of critical materials used to prep patient samples for analysis and problems with an early test developed by the CDC. Now, the contrast between the administration’s public and private messaging on its plan to expand testing is rankling U.S. labs. The Trump administration announced Friday that it is creating a national network of 2,000 high-volume testing sites, with each processing 2,000 to 4,000 samples a day by the end of this week. To help reach that expanded testing goal, the Food and Drug Administration said Sunday that public health labs no longer have to send coronavirus samples to the CDC to be confirmed. That should reduce the wait for test results and the number of tests conducted for each patient, said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Twitter. The FDA also recently approved the use of more types of cotton swabs and of high-volume testing systems manufactured by Roche and Thermo Fisher. About 122 of of the Roche testing machines are installed at U.S. labs, the investment bank SVB Leerink said Monday, while Thermo Fisher said it is shipping its equipment to about 200 labs. And companies such as Qiagen, Quidel, Hologic and Cepheid are developing their own high-volume testing systems. But the commercial labs that are now performing the bulk of the country’s coronavirus tests say they need help from the government to secure sufficient numbers of swabs and other low-tech equipment. “We need the continued commitment from HHS and the administration to work with us to maintain the necessary volume of supplies,” Tom Sparkman, senior vice president of government affairs and policy at the American Clinical Laboratory Association, told POLITICO. State officials have echoed those concerns. “I’m worried now about access to an adequate number of swabs, not just the RNA extraction kits” used to prepare samples for analysis, said California Gov. Gavin Newsom at a press conference on Sunday. Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association, expressed anxiety over the United States’ testing failures and the looming shortages of equipment to test patients and protect lab technicians and other health care workers. “In order to take the specimen, it requires full personal protective equipment,” she said. “We are already short.” Victoria Colliver and Angela Hart contributed to this report.",Latest coronavirus testing glitch: Not enough cotton swabs,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-testing-glitch-cotton-swabs-132692,politico
"The Senate on Monday unanimously adopted a short-term extension of key federal surveillance programs that expired on Sunday night — a move that allows the chamber to more rapidly consider legislation addressing the economic impacts of the global coronavirus pandemic.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped an initial procedural vote Monday night on a House-passed bill that would reauthorize now-expired provisions of the 2015 USA Freedom Act and alter the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Instead, McConnell and his leadership team worked out a deal with civil libertarian hard-liners who oppose that House bill, including Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), on a 77-day extension of the surveillance powers. As part of the agreement, Lee and Paul also secured a package of amendment votes on the House bill, which has the backing of Attorney General William Barr and leaders from both parties in the House.  “We shouldn’t have to wait until the moment when we’re on the eve of the expiration of some important legislation and where we have to wait for the president of the United States to weigh in and lean in,” Lee said. “From time to time, laws require revision and review and reform. That always necessarily requires amendments.”  Senators were under intense pressure to clear the legislative docket to allow for the chamber to quickly take up a bill intended to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The House is expected to send a final version to the Senate as early as Monday night.  Lee and Paul, for their part, vehemently oppose the House’s FISA bill, contending that it does not go far enough to reform law enforcement’s surveillance authority. But they said they would be willing to back a temporary extension of the provisions if Senate GOP leaders allow amendment votes on the House bill, which passed in the lower chamber last week with a bipartisan majority.  “They can do it the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that they allow debate,” Paul told reporters.  Other senators indicated earlier Monday that they would support a temporary extension of the FISA powers out of concern that a prolonged lapse would hinder the U.S. intelligence community’s work.  “If the alternative is staying dark, I’ll take an extension,” Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) told reporters. McConnell did not address the negotiations on Monday afternoon, only saying the House bill was the best path forward.  “It reauthorizes the tools, which our national security requires, while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” McConnell said.  “The Senate should not wait to act,” McConnell added. “I sincerely hope that even our colleagues who may wish to vote against the House bill will not make us prolong this brief lapse in authorities and that we will be able to get these tools back online this week.”  Last week, Lee attempted numerous times to secure unanimous consent for a short-term extension, with an agreement to vote on four amendments to the House-passed bill at a later date. But Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) objected to Lee’s requests, saying it was unnecessary to drag out a debate over the FISA provisions.  Lee also spoke with President Donald Trump earlier that day and said the president told him he did not support the House bill. However, House Republicans indicated late last week that Trump does, in fact, support the legislation.  Three key FISA provisions lapsed on Sunday night after the Senate failed to reauthorize them before the deadline. The House bill addressed bipartisan concerns about possible overreach by the surveillance courts and ended an already deactivated National Security Agency program that allowed the organization to obtain, with judicial approval, Americans’ phone records in terror investigations.  The legislation strengthened privacy statutes and placed new restrictions on the FISA courts — inspired in part by Trump’s frequent complaints about his former campaign adviser, Carter Page, who was wiretapped as part of the U.S. government’s initial investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

"The House is unlikely to return from recess next week as scheduled, with Democratic leaders expected to keep the chamber dark until the next coronavirus stimulus package is ready for a vote, according to multiple Democrats.  Speaking on a conference call with the caucus Monday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats not to plan to return March 23 as scheduled and to stay tuned for more updates on Thursday. The announcement comes as congressional leaders face dueling missions: how to stave off economic disaster, while simultaneously protecting the hundreds of lawmakers — many of whom are older — from catching and spreading the coronavirus.   Several aides cautioned the chamber could resume legislative action as soon as the next day — March 24 — if the House was ready to vote on a third tranche of recovery money. Congressional leaders are in early negotiations over a massive legislative package they hope will heed off a potential economic collapse as industries, including airlines, hotels and restaurants, shutter to help prevent the spread of the virus.  U.S. airlines are seeking nearly $60 billion in grants and loans, according to a memo distributed on Monday, warning that Congress must act urgently to help several carriers avoid a “potential valley of death” going into the summer months. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, told Democrats he expects the impact on the industry to be “way worse than 9/11,” adding that some airlines are in “free fall,” according to sources on the call Monday.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) instructed Democrats to send ideas about what they’d like to see in the legislation to her office as House and Senate negotiators begin working in earnest on the next bill.  The House left town early Saturday morning after clearing a multibillion dollar stimulus package — its second bill aimed at stemming the outbreak — though it’s currently stalled in the Senate as negotiators hammer out a slew of technical tweaks.  Even so, Democrats and Republicans have been quick to focus their attention on the third legislative response to the outbreak — a measure that is expected to be the biggest so far, with members already comparing its size and scope with the bailouts approved amid the 2008 financial collapse.  Congressional leaders, as well as rank-and-file members of both parties, have already begun floating dramatic plans, such as cash handouts similar to the idea of universal basic income, popularized in the 2020 race by presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Several Democrats asked questions on the call about the possibility of a universal basic income policy — which Pelosi herself had initially been skeptical of, when it was floated at a recent Democratic meeting, though support has been gradually ticking up on both sides.  Pelosi told members on Monday that the priority was to keep people healthy and put money in people’s pockets, specifically mentioning refundable tax credits or some other mechanism, according to people familiar with the call. Top Democrats also discussed the possibility of expanding Medicaid, creating additional price-gouging protections and shoring up local transit and Amtrak.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday pitched a massive $750 billion proposal that includes direct cash payments as well as substantial support for small businesses and hospitals.   House leaders are also working to balance efforts to prop up the economy with anxiety among their own members, who waited around the Capitol for days while Pelosi negotiated a package of coronavirus response measures with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Members privately worried that they were being forced into packed meetings and hallways crowded with reporters and staff, despite increasingly pitched warnings from experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid those precise situations.  The CDC has now recommended that all gatherings of more than 50 people be canceled for the next eight weeks, complicating plans for the 435-member House and its thousands of staffers. Many Capitol Hill offices have already implemented teleworking strategies for aides, and some lawmakers have either self-quarantined or gotten tested for coronavirus after brushes with people who later tested positive. So far, no member of Congress has reported testing positive for the illness.  House leaders revealed Monday that they would be taking steps to prevent too many members from being on the floor even during votes, the rare occasion when most lawmakers congregate at the same time. Leadership offices in both parties have discussed ideas such as keeping votes open longer, to limit physical contact among members ""[P]lans are being developed to coordinate votes in order to limit the number of Members voting on the Floor at any one time,"" Hoyer's office wrote in a schedule update. Pelosi told lawmakers they may vote according to state or some other procedure when they do come back to limit the number of lawmakers being on the floor at the same time.  On Sunday, Pelosi wrote a letter to House members responding to their growing concerns and encouraging new steps to promote “social distancing” — measures to prevent close contact between people in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. “This may entail more than half of your Washington staff teleworking from home,” Pelosi wrote. “As this public health emergency develops, the House will continue to take strong, strategic and science-based action to keep the American people safe and ensure the continuity of Congressional operations.”",House eyes extended recess as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/house-coronavirus-recess-132370,politico
"The White House aims to deploy at least $800 billion in aid in the coming weeks to prop up the U.S. economy, as retailers, restaurants, sporting events and other businesses shut down and Americans slow their spending while staying home to guard against the coronavirus pandemic. Among the administration’s targets this week: providing relief in the form of tax deferments, loans or even direct payments to airlines, the hospitality industry and small-to-medium businesses crippled by plunging demand. Officials know they need to release the contours of their plan quickly — potentially as soon as Tuesday — as turmoil accelerates in financial markets, said a person familiar with the White House’s plans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow have specifically cited aid for U.S. airlines, as travelers cancel trips or avoid new bookings and public health experts advise older Americans to avoid flying entirely. “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch, we’re going to try to help them,” Kudlow told reporters Monday at the White House. He said the airlines had been in touch seeking aid, “lots of them,” and that “we’re in touch about their balance sheets and their cash flow.” Hotel CEOs are planning to visit the White House on Tuesday to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, as the hospitality industry also struggles from a serious downturn. The Treasury Department and National Economic Council met several times over the weekend to develop a list of options for the administration’s next phase of fiscal stimulus and held several conversations with President Donald Trump, said one senior administration official. So far, officials have discussed allowing industries such as airlines to defer tax payments or temporarily keep some of the taxes they collect from consumers. Airlines are seeking even greater assistance — nearly $60 billion worth — as they cancel flights and park plans due to collapsing demand for travel. The hotel industry has suggested options to help with their cash crunch including loans from the Small Business Administration, deferring tax liabilities, a temporary payroll tax cut or a tax credit to retain employees. Other suggestions have included offering loan guarantees, loan forbearance or the cancellation of debts through executive action or regulatory changes, said a Republican in close contact with the administration. Within the past week, as business plunged across the nation, the internal discussion among top economic officials has moved toward providing industries with cash and not just tax relief — even if no one in the White House wants to call it a bailout.  Kudlow said he preferred to call it more of a “short-term liquidity issue.” The goal is to help industries deal with the cash-flow crises they’ll likely face in the coming weeks, even if the administration sees no evidence of systemic risk. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point,” said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean, and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Industries across the board are starting to latch onto the idea of suspending the payroll tax for employers for the rest of the year. The largest business lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, included the idea in a letter it sent to Congress on Monday, and Trump has said he’d like the payroll tax either cut or suspended through the end of the year. Leaders from sectors including airlines, hotels and casinos have been warning officials behind closed doors about concerns they’ll have to start laying off thousands of employees if the shutdown throughout America continues — including in politically sensitive states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Half of the $800 billion in aid, under the latest White House estimates, would come from aid to workers and small businesses, tax deferrals and other moves already underway including deferring student-loan interest, buying oil and additional provisions of a relief bill already moving through Congress. The other half would come from a payroll-tax holiday through the end of the year — a move that would likely cost much more than $400 billion. The administration is also exploring with the Federal Reserve how it can deploy the central bank’s emergency powers to lend to nonfinancial firms, though the central bank’s authorities were curtailed in the political backlash to the 2008 bailout of insurer American International Group. The White House and economic officials are desperate to stave off a potential recession, since the economy has been one of the hallmark achievements of Trump’s first term and a key message for his reelection. The former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview that the March jobs report out early next month might show losses of more than 1 million. “It really could be the worst jobs report we’ve ever seen in our history.” He said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by a severe 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter.  “There is a dispute between the House and the Senate and the president about what to do,” Hassett said. “But imagine if it’s Friday when the jobs report comes out and it’s worse than we’ve ever seen. Then you’d see Congress act with urgency. The question is if they act with urgency ahead of the terrible numbers.” Hassett, who remains in contact with the White House, says he is not in favor of direct industry bailouts but is arguing for the payroll tax suspension at least for a quarter of the year. “You can do it quickly on the employer side and we need employers not to fire people,” he said. “And on the employee side, it could have a macro-economic effect. You could even offset the 5 percent economic decline with the payroll tax cut. And we don’t have to have a recession if the virus fades and the third quarter booms.”  In addition to hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders directly, the White House is hearing from informal economic advisers such as Moore with their proposals.  Moore said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal that’s expected to emerge from the White House and Treasury Department in the coming days. Moore authored a proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. The group suggested financing the payroll tax cut by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decisions about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Fed to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “We aren’t sure which of these Larry and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin like, but Trump listens to us,” Moore said. “He seeks out our advice. We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” A former senior Treasury official still in contact with senior members of the department said Mnuchin is aware that many Republicans will have problems with direct bailout payments to individual industries, but that he may propose them anyway for airlines, cruise lines and the entertainment industry more broadly. “The problem is the Wall Street [Troubled Asset Relief Program] vote still haunts those halls,” this former official said of the 2008 vote to bail out big banks. “It’s going to be like pulling teeth to get Republicans to vote for that. I think the White House is also open to refundable tax credits. And then you have the challenge of, ‘How do you help people exempt from the payroll tax?’’’ The person added that a plan could not wait until the end of the week. “It has to happen right away. Like, right now. Otherwise businesses are just going to start closing and laying people off right away.” Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",Trump team prepares rescue package of at least $800 billion,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-relief-package-132369,politico
"President Donald Trump on Monday acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic, releasing strict new guidelines to limit people’s interactions in an increasingly urgent bid to slow the virus in the next two weeks before U.S. hospitals are overwhelmed. “We have an invisible enemy,” the president said at a news conference, where he released guidelines that called for people to avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, steer clear of eating and drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts, and work or attend school from home whenever possible. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” The guidelines — including a strict recommendation that anyone with even minor symptoms stay home — are not mandatory. But they were issued with a sense of alarm and a frankness that Trump has not previously displayed. The president acknowledged that the crisis — which has already killed thousands around the world and set off a plunge of world markets — could last until July or August and even plunge the nation into a recession. No country, including the United States, has it under control, he said, though he also suggested America could limit its death toll “if we do a really good job” responding now. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus,” Trump said. “If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation, and we will defeat the virus, and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly.” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that while some people may perceive the guidelines as inconvenient or going too far, they reflect a deteriorating assessment of the containment efforts and should be taken seriously. “When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are. That’s not word speak. It means if you think you’re here,” Fauci said, gesturing to illustrate his point, “you’re really here because you’re only getting the results. Therefore, it will always seem that the best way to address it would be to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction. It isn’t an overreaction.” The White House gave the country a 15-day window to flatten the soaring curve of infection, but some disease modelers see a trajectory that could create a crisis, similar to Italy, that would start to overwhelm the U.S. health care system in about 10 days. Fauci called the 15 days “a trial” period for the guidelines to be reconsidered. “It isn’t that these guidelines are now gonna be in effect until July,” he clarified. “What the president was saying is the trajectory of the outbreak may go until then.” The new guidelines come on the heels of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance Sunday night that recommended the cancellation and postponement of gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. It also comes after the Office of Personnel Management declared federal offices in the Washington, D.C., area open but with maximum flexibility for telework. The president’s remarks reflect the increased urgency of the moment. As recently as Sunday, Trump was telling Americans to “relax” and that the pandemic would pass. And on Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow predicted that the outbreak would only impact the economy in the short term — “weeks and months,” he said, not years.  But hours later, Trump said the situation was “bad,” and administration officials pointed to new predictive modeling showing a need for more stringent social distancing measures. The case for aggressive social distancing is clear: A coronavirus vaccine is at least a year away, and the acceleration of the outbreak within the U.S. has put the it on track with some of the world’s hardest-hit nations.  “If everybody does what we’ve asked for in the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference,” said Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator. More than a month-and-a-half into the response effort and after failed bids to prevent and then contain the disease’s spread, the Trump administration is now scrambling to put its full weight behind a messaging campaign aimed at convincing people to do something simple yet unnatural: stay home. Still, public health experts said the administration has much work to do to sell Americans on such an abrupt change in habits and rebuild its credibility after weeks of mixed messages.  Trump was joined at the briefing by his key health advisers, including Fauci, Birx and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration’s response.  A growing number of governors earlier Monday followed the lead of fellow executives, announcing closures of bars, restaurants and other venues in states across the country. The new guidance similarly calls for any bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other venues to be closed in areas where there’s evidence of community transmission. Trump held separate video teleconferences with G-7 leaders and governors on Monday morning to discuss the response to the coronavirus. “Went very well,” he tweeted after speaking to governors. During the call, however, Trump urged governors to try to get respirators, ventilators and other equipment themselves. Hospital systems have raised alarms over a lack of beds and medical supplies to handle the crush of anticipated patients, and already some hospitals are beginning to postpone certain procedures in an effort to free up space and medical personnel. “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves,” the president told them, according to a source in the room. “Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” The New York Times first reported the president’s remarks to governors. Trump told reporters that governors would be able to get what they need sooner if they don’t rely on the federal government. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said while “the words did not quite come out right,” the president encouraged states to use whatever supply chains they have access to while the federal government attempts to maintain more respirators and ventilators. Administration officials also stressed the important role millennials can play in combating the spread of the virus. Birx called that generation “the core group that will stop the virus.” She said millennials are the most likely group to be the least symptomatic but also the group most likely to be out and about and in social gatherings. That means they could unknowingly spread the virus to older people or those with underlying issues, who are more vulnerable, if they ignore guidance and recommendations, but they’re also adept at communicating via text and across social media platforms. “Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25- to 35-year-old may find interesting and something that they’ll take to heart,” Birx said. “But millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.” Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CNN on Monday morning that the U.S. was “at a critical inflection point,” noting that America now has the same number of cases that Italy had two weeks ago. Italy is now on lockdown as it deals with more than 27,000 cases of the coronavirus, trailing only China, where the outbreak began. And public health experts have warned that without further dramatic steps, the U.S. could look like Italy by month’s end, with hospitals swamped by sick patients and hundreds of thousands of infected people freely circulating. “We have a choice to make: Do we want to really lean into social distancing and mitigation strategies and flatten the curve or do we just want to keep going on with business as usual and end up being Italy?” Adams said. As of Monday afternoon, more than 4,100 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing becomes available. More than 70 people have died.

"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a state judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an unprecedented order closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. Now, officials and voting rights experts say it's not clear whether and how voters will be able to participate in the still-scheduled primary with polling places shuttered, though DeWine, a Republican, has pledged to ""to extend voting options."" ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" he said Monday. But the state has not yet laid out the path to letting people vote.  ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" Ohio is one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward on Tuesday. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ...

"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is stepping up its response to the coronavirus by shutting its border to nearly all non-residents, except for U.S. citizens. Speaking to reporters Monday outside his residence, Trudeau said people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents will be denied entry into Canada. He noted there are exceptions for airline crews, diplomats, immediate family members of Canadians and, for now, U.S. citizens. ""As the virus continues its spread we've decided to take increasingly aggressive steps to keep you and your family safe,"" said Trudeau, who has been in self-isolation and working from home since last Thursday when his wife tested positive for the coronavirus. ""These measures will help save lives."" Trudeau said U.S. citizens are exempt from the ban because Canada's southern neighbor is in a category of its own. Canada will also strengthen travel restrictions in other areas. Trudeau said that, starting Thursday, international flights will only be permitted to land in four cities' airports: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. He said flights to Canada from the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean and Saint Pierre and Miquelon will be exempt from this rule. Airlines, he added, will be mandated to test all travelers and to prevent anyone showing symptoms of the virus from boarding a plane. The prime minister said Canadians returning home from abroad will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Earlier Monday, the Canada Border Services Agency added new questions for travelers arriving in Canada from all international destinations. The change, aimed at dealing with coronavirus fears, came amid confusion and criticism of the government’s airport screening process. Ontario Premier Doug Ford called on the federal government earlier Monday to tighten things up at the border. Ford also said he would support a federal government decision to shutter Canada's borders to visitors, including those from the United States, in response to the coronavirus. But Ford added that he would not want to see any closure to cross-border trade and commerce.","Trudeau: Canada to deny entry to all nonresidents except U.S. citizens, for now",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/canada-shuts-border-coronavirus-132332,politico

"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.  The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return. But since Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.  This will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump’s favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of “Fox & Friends” scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,” co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump’s administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus’ rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature “curvy couch” of the “Fox & Friends” set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored “the big plastic desk” one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio’s “fish bowl area.” “We’re doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don’t want to get infected and you don’t want to spread infection,” Doocy said. “We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Earhardt added. “And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.” The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. On-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was “actually the safest time to fly” despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of “overreacting” to the coronavirus. “It makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that,” Falwell said. “You know, impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico
"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and fewer than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  Among those surveyed, the president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than do not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, 49 percent to 44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy.”  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people; working or attending school from home whenever possible; and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. Its margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico
"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Pastelito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico
"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine's administration, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt backed by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an order from the state's top health official, Amy Acton, closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose insisted voters will still be able to vote. ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" DeWine said Monday. But DeWine's unprecedented order — closing physical polling places because an attempt to postpone the election failed — perplexed experts in election law. ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine said late Monday. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" A directive from LaRose to county elections officials late Monday night, following the polls closure, said the primary was postponed until June 2 and said counties are ""prohibited from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. ""There hasn't been an order to the Ohio secretary of state's office or to the governor's office that's been violated,"" LaRose told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday, arguing that state health officials acted within their jurisdiction. ""I serve as the chief elections officer for Ohio, and what I wanted to do was create certainty for Ohioans."" Ohio was one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced on Monday that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his Monday press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ... Election administrators have to be ready for anything. Except Godzilla.”  Natasha Korecki and Maggie Severns contributed to this report.","Ohio governor shutters polling places for Tuesday's primary, citing public health",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/ohio-governor-recommends-postponing-tuesdays-primary-132340,politico

"The government’s economic stimulus is set to quickly balloon into trillion-dollar territory in the coming days, the largest rescue in modern American history, as major industries flood the Trump administration and Capitol Hill for aid while huge swaths of the economy stall from the coronavirus crisis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans behind closed doors on Tuesday to present lawmakers with options for aid for airlines, hotels, casinos and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The White House was pushing for a package of more than $800 billion, POLITICO reported Monday, and on Tuesday the Treasury Department was preparing to unveil a package of $850 billion including more than $50 billion for the airline industry, $250 billion for small-business support and $500 billion for a payroll tax holiday. A senior administration official acknowledged the proposal could climb above that Tuesday by the time it’s unveiled.  Democrats are pushing their own package of provisions that don’t overlap entirely with the GOP pitch. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats are pitching a package of “at least” $750 billion that is expected to include more emergency aid for hospitals, expanded unemployment insurance, more funds for small business, help with child care, and food assistance for seniors. The size and scope of the package are morphing rapidly as the economic and market damage mounts. Senate Republicans and the White House are exploring how to fast-track existing legislation with the upcoming stimulus packages. The Trump administration’s goal is to provide sectors and companies with enough cash through emergency loans, tax deferrals or temporary tax cuts to help them survive the sudden downturn. The presentation is also expected to include an idea President Donald Trump has latched onto — a temporary cut or suspension of the payroll tax cut through the end of the year which would benefit both companies and workers. One version of the payroll tax holiday would cost $950 billion alone through the end of the year. CEOs, union leaders and lobbyists have been warning the administration of mass layoffs if the government does not help soon. Senators seem poised to act this week, while the House is still in recess. Cobbling together a stimulus package worth more than $1 trillion would mark a major ideological shift for Republicans, who spent years decrying debt and government bailouts following the 2008 global financial crisis. But with uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and the volatility in the stock market, the White House does not seem concerned about the price tag — only stopping the financial freefall. Other ideas that have circulated throughout the administration in recent days include inserting into the economic stimulus package a large-scale public works project; tweaks to the EB-5 visa program to boost foreign investment; tariff relief; and even a one-time cash payment to Americans between $500 to $750, according to people close to the administration.  The Federal Reserve and Treasury are already launching programs to provide support through emergency powers. The central bank on Tuesday announced a new lending program, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, under its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Treasury Department will provide taxpayer backing for the effort with $10 billion in capital from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.  “The economic disruption and uncertainty created by COVID-19 has created challenges for the commercial paper market, constraining access to short-term credit for American businesses,” Mnuchin said. “By providing short-term credit, the CPFF will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period.”  Some senior White House officials are also pushing Treasury to issue long-term bonds that would mature in 50 or 100 years to help cover the cost of the stimulus package. Mnuchin has said repeatedly in the past that he is considering issuing such bonds to take advantage of interest rates that the Fed has now pushed to near zero. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has long advocated for the issuance of such bonds, an idea also supported by outside economic advisers to the White House.  Republican Sen. Mitt Romney in recent days has called for giving every American over the age of 18 a check for $1,000 as a form of economic stimulus.  The coronavirus relief packages under consideration now by Congress are set to eclipse prior efforts.  The economic stimulus program cleared through Congress in early 2009 under the Obama administration was nearly $800 billion, including a tax cut, infrastructure and numerous other provisions. The bank bailout plan passed by Congress in 2008 under the Bush administration — formally the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP — authorized $700 billion originally intended to buy toxic assets from banks, mainly mortgage-backed securities that plunged in value during the housing crisis. The money was later diverted to multiple different programs to inject capital into banks. The TARP program ultimately disbursed around $426 billion and eventually recovered $441 billion, earning the Treasury Department a nominal profit of around $15 billion. That figure remains controversial. Taking into account inflation from the time of the bailouts, the government actually lost around $25 billion on the program.  It also generated widespread anger that banks and bankers got bailed out while ordinary citizens received far less. The Trump administration is well aware of this history and taking pains to avoid the same optics; top economic officials like Mnuchin and other senior aides around Trump keep emphasizing the need to help small and medium-sized businesses as well. “Everyone will need assistance and that is the bottom line. This is the demand issue because consumers have stopped spending,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a conservative-leaning group founded by entrepreneurs like The Home Depot founder, Bernie Marcus. “Every industry will need some level of assistance. In the past, Main Street America has not been as represented in some economic stimulus packages.”  Ortiz said he has been in touch directly with Mnuchin, who seems very amenable to including relief for small-to-medium-sized businesses in any package. The TARP program also drew widespread criticism for creating a moral hazard – banks could feel emboldened to take risks knowing the government would rescue them -- while creating fewer and even larger banks that now enjoyed a bigger federal backstop. Part of the reluctance among members of Congress and the administration to direct cash payments to individual industries like airlines and hotels stems from the TARP experience and deep voter resentment to corporations and their highly paid executives getting aid over regular citizens. Senior White House officials know that direct aid to airlines in particular may be necessary to avoid crippling bankruptcies, but they are leery of being seen as handing out bailouts and want to be sure that any such aid is dwarfed by proposals that would direct cash to consumers.  As top economic officials and Senate leadership negotiate this stimulus package, Trump is spending the day on the phone with executives from the restaurant and tourism industries, supply retailers and wholesalers. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with CEOs of major hotels including Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt and MGM Resorts International.

"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion. Nothing is set in stone, but the Washington Post reported that it will include around $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"President Donald Trump punched back on Tuesday against criticism from Democratic governors critical of his administration's coronavirus response, wading into his familiar political spats as the White House looks to combat a pandemic. Trump referred to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as the ""failing Michigan governor"" on Monday and lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after his calls for stepped up federal assistance. Minutes later, he heaped praise on his own administration for ""working very well with the Governors and State officials."" While Cuomo, Whitmer and other governors have been among the most vocal critics of the federal coronavirus response, they have been far from alone. The Trump administration has come under a steady drumbeat of scrutiny over its inability to quickly ramp up coronavirus testing capabilities as well as its weekslong rhetorical campaign to downplay the virus' threat to Americans. Only recently has the president reversed course in his own public utterances to warn the public about the severity of the pandemic's threat. The president's criticism of Whitmer on Tuesday appeared to be triggered by her appearance on MSNBC, where she said her state is working to flatten the curve by closing restaurants and bars after a federal government response that did not take the outbreak “seriously early enough.” She also outlined her plan to expand unemployment benefits as workers lose jobs and are forced to stay home amid the pandemic.  “The federal government did not take this seriously early enough, and now it is on us to make sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science available and that we are always putting the health of our people front and center,” Whitmer said on MSNBC. Trump soon after tweeted that the Michigan governor ""must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!” During a White House news briefing on Monday, the president also reportedly suggested that state leaders work to obtain medical equipment like respirators and ventilators on their own because of the slow federal process — a suggestion Whitmer called ""mind-boggling.""  “We need federal support. Like I said, we’re pulling out all the stops and reaching out to our partners in the private sector,” Whitmer said. “We’re going to do everything we can to supplement. But it’s not to the exclusion of federal support. We need the federal government to ramp up and to get this done.”  The president's feud with Cuomo, which bubbled up again Tuesday, has simmered for days amid back-and-forth criticism between the two men over the Trump administration's coronavirus response. The New York governor has repeatedly called for more federal help, to which Trump has replied that it is Cuomo who needs to do more. On Tuesday, the president accused Cuomo of playing politics with his criticism of the administration and suggested that a blanket federal policy of the type that some have called for would not be appropriate. ""Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,"" Trump tweeted, referring to the novel coronavirus by a controversial name that some in his administration have adopted. ""New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it.”  Trump ended his tirade against the governors with the tweet praising the federal government’s work with state and local officials, promising that “Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS.”",Trump lashes out at Dem governors amid coronavirus coordination,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-whitmer-cuomo-coronavirus-response-133716,politico
"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said Tuesday at a press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the Democratic process in our state.” But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus. “It is imperative that the people of the 7th Congressional District have a voice in the House of Representatives,” Hogan said.  “The State board of elections contacted us last Wednesday and said they were concerned about being able to conduct the election,'' Hogan said at his press conference. “They could not possibly do the mail-in for the whole state. They said they were incapable of getting it done in time ... but on a small basis in one congressional district for that one vacancy, we are going to ask the board of elections to conduct that election on time.  “We are going to encourage people to vote absentee as much as possible, and those who aren't doing the normal absentee ballot will be able to do whatever additional steps they decide to take for mail-in ballots,” Hogan continued. Hogan’s decision comes amid a national push from lawmakers, state officials and election law experts to allow anyone in the U.S. to cast their vote by mail in light of the public health crisis. Currently, 34 states and D.C. allow voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, and millions of voters still have to queue up in person on Election Day — an activity that blatantly violates new federal guidance against gathering in groups of 10 or more people, as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pointed out Monday when calling for the postponement of his state's primary. While advocates have unsuccessfully called for the adoption of universal vote-by-mail for decades, they’re hoping the coronavirus pandemic serves as a wakeup call.  “In the 15 years I’ve been pushing this, we’ve never had a public health and safety argument for this. Now, we do,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the lead author of a federal vote-by-mail bill, told POLITICO. “Now, for states to say they don’t have a fallback plan and they’re just going to cancel or delay elections – that's not acceptable when we’re in the middle of the pandemic.” Last week, Wyden introduced a retooled version of his decades-old bill targeted for situations like the coronavirus pandemic. He’s currently in the process of convincing fellow senators to support it, and pushing for it to be included in one of the upcoming relief packages Congress is currently putting together.  Under the legislation, if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency, all states have to offer universal vote-by-mail for one election cycle, and the federal government will provide $500 million to make sure pre-paid, self-sealing envelopes are distributed so that voters aren’t spreading germs or having to pay out of pocket.  Even without a federal mandate, Wyden says, the move towards vote by mail is already accelerating in red and blue states alike.  “States are already moving in this direction because people are saying, ‘What other options is there?’” he said. Maryland will likely not be the last state to postpone its primaries. Hogan said “other governors are expected to do” the same “later today, or the days ahead.” A spokesperson for Hogan tweeted that “we expect other Acela states to take similar steps.” The April 28 primary was informally referred to as the Acela Primary, because the states voting that day are connected by the popular Amtrak line. Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are all scheduled to vote on April 28; none of them have modified their primaries as of yet.","Maryland postpones primary, shifts special election to mail voting over coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776,politico
"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.   The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return.   But since some Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.   Another concern for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans is a practical one — if they let the Senate adjourn following passage of the ""Phase 2"" House bill, it may be logistically difficult to get senators back to Washington once they go home because of travel hurdles. Airline service has been severely disrupted so far, and situation may worsen. In addition, if one or more senators contract the virus, returning to Washington may prove impossible.  But the idea of combing two stimulus packages will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.   The White House Tuesday morning began signaling it was aiming for $850 billion in stimulus spending, split between a payroll tax cut, support for the airline industry and $250 billion in loans for small business.   ""I don’t know how it happens exactly yet. I know that 'Phase Two' will kind of be the baseline approach and then we’ll try and go from there,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) on Tuesday.   ""There’s a third iteration that we’re working on and how it gets across the floor and back to the House remains to be seen. I mean they could move separately, but maybe there’s a way we combine it,” he said.   The House passed the $100 billion-plus ""Phase 2"" stimulus bill on late Friday night, but then had to amend the package Monday with significant ""technical corrections"" following discussions between Mnuchin, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).   The revised legislation — which provides paid sick days and emergency leave to workers who are ill or have family members with coronavirus — is set to be taken up the Senate this week.   Several senior Democratic aides said combining the two packages into one would be a nonstarter in the House without significant concessions.  House Democratic leaders are already dealing with rank-and-file anger over a “technical corrections” bill the House passed late Monday that actually included a significant rewrite to the paid leave language in a major concession to the White House.  The change — which would allow more businesses to seek exemptions from offering their employees paid leave — was pushed by administration officials as necessary to get the bill through the Senate, according to multiple sources. But now, if the House-passed bill is combined with a huge economic package, they didn’t even need to make that major change, House Democratic aides argued.  In addition, several Democrats said the payroll tax cut was still a nonstarter, citing tepid support for the idea even among Republicans. And they threw cold water on the idea of just cutting checks to people, saying the bureaucracy needed to implement such a massive program could delay payments for weeks if not longer.  “All this stuff can come together fairly quickly,” said one Democrat involved in the negotiations. “The question is what are ideas that can come together fairly quickly? Something new like direct payments to people isn’t feasible.”  Democratic aides said they were instead looking at other ways to pad people’s wallets by expanding credits already written into the tax code.",White House eyes combining House bill with new coronavirus stimulus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/white-house-senate-republicans-coronavirus-aid-133732,politico
"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump’s favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of “Fox & Friends” scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,” co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays 6-9 a.m. Eastern and has achieved outsize influence under Trump’s administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend Americans maintain a distance of 6 feet to help thwart the coronavirus’ rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the show's signature “curvy couch.""  Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored “the big plastic desk” one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed behind a lectern in the studio’s “fish bowl area.” “We’re doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don’t want to get infected and you don’t want to spread infection,” Doocy said. “We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Earhardt added. “And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.” The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the coronavirus threat after being dismissive of its risk to Americans. On-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. ast On Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was “actually the safest time to fly” despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of “overreacting” to the novel coronavirus. “It makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that,” Falwell said. “You know, impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico
"There’s an easy way to tell that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a bad deal on the bipartisan coronavirus response bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. It’s not the liberal complaints that she let the White House limit paid sick leave to about one-fifth of U.S. workers. It’s not the Republican complaints that the bill doesn’t provide tax relief and cash for businesses and individuals hurt by the pandemic. It’s not even the general consensus that this initial legislation will need to be followed up by a much more aggressive economic stimulus bill. No, the easy way to tell Pelosi negotiated a bad deal for Democrats is that she negotiated a deal at all—rather than dictating the terms and telling President Donald Trump to take them or leave them. The lesson of the last congressional response to an economic emergency, President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill, is that when a president desperately needs legislation to address a crisis, anyone with the power to stop him can decide what’s in it. When Obama took office, in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Democrats controlled the House and Senate as well. But they needed 60 votes to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and there were only 57 Democratic senators, which meant Obama had to recruit three Republicans to vote for a stimulus bill. In just his second week in office, his blunt-spoken chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had to pose a blunt-spoken question to Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania: Whaddya want? Specter’s ask was simple, and by Washington horse-trading standards, noble. He wanted $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Then he would vote for the Obama stimulus. “Are you f---ing kidding me?” Emanuel exploded. Emanuel assumed $10 billion-with-a-b was just Specter’s initial bid, a shock-tactic negotiating ploy. But Specter gruffly said no, that was his final offer, take it or leave it. “What the f--- does a vote cost around here?” Emanuel screamed. In Specter’s case, it cost precisely $10 billion. He understood that Obama needed his vote to fix the economy, so he held all the leverage. But today’s congressional Democrats don’t seem to understand that at all. Right now, after initially downplaying the threat of coronavirus, then bungling the response to the pandemic, then watching the swift demise of the bull market he had hailed as proof of his leadership, Trump absolutely needs congressional action to limit the public health disaster and mitigate the economic damage on his watch. House Democrats can pass whatever bill they want, and if Republicans aren’t willing to go along with it, another lesson of American crisis politics is that it’s Trump who will suffer the consequences. Some Democrats have fretted that they might suffer politically if they don’t help Trump clean up the mess, but the opposite happened in 2009. The Republican minority in the House unanimously refused to support Obama’s stimulus, even though the crisis had exploded on his Republican predecessor’s watch, and the very next year those same Republicans took back the majority in the House. In fact, the only Republican in Congress who paid a political price was Specter, who had to switch to the Democratic Party after a GOP backlash over his vote for Obama’s stimulus, and ended up losing his seat anyway. In 2020, Democrats are not acting like a party with that kind of leverage. Instead, Pelosi frantically hashed out a compromise on Friday over 13 phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accepted Democratic proposals to expand free COVID-19 testing and unemployment benefits, along with a modest boost in food aid for the poor, but made it clear that permanent legislation mandating universal sick leave was a “non-starter” for Republicans. Trump ratcheted up the pressure by complaining publicly that Democrats weren’t “giving enough” in the negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the House proposals as “an ideological wish list.” Ultimately, Democrats accepted a temporary mandate that applies only to companies smaller than 500 employees, and allows companies smaller than 50 employees to seek exemptions.  “Democrats preferred to have something rather than nothing,” a Democratic source explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That was the choice we faced.” That was not the choice Democrats faced. Unlike the Republicans in 2009, who only had a filibuster-proof minority in the Senate, they also have a majority in the House, where they could have attached anything they wanted to the must-pass coronavirus testing and dared Republicans to say no.  If the president was unwilling to approve measures to help contain a pandemic and limit the economic fallout because he didn’t want sick workers to be guaranteed paid leave, he could have explained that to the public. He’s the president, the head of state, the “I alone can fix it” guy. He’s the one who will be judged by the outcome of the crisis that he initially insisted was not a crisis, then declared was under control thanks to his leadership. After all, Obama was held responsible for an economic crisis that erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, and the party that fought his efforts to fix the crisis ended up taking back the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. The public doesn’t follow the details of legislation on Capitol Hill, but it blames presidents for bad outcomes. The public also tends to blame presidents for partisan paralysis, while giving them credit for bipartisan cooperation; that’s why McConnell understood he could make Obama look partisan by fighting him, even though Obama’s stimulus was stuffed with tax cuts and other Republican priorities. It is true that Democrats would be accused of trying to exploit the crisis if they tried to load up a coronavirus bill with unrelated priorities such as, say, a “Green New Deal” to fight the climate crisis—although it’s worth noting that Trump and McConnell have already accused them of trying to exploit the crisis just for trying to mandate sick leave during a pandemic. But they still have the leverage to shape legislation just about any way they want if they’re willing to take the heat. In 2009, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine used her leverage to demand that the Obama stimulus include a technical fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax that added $70 billion to the price tag while providing virtually no economic stimulus. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine insisted on stripping a school construction initiative out of Obama’s stimulus—along with, ironically, an $870 million line item for pandemic preparedness. The 57 Democrats in the Senate also had the power to extract concessions for their votes; Obama had wanted a stimulus without congressional earmarks, but Dick Durbin of Illinois managed to include one for a $1 billion carbon-capture plant that never ended up getting built. Setting aside the question of whether Democrats should try to exploit the leverage to advance long-term policy priorities, they can absolutely exploit their leverage to address the short-term crisis. If they think universal sick leave will help, they should demand universal sick leave. Meanwhile, with Louisiana and Georgia already postponing primaries over the virus, why shouldn’t Democrats attach provisions guaranteeing that Americans will be able to vote by mail in November? Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, doesn’t understand why the Democrats didn’t insist on provisions restoring congressional oversight powers to help them ride herd on the administration’s response to the virus, ensuring that Trump and his aides can no longer defy subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Again, if Trump thinks it’s so important to prevent Americans from voting by mail and preventing Congress from overseeing his administration that he would block measures to accelerate the pandemic testing that his own team has botched, he can try to convince the public. “House Democrats don’t have some leverage,” Hauser says. “They have complete leverage.” By giving Trump the emergency measures that he needs most without insisting on the worker protections that Democrats wanted most, Pelosi has sacrificed some of that leverage. She has also helped the president look like a bipartisan consensus-builder, while essentially confirming the GOP talking point that Democrats have a responsibility to meet Trump’s demands in order to avoid a partisan stalemate. In 2009, Republicans simply ignored all the pundits warning that they would pay a huge political price for refusing to help the first black president fix an economic mess he had inherited—and the pundits turned out to be wrong. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders argue that it’s their duty to help Trump save lives and jobs in 2020, even though Republicans didn’t help Obama in 2009, even though Trump routinely calls them traitors, even though an economic downturn could doom his reelection. They’re pro-government people; they’re not inclined to stand in the way of government action during a crisis. When the Great Recession was just getting started in January 2008, Pelosi negotiated a quick bipartisan stimulus bill with Bush’s Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, and within months Americans were receiving $1,000 checks from the federal government. It’s an honorable approach, even though it also probably reduces Pelosi’s leverage. It’s hard to win a game of chicken when the other driver knows you’re committed to avoiding a crash. Once Trump signs this emergency response bill, he’ll start clamoring for a much larger economic stimulus bill loaded with tax cuts for airlines, cruise lines, his own hospitality industry and other Republican-friendly businesses, along with payroll tax cuts that can help get him reelected. And Democrats will find that many of the same Republicans who mocked the idea of using taxpayer dollars to stimulate the private economy as Big Government when Obama was in the White House—even though they had supported that bipartisan stimulus bill under Bush—will rediscover the attraction of Keynesian economics when it suits their party’s interests. Democrats will have to decide whether to meet Trump in the middle, or whether to risk the obstructionist label by holding out for what they want in a time of economic pain. They will also have to decide exactly what it is they want. Some of Obama’s top economists have publicly called for Congress to send checks to American citizens, which would help the economy and also Trump’s reelection prospects. Again, that’s honorable and responsible, especially since Trump is sure to denounce the Democrats as obstructionists no matter what happens, but it’s not clear it squares with Democratic rhetoric about the danger of Trump’s reelection, especially if they don’t get anything in exchange for helping to rescue the sinking Trump economy. In any case, Trump won’t be able to pass a stimulus bill without them. At a minimum, one thing they can demand for their cooperation is legislative assurance that economic stimulus can no longer be something that happens routinely only under Republican presidents. They should insist on more robust “automatic stabilizers” so that any time the economy craters, no matter who’s in the White House, Washington will automatically spend far more on food stamps, unemployment insurance and other aid to vulnerable families, and perhaps automatically roll back payroll taxes and other economic burdens. That way, members of Congress will no longer have the power to take the economy hostage during crises. For now, though, Democrats absolutely have that power. They need to choose their ransom wisely.",Pelosi Has Trump Over a Barrel,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-stimulus-132388,politico
"Much of American public life is at a standstill. But not the Democratic presidential race — not yet at least. While some future voting has been postponed because of the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus across the U.S., primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois are still on for Tuesday. Polling places in Ohio, which was set to vote Tuesday, have been closed down by public health officials after the governor pushed to delay the primary amid the public health crisis. Despite that, think of the vote as Super Tuesday, Jr.: The 441 delegates up for grabs in the three states still voting today makes it the third-largest delegate haul on the calendar, behind only March 3 and the slate of primaries planned for April 28. But between the coronavirus beginning to ravage the nation, the unprecedented, widespread closures that have shuttered public spaces across the country and Joe Biden’s now-commanding lead over Bernie Sanders — in polls released on the eve of the March 17 contests, Biden holds double-digit leads across all four states — the primaries are flying below the radar for many Americans. Last week, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio rejected calls to postpone Tuesday’s primaries, saying that they would make accommodations, including extending early voting hours, to prevent large crowds from gathering. But on Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a court in Columbus for a last-minute postponement of the primary. When the court refused, saying it was too late to postpone, the state’s health department ordered the polling places shuttered — despite a lack of clarity about how, or even if, voters might be able to cast ballots in the primary. The Ohio Supreme Court later effectively upheld the decision to close the polls. Here’s a state-by-state look at the map for Tuesday: Democrats are hoping that Tuesday’s presidential primary is the springboard to flipping Arizona in November. President Donald Trump won the state by just 4 points in 2016, and polls conducted there show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both competitive against Trump in the general election. Arizona will likely be the closest of the four states voting on Tuesday, according to pre-election polls. But Biden still holds a double-digit lead over Sanders in poll after poll — despite Sanders’ enduring, though not overwhelming, advantage among Latino voters. Hillary Clinton defeated Sanders in Arizona four years ago, 56 percent to 41 percent, and carried all nine of the state’s congressional districts. Polls suggest Biden is on pace for a similar victory, barring a surprise. The state is going ahead with its primary despite the coronavirus outbreak. Many voters cast their ballots by mail, but there is still significant disruption. In Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix and is home to roughly 60 percent of registered voters — most polling places are closed for safety reasons. Instead, the county is operating about 150 vote centers on Tuesday, where voters can cast their ballots regardless of where they live within the county. Bernie Sanders was blown out by Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 — and his prospects are no more promising in 2020. Polls show Joe Biden with a 2- or 3-to-1 advantage over Sanders, whose lack of support from older Democrats makes him particularly ill-suited for a state that is a magnet for retirees from the eastern third of the nation. Moreover, Sanders’ advantage with Latino voters in other states doesn’t translate to Florida, where many Hispanics are either immigrants or descend from immigrants from Caribbean and Latin American countries whose leftist leaders they despise. Polls show Sanders, who has praised some of the actions of those authoritarian governments, trailing Biden among Hispanic voters in Florida. The state has shuttered and consolidated a number of polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak. The state Democratic Party on Monday identified 91 precincts that were closed after GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered elections officials not to house polling places in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. But DeSantis resisted calls to reschedule the presidential primaries. “We’re definitely voting,” he told reporters in Tallahassee last Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Polls close in virtually all of Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern — but remain open an hour later in portions of the Panhandle in the Central Time Zone. Bernie Sanders had the Democratic establishment on edge four years ago when he stormed out of Michigan victorious and nearly beat Hillary Clinton in her home state of Illinois a week later. But in 2020, neighboring Michigan delivered a 16-point rout for Biden and has deflated the Vermont senator’s campaign here. Mike Bloomberg had started to make inroads here but when he, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar folded their campaigns, most of their moderate supporters — and their donors — joined the Biden camp. Gov. J.B. Pritzker also delivered his endorsement to Biden on primary eve. A WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last week showed Biden leading Sanders by 20 percentage points among likely voters in Illinois. Sanders recently rallied in Chicago with Rep. Chuy Garcia and other local Latino officials to help shore up his support. But the cloud hanging over the Tuesday primary is the coronavirus outbreak. Schools have been ordered closed and polling stations are being moved out of senior centers as the number of cases tick up, so it’s unclear what voter turnout will look like. The saga of Ohio’s primary adds significant uncertainty to a race that otherwise seems one-sided. Joe Biden led Bernie Sanders in the latest poll by 23 points — in a state Hillary Clinton carried by 13 points four years ago, winning all but 15 of the state’s 88 counties. Gov. Mike DeWine’s Monday night order closing the polling places came only about eight hours before they were set to open. DeWine said Secretary of State Frank LaRose would petition the courts “to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.” But it’s unclear how that opportunity would be extended, or when. The ambiguity extends beyond the presidential race. Ohio was set to hold all its primaries for the 2020 elections on Tuesday, including for Congress and state Legislature.",How to watch Tuesday’s primaries like a pro,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-to-watch-tuesdays-primaries-133318,politico
"For the second time in two years, Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the last members of a dwindling breed of conservative House Democrats who oppose abortion rights — is at risk of losing his seat in a primary. The Illinois lawmaker faces a rematch Tuesday against Marie Newman, a progressive upstart who nearly unseated him in 2018. But what should have been the left’s clearest shot yet at the incumbent is mired in uncertainty, with high-profile progressives distracted by Sen. Bernie Sanders's floundering presidential campaign and the election itself enveloped by the coronavirus crisis. Both camps are at a loss for how to handicap the race. “I personally don’t know,” said Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster working with Lipinski. “You love to say you’re a guru about these things, but there’s too many things we don’t know the answer to.” Lipinski is liberals' highest-profile 2020 primary target. Lining up behind Newman are Sanders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats.  Ousting him would be a much-needed victory for these progressives who have struggled to recapture the magic of 2018, including Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of a leading House Democrat, amid a series of roadblocks throughout the primary season. Their latest loss came on Super Tuesday, when Jessica Cisneros, a liberal challenger boosted by the Justice Democrats, failed to oust a moderate Democrat in South Texas. Other progressive Senate candidates also fell short in primaries in Texas and North Carolina. Lipinski's primary may have been their best chance for victory— before the coronavirus outbreak. Newman began March with clear momentum: She was outspending the incumbent on TV 2-1, and Lipinski supporters were nervous enough that they had begun urging Republican-leaning voters to pull a Democratic ballot and cast it for the incumbent. The biggest question mark now is turnout. Both campaigns are operating under the assumption that it could be at a historic low, with leaders, including Illinois' governor, urging citizens to be cautious about venturing into public spaces. Lipinski admitted in an interview last week he is combating a lot of unknowns. “We’ll see where the presidential primary is,” he told reporters in the Capitol. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, don’t know what the coronavirus — what impact that could have. So, just wait and see.” The Newman campaign has urged supporters to vote early, is prioritizing phone banking and has canceled its election night party. Both teams could make a plausible case that low turnout is to their benefit, depending on the age and ideology of who shows up. Lipinski’s team thinks he could have an edge with older voters, who tend to be more reliable and may be more likely to go to the polls. Yet the coronavirus disproportionately affects those 60 and older and public health officials urged elderly people to remain in their homes as much as possible. Other liberal challengers, such Ocasio-Cortez, have won low-turnout races in which the electorate is smaller and more ideological. The 2018 midterms brought roughly presidential-level primary turnout, and Newman came within 2,200 votes of ousting Lipinski. Though a new policy by the House Democratic campaign arm that blacklists consultants who work with primary challengers cost her some top campaign talent, Newman said she feels better prepared this cycle. “As you can imagine, your first time, out you learn a lot. And I did. And there’s things that I didn’t do well,"" she told reporters in a phone call last week.  Now ""we have an amazing voter outreach program,"" she said. ""I started fundraising a lot earlier this time.” Her campaign, she said, has knocked on more than 110,000 doors and made 90,000 phone calls. She had outraised Lipinski by more than $400,000 as of late February, and that contrast is shown particularly stark on television. Newman has spent about $900,000 on television advertising, while Lipinski has dropped less than $450,000, according to an analysis obtained by POLITICO. Plus, a coalition of abortion rights groups, including EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Planned Parenthood, has dropped about $1 million in TV ads knocking Lipinski. And outside allies who spent for Lipinski in 2018, such as the bipartisan group No Labels, have largely stayed out this cycle, leaving a stark disparity. “She’s got significantly more independent-expenditure resources than she had last time, and we have significantly less,” said Dave Heller, a media consultant for Lipinski, “which is the only reason why we’re worried.” Lipinski is reviled by the liberal wing of the party for a slew of positions and votes that range from his support for defunding Planned Parenthood to his 2010 opposition to the Affordable Care Act. He is now notably running an ad touting his efforts to protect that law and attacking Newman for supporting a single-payer health care plan. Still, Newman has centered her campaign on other issues like reducing gun violence and making health care affordable. She supports ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal."" Lipinski has pitched himself as more in line with the district and suggests Newman is too extreme: ""We should remain focused on what’s important. What really holds us all together as Democrats: the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress."" Yet there’s evidence to suggest his allies are leaning on independent and Republican voters to boost him in the Democratic primary. An internal campaign strategy document accidentally leaked in November suggested “GOP surrogates” could help Lipinski court Republican voters. Then this weekend, a Newman volunteer received what appeared to be an automated text message mobilizing GOP-leaning voters to ""stop"" Newman and Cook County (Ill.) prosecutor Kim Foxx."" Asked last week about the possibility of courting Republican voters — Illinois doesn't have party registration, so voters can pull whichever party's primary ballot they request — Lipinski said it was not the focus of his outreach but suggested he would take their support. “I think it’s good to have more people vote in the Democratic primary, bring them into the Democratic Party,” he said. Lipinski was first elected in 2004, after his father, then-Rep. Bill Lipinski, announced his surprise retirement and persuaded the state Democratic Party to nominate his son to replace him on that fall's ballot. The younger Lipinski could benefit from Chicago machine politics that boosted him and his father in the past. He will need to run up the margins in the Chicago part of the district, as he did two years ago, while Newman is banking on support in the southwest suburbs. A win by Newman on Tuesday would bring a surge of energy to progressives disheartened by a stinging loss earlier this month against Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, who also opposes abortion.  Cuellar and his fellow moderates have hailed his victory over Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, as an indicator that their caucus is still a big-tent party. “It bodes well for moderates and centrists,” said Cuellar, who said he had discussed his race with Lipinski. “A lot of members were very happy I won because they felt that, if I would have lost, then that would have created a momentum.” Sanders’ dismal performance in recent primaries has relieved some Lipinski supporters, who worried Sanders could drive out young and more left-leaning voters out to the polls, and that they would be more likely to support Newman. Interviewed last week at the Capitol as the House scrambled to cobble together a program to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, some top progressives suggested they had not been closely monitoring Lipinksi’s race or were otherwise preoccupied. ""Obviously, I’ve been very busy with the Sanders campaign,” said California Rep. Ro Khanna a top Sanders surrogate. “But I’m supportive of her; we did some fundraising for her.” “I don’t know any of the day-to-day detail stuff,” said Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Newman, when asked if he were following the race. The scaling back of large gatherings precluded any kind of final-weekend rally with big-name headliners like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez — though it’s unclear whether any would have materialized without the outbreak. Neither campaigned for Cisneros in South Texas. “I was always a little bit worried about this dynamic,” said Sean McElwee, the founder of liberal think tank Data for Progress. “The extent to which the top of the ticket was going to swamp out interest in the down-ticket stuff was always a danger for these primary challengers this cycle.”","This anti-abortion rights, Obamacare-opposing House Democrat is in trouble",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/dan-lipinski-primary-133226,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the Washington state primary, keeping a lead over progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to The Associated Press.

Washington votes entirely by mail-in ballots.  Biden secured victories in all states except North Dakota, which went to Sanders. His Washington win continues a surge for the former vice president that initially started with a rocky trail behind Sanders.  Biden won by more than 21,000 of the over 2 million votes cast, according to the AP. Though 13 candidates were on the ballot, Biden and Sanders were the main candidates after a litany of prominent Democrats — including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — dropped out of the race.

"Seven days before Donald Trump took office, his aides faced a major test: the rapid, global spread of a dangerous virus in cities like London and Seoul, one serious enough that some countries were imposing travel bans.  In a sober briefing, Trump’s incoming team learned that the disease was an emerging pandemic — a strain of novel influenza known as H9N2 — and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. “Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,” Trump’s aides were told. Soon, they heard cases were popping up in California and Texas. The briefing was intended to hammer home a new, terrifying reality facing the Trump administration, and the incoming president’s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe, this 2017 crisis didn’t really happen — it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump’s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama.  And in the words of several attendees, the atmosphere was “weird” at best, chilly at worst. POLITICO obtained documents from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed-door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics, and top officials from both sides — whether they wanted to be there or not — were forced to confront a whole-of-government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges, such as shortages of ventilators, anti-viral drugs and other medical essentials, and that having a coordinated, unified national response was “paramount” — warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the administration. That extraordinary turnover in the months and years that followed is likely one reason his administration has struggled to handle the very real pandemic it faces now, former Obama administration officials said. “The advantage we had under Obama was that during the first four years we had the same White House staff, the same Cabinet,” said former deputy labor secretary Chris Lu, who attended the gathering. “Just having the continuity makes all the difference in the world.” Sean Spicer, Trump’s first White House press secretary, was among those who participated in the meeting. He said he understood the reasons such exercises could be useful, but described the encounter as a massive transfer of information that ultimately felt very theoretical. In real life, things are never as simple as what’s presented in a table-top exercise, he said. “There’s no briefing that can prepare you for a worldwide pandemic,” added Spicer, who left the administration in mid-2017. The outgoing Obama aides and incoming Trump aides gathered for roughly three hours on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. At least 30 representatives of Trump’s team — many of them soon-to-be Cabinet members — were present, each sitting next to their closest Obama administration counterpart. Incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to keep dozing off. Incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry was getting along famously with Ernest Moniz, the man he was replacing, several fellow participants said.  But it was clear some on the Trump team had barely, if ever, spoken with the people they were replacing. News had broken that same day about national security adviser Michael Flynn’s unusual contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, so his presence in the meeting added to the surrealness. Some members of both groups kept going in and out of the room, but most paid quiet attention to the presentations, which were led by top Obama aides. Obama aides, in op-eds and essays ripping the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, have pointed to the Jan. 13, 2017, session as a key example of their effort to press the importance of pandemic preparedness to their successors. In a Friday op-ed, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, blasted Trump for comments such as “you can never really think” that a pandemic like the coronavirus “is going to happen.” She mentioned the 2017 session as one of many instances of the Obama administration’s efforts to help its successor be ready for such a challenge. She also slammed the Trump team for dismantling the National Security Council section that would play a lead role in organizing the U.S. response to a global pandemic. “Rather than heed the warnings, embrace the planning and preserve the structures and budgets that had been bequeathed to him, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic,” Rice wrote. (Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who oversaw the dissolution of the NSC’s global health security and biodefense section, has defended it as necessary streamlining, countering that global health “remained a top NSC priority.” Trump, when recently asked about the reshuffling, called the question “nasty” and said, “I don’t know anything about it.”) Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, explained the thinking behind the January 2017 session in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs. “Although the exercise was required, the specific scenarios we chose were not,” she wrote. “We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.” None of the sources argued that one meeting three years ago could have dramatically altered events today. But Obama aides say the Trump administration’s fumbling of the coronavirus outbreak is partly rooted in how unprepared — and in some cases unwilling — it was to engage in transition exercises at all in late 2016 and early 2017. David Shulkin, who was an Obama appointee at the time but had been nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary in the Trump administration, said in an interview that with the exception of this exercise, which he didn’t recall well, he noticed that in his agency, there had been “little coordination” and “very little interest in working with the Obama appointees.”  “They had said we don’t really have a lot of need to talk to the Obama appointees,” he said. That botched handoff sparked weeks of confusion, all the way up to Inauguration Day. “There was a frenzy before the transition where I was asked to consider staying because the [preparedness] mission was so important,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as Obama’s Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, where she worked on crises like the Ebola virus outbreak and attended the pandemic exercise. “Then through the HHS secretary’s office, the next day, I heard they changed their mind.” The Trump campaign, like the rest of America, was shocked to win the November 2016 election. Soon afterward, Trump cast aside his team’s transition prep work that had happened already and started over; some of his aides described tossing carefully collected binders full of possible personnel picks into trash bins. It was days, sometimes weeks, before his nominees and their aides showed up to meet the people they were replacing — if they did so at all — or to engage in transition meetings. Obama aides said they left detailed memos for their successors, but that quite often it appeared those memos were never read. Many on the Obama side were genuinely surprised that so many actually showed up for the Jan. 13, 2017, exercise, and there were expectations that some would skip it. On the Obama side, several agencies were represented by their second-in-command at the meeting for reasons including a belief that Trump’s principals wouldn’t show. The gathering was held to satisfy a requirement in a 2016 law that updated the procedures around presidential transitions to require, among other things, that the outgoing administration “prepare and host interagency emergency preparedness and response exercises.” Obama also mentioned it in a 2016 executive order laying out his transition goals. The 2016 law came about at the urging of the Partnership for Public Service, a good-government organization that helps administrations and candidates with the transition process. The emergency preparedness provisions were inspired by how George W. Bush handled his transition to Obama; that process, regarded as the gold standard for transition planning, included joint exercises on how to react to improvised explosive devices in cities. Bush had insisted on a detailed and highly coordinated transition planning in part because he felt scarred by the rushed transition he’d experienced from the Bill Clinton administration, not to mention having to deal with the Sept. 11 attacks during his first year. “The idea was hatched after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina precisely to prepare for situations like today,” said David Marchick, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition.  The Obama and Trump teams met in the afternoon, sitting around tables arranged in a rectangle. Participants were given a binder of unclassified materials titled “Presidential Transition Exercise Series,” the contents of which were obtained by POLITICO. The purpose of the exercise, the documents state, was to “familiarize” the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices and continuity of government programs” in case it faced a major crisis. One key goal was to explain to participants the various legal authorities they had to pursue a response, and which agencies had which capabilities and responsibilities. The references provided included detailed explanations of numerous laws and regulations that might affect their work, such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Aside from the H9N2 pandemic exercise, the participants discussed the case study of how the Obama administration handled Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One section covered a potential cyber incident. Another went through how to respond to a domestic terrorism incident, in this case one carried out by a group of U.S. citizens who placed bombs in nearby spots during a major sporting event in a U.S. city. The terror squad not only detonates the bombs, it also engages in a mass shooting and takes a dozen hostages. Using the materials, Monaco led the discussion. Her incoming counterpart, Tom Bossert, acted as a “semi co-chair,” attendees said. Ross, the then 79-year-old incoming Commerce secretary, was spotted with his eyes closed on more than one occasion. Elaine Chao, tapped to run the Department of Transportation, paid close attention. Several attendees noted the tense body language between Rice and Flynn, who lasted only a few weeks as Trump’s national security adviser and was ousted amid questions over his dealings with Russian officials. And then there was the Energy Department duo: Perry, the incoming secretary who previously served as the governor of Texas, and Moniz, the outgoing secretary and famed physicist. The pair seemed to get along fabulously, which stood out to other attendees given the overall distrust between the two teams and the fact that Perry had once proposed getting rid of the Energy Department altogether. It was a “semi-bizarro lovefest” between the two, a fellow participant said. “They were ready to go make a buddy movie.”  Perry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, Moniz, who now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, said, “It is correct that [Perry] and I offered relevant perspectives from a governor’s and Cabinet secretary’s seat, respectively. As governor of Texas for a long time, Perry had been through many episodes needing crisis management.” For the most part, however, the Trump team was in receive mode.  Partly, that was not a surprise: Many of Trump’s personnel choices had little or no government experience, and the Obama aides were presenting massive troves of information to them about how a raft of agencies had to work together to respond to various crises. Multiple current and former Trump officials reached by POLITICO said they did not recall much about the briefing. But some Obama aides who attended said they were left with the impression that many of the Trump aides showed up to simply check off a box more than to learn. The impression was boosted in part because the transition overall was going so poorly. Several Trump nominees had barely even spoken to their Obama counterparts.  The State Department representative at the meeting, for instance, was Tom Shannon, a veteran career foreign service officer serving as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Shannon attended instead of Secretary of State John Kerry in part because he would be staying on under Trump and was essentially the “transition designee.” But that Jan. 13, 2017, session was the first time he’d seen the incoming secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in person since Trump picked him for the job a month earlier. (Before the inauguration, Kerry and Tillerson spoke once, by phone, for a few minutes, people familiar with the situation said.) “The problem is that they came in very arrogant and convinced that they knew more than the outgoing administration — full swagger,” one former Obama administration official who attended said.  “There were people who were there who said, ‘This is really stupid and why do we need to be here,’” added another senior Obama administration official who attended, alleging that Ross and incoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were especially dismissive in conversations on the sidelines of the session. “But some Trump people, like Tom Bossert, were trying to take it seriously.” Asked for comment, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for DeVos, told POLITICO: “This is nothing more than a hit piece with no basis in reality. This department, under the secretary’s leadership, has taken swift action to support students, parents, and education leaders during this pandemic and will continue to do so. This former Obama official’s wild claims don’t comport with reality.” A Commerce Department spokesperson denied that Ross had dozed off. ""Secretary Ross found the meeting quite interesting and informative, taking many notes during the exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He continues to rely upon that knowledge and experience as he assists the president in confronting the crisis at hand."" Another participant noted that such exercises are primarily aimed at helping an incoming administration make it through the first several months of its tenure — “the idea being, of course, that during the transition period we’re uniquely vulnerable.”  Presumably, by the third or fourth year in power, the administration would have its own processes and muscle memory, the participant said. Asked whether information about the pandemic exercise reached the president-elect, a former senior Trump administration official who attended the meeting couldn’t say for sure but noted that it wasn’t “the kind of thing that really interested the president very much.”  “He was never interested in things that might happen. He’s totally focused on the stock market, the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit,” the person said. “The possibility things were things he didn’t spend much time on or show much interest in. “Even though we would put time on the schedule for things like that, if they happened at all, they would be very, very brief,” the former official continued. “To get the president to be focused on something like this would be quite hard.”  Anything associated with Obama or his administration was also a no-go zone for Trump aides. If you brought them up, “that would be an immediate rejection, like, ‘Why are they even here? Why the fuck did you ask them?’” Ben Lefebvre contributed to this report.","Before Trump’s inauguration, a warning: ‘The worst influenza pandemic since 1918’",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797,politico
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is facing pressure from inside and outside the State Department to be more forthcoming about the coronavirus’s effect on its 75,000 employees around the world.  Pompeo is expected to address the pandemic during a press conference Tuesday afternoon. The illness is forcing U.S. diplomats to scramble to help Americans affected overseas while also concerning them for their own safety.  The department has said it is aware of reports that least one U.S. embassy employee, in Jamaica, has contracted the COVID-19 virus, but has divulged little else. A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, told POLITICO there are several other confirmed cases at posts overseas, but none yet in Washington. State Department spokespeople have not offered comment. Frustration with State’s handling of the issue is growing both internally and externally. Lawmakers and staffers are raising questions about why Pompeo has not been more up front about his workforce’s cases of the virus, while also expressing concerns about a lack of uniform guidance from Pompeo on how employees should adjust their work habits.  The department “has not put forth a coordinated, robust response, which I fear puts the health of its own employees at further risk, and further jeopardizes the health and well-being of the American people,” Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Pompeo dated Monday.  Eric Rubin, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the diplomats’ union, also called for transparency. “We would urge that the administration share all information that is available so that our people have a clear sense of what the dangers are and what they need to do to be safe,” he said.  Some State Department staffers privately complain that they’ve not heard more from Pompeo directly on the issue. The internal messaging has been delegated largely to other top State Department officials, who have essentially told various bureau leaders and ambassadors to issue their own guidance to their staffers on whether to work remotely or take other measures to reduce the virus’ potential spread.  “The result is inconsistency,” one State Department employee said.  Pompeo has addressed the virus in at least one way: his occasional newsletter to employees. In a recent “Message from Mike,” he offered vague praise at the top for how the “team” has come together to face the crisis. But the message contained no specifics about the virus’s impact on the department itself.",Pompeo faces internal questions about his handling of the coronavirus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/mike-pompeo-coronavirus-134006,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering offsetting the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic by ""immediately"" cutting checks to Americans. Mnuchin, speaking at a White House press conference, did not say how much money Americans could potentially expect to receive, and indicated that the administration could seek to exclude those who are well-off from receiving payments. “We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin told reporters. “Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now — and I mean now in the next two weeks.” Mnuchin indicated that the president’s preference for a payroll tax holiday — a six- to eight-month process — would take too long to put money into Americans’ pockets. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now. So this is now,” Mnuchin said. “This is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy, and we are going to use all the tools we have.” Governors across the country have closed restaurants, bars and other venues across their states as public health officials continue to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The White House released new guidelines Monday encouraging people not gather in groups larger than 10, work and take classes from home as much possible and avoid dining in bars, restaurants and food courts. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 5,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing is made available. More than 90 people have died. Mnuchin, who left the White House briefing early for meetings on Capitol Hill, said he would preview the plan at a lunch with Senate Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed sending every American $1,000 and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has signaled support for a similar proposal to provide immediate economic relief to American families. “I think it’s clear we don’t need to send people who make $1 million a year checks,” Mnuchin said. “That’s one of the ideas that we like. We’re going to preview that today, and then we’ll be talking about details afterwards.”  President Donald Trump added that checks for everyone “may not be an accurate way of doing it because obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks for $1,000.” “We’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day what we’re gonna be doing,” he said. Mnuchin also announced that Treasury would defer an additional $100 billion in Internal Revenue Service payments, bringing the total to $300 billion. Individuals can defer up to $1 million, Mnuchin said, while corporations can defer up to $10 million. The deferments are interest- and penalty-free for 90 days. Still, Mnuchin encouraged as many Americans as possible to file their taxes by the April 15 deadline to ensure those who are eligible receive their refunds in a timely manner. “We don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. “We want you to make sure you get them. Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.”",Mnuchin: 'We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately',2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-government-payments-checks-133994,politico
"The government’s economic stimulus is set to quickly balloon into trillion-dollar territory in the coming days, the largest rescue in modern American history, as major industries flood the Trump administration and Capitol Hill for aid while huge swaths of the economy stall from the coronavirus crisis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans behind closed doors on Tuesday to present lawmakers with options for aid to airlines, hotels, casinos and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The White House was pushing for a package of more than $800 billion, POLITICO reported Monday, and on Tuesday the Treasury Department was preparing to unveil a package of $850 billion including more than $50 billion for the airline industry, $250 billion for small-business support and $500 billion for a payroll tax holiday. A senior administration official acknowledged the proposal could climb above that Tuesday by the time it’s unveiled.  The Trump administration is pushing to send direct payments to Americans in the next two weeks as huge parts of the economy shut down. “Americans need cash now,” Mnuchin said. “And the president wants to get cash now. And I mean now in the next two weeks.“ He planned to discuss the move with lawmakers and announce details later Tuesday.  Democrats are pushing their own package of provisions that don’t overlap entirely with the GOP pitch. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats are pitching a package of “at least” $750 billion that is expected to include more emergency aid for hospitals, expanded unemployment insurance, more funds for small business, help with child care, and food assistance for seniors. The size and scope of the package are morphing rapidly as the economic and market damage mounts. Senate Republicans and the White House are exploring how to fast-track existing legislation with the upcoming stimulus packages. The Trump administration’s goal is to provide individuals and companies with enough cash through emergency payments, loans, tax deferrals or temporary tax cuts to help them survive the sudden downturn.  The presentation is also expected to include an idea President Donald Trump has latched onto — a temporary cut or suspension of the payroll tax cut through the end of the year which would benefit both companies and workers. One version of the payroll tax holiday would cost $950 billion alone through the end of the year. CEOs, union leaders and lobbyists have been warning the administration of mass layoffs if the government does not help soon. Senators seem poised to act this week, while the House is still in recess. Cobbling together a stimulus package worth more than $1 trillion would mark a major ideological shift for Republicans, who spent years decrying debt and government bailouts following the 2008 global financial crisis. But with uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and the volatility in the stock market, the White House does not seem concerned about the price tag — only stopping the financial freefall. Other ideas that have circulated throughout the administration in recent days include inserting into the economic stimulus package a large-scale public works project; tweaks to the EB-5 visa program to boost foreign investment; tariff relief; and even a one-time cash payment to Americans between $500 to $750, according to people close to the administration.  The Federal Reserve and Treasury are already launching programs to provide support through emergency powers. The central bank on Tuesday announced a new lending program, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, under its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Treasury Department will provide taxpayer backing for the effort with $10 billion in capital from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.  “The economic disruption and uncertainty created by COVID-19 has created challenges for the commercial paper market, constraining access to short-term credit for American businesses,” Mnuchin said. “By providing short-term credit, the CPFF will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period.”  Some senior White House officials are also pushing Treasury to issue long-term bonds that would mature in 50 or 100 years to help cover the cost of the stimulus package. Mnuchin has said repeatedly in the past that he is considering issuing such bonds to take advantage of interest rates that the Fed has now pushed to near zero. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has long advocated for the issuance of such bonds, an idea also supported by outside economic advisers to the White House.  Republican Sen. Mitt Romney in recent days has called for giving every American over the age of 18 a check for $1,000 as a form of economic stimulus — a move the administration was moving toward by Tuesday.  The coronavirus relief packages under consideration now by Congress are set to eclipse prior efforts.  The economic stimulus program cleared through Congress in early 2009 under the Obama administration was nearly $800 billion, including a tax cut, infrastructure and numerous other provisions. The bank bailout plan passed by Congress in 2008 under the Bush administration — formally the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP — authorized $700 billion originally intended to buy toxic assets from banks, mainly mortgage-backed securities that plunged in value during the housing crisis. The money was later diverted to multiple different programs to inject capital into banks. The TARP program ultimately disbursed around $426 billion and eventually recovered $441 billion, earning the Treasury Department a nominal profit of around $15 billion. That figure remains controversial. Taking into account inflation from the time of the bailouts, the government actually lost around $25 billion on the program.  It also generated widespread anger that banks and bankers got bailed out while ordinary citizens received far less. The Trump administration is well aware of this history and taking pains to avoid the same optics; top economic officials like Mnuchin and other senior aides around Trump keep emphasizing the need to help small and medium-sized businesses as well. “Everyone will need assistance and that is the bottom line. This is the demand issue because consumers have stopped spending,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a conservative-leaning group founded by entrepreneurs like The Home Depot founder, Bernie Marcus. “Every industry will need some level of assistance. In the past, Main Street America has not been as represented in some economic stimulus packages.”  Ortiz said he has been in touch directly with Mnuchin, who seems very amenable to including relief for small-to-medium-sized businesses in any package. The TARP program also drew widespread criticism for creating a moral hazard – banks could feel emboldened to take risks knowing the government would rescue them -- while creating fewer and even larger banks that now enjoyed a bigger federal backstop. Part of the reluctance among members of Congress and the administration to direct cash payments to individual industries like airlines and hotels stems from the TARP experience and deep voter resentment to corporations and their highly paid executives getting aid over regular citizens. Senior White House officials know that direct aid to airlines in particular may be necessary to avoid crippling bankruptcies, but they are leery of being seen as handing out bailouts and want to be sure that any such aid is dwarfed by proposals that would direct cash to consumers.  As top economic officials and Senate leadership negotiate this stimulus package, Trump is spending the day on the phone with executives from the restaurant and tourism industries, supply retailers and wholesalers. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with CEOs of major hotels including Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt and MGM Resorts International.

"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion and likely to exceed $1 trillion. Nothing is set in stone, but it’s expected to include at least $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said Tuesday at a press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the Democratic process in our state.” But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus. “It is imperative that the people of the 7th Congressional District have a voice in the House of Representatives,” Hogan said.  “The State board of elections contacted us last Wednesday and said they were concerned about being able to conduct the election,'' Hogan said at his press conference. “They could not possibly do the mail-in for the whole state. They said they were incapable of getting it done in time ... but on a small basis in one congressional district for that one vacancy, we are going to ask the board of elections to conduct that election on time.  “We are going to encourage people to vote absentee as much as possible, and those who aren't doing the normal absentee ballot will be able to do whatever additional steps they decide to take for mail-in ballots,” Hogan continued. Hogan’s decision comes amid a national push from lawmakers, state officials and election law experts to allow anyone in the U.S. to cast their vote by mail in light of the public health crisis. Currently, 34 states and D.C. allow voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, and millions of voters still have to queue up in person on Election Day — an activity that blatantly violates new federal guidance against gathering in groups of 10 or more people, as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pointed out Monday when calling for the postponement of his state's primary. While advocates have unsuccessfully called for the adoption of universal vote-by-mail for decades, they’re hoping the coronavirus pandemic serves as a wakeup call.  “In the 15 years I’ve been pushing this, we’ve never had a public health and safety argument for this. Now, we do,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the lead author of a federal vote-by-mail bill, told POLITICO. “Now, for states to say they don’t have a fallback plan and they’re just going to cancel or delay elections – that's not acceptable when we’re in the middle of the pandemic.” Last week, Wyden introduced a retooled version of his decades-old bill targeted for situations like the coronavirus pandemic. He’s currently in the process of convincing fellow senators to support it, and pushing for it to be included in one of the upcoming relief packages Congress is currently putting together.  Under the legislation, if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency, all states have to offer universal vote-by-mail for one election cycle, and the federal government will provide $500 million to make sure pre-paid, self-sealing envelopes are distributed so that voters aren’t spreading germs or having to pay out of pocket.  Even without a federal mandate, Wyden says, the move towards vote by mail is already accelerating in red and blue states alike.  “States are already moving in this direction because people are saying, ‘What other option is there?’” he said. But even some proponents of mail balloting worry about a potential rapid switch to a predominantly mail-in system across the country. “I do think there might be particular challenges to go from in-person voting to almost exclusively vote-by-mail systems,” Dale Ho, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU, said.  “Look, if a state can do it … it is probably due diligence at this point to explore the possibility. But that is a major, major change in the midst of an election year,” he added, voicing concern that such major change could potentially disenfranchise some, like low-income or Native American voters, who may not have a fixed address on file with the state. Ho said that states should, at a minimum, adopt no-excuse absentee voting and make changes in the law to better accommodate voting by mail. Those changes include pushing back the deadline for when mail ballots must be received, allowing election officials to start processing ballots before Election Day, and providing federal funding to support state and local election administrators. Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer who also supports expanding mail balloting, said there also need to be changes to laws in some states that allow individual poll workers to toss out a mail-in ballot if they think the signature on the envelope doesn’t match the signature on file. Voters’ signatures can change over time, they argue, due to age or a disability.  “It's junk science,” said Elias, who is currently suing Michigan over its signature verification law. “At a minimum, voters need to be notified that someone doesn’t think their signature doesn’t match and given an opportunity to fix it.”  Maryland will likely not be the last state to postpone its primaries. Hogan said “other governors are expected to do” the same “later today, or the days ahead.” A spokesperson for Hogan tweeted that “we expect other Acela states to take similar steps.” The April 28 primary was informally referred to as the Acela Primary, because the states voting that day are connected by the popular Amtrak line. Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are all scheduled to vote on April 28; none of them have modified their primaries as of yet.","Maryland postpones primary, shifts special election to mail voting over coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776,politico
"Amazon is taking steps to speed the delivery of household staples and medical products amid a surge of demand because of the coronavirus pandemic — a move that threatens to devastate businesses that use its platform to sell less-essential goods. The country's largest online retailer notified vendors and third-party sellers today that it would temporarily halt the arrival of nonessential goods at its fulfillment centers until April 5. Products that are already en route to or stored inside its warehouses as of today will still be sold, Amazon said. ""We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. The company said it would place the highest priority on products in six broad categories: baby products; health and household goods; beauty and personal care; groceries; industrial and scientific products; and pet supplies. Amazon announced Monday it would hire an additional 100,000 workers in its U.S. warehouses to help handle increased demand. The news comes as several U.S. states and European countries have closed bars, restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and other businesses where people come into close contact in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. With the business closures and ""social distancing"" recommendations, more people are turning to online retailers like Amazon for basic goods like toilet paper and hand sanitizer.","Amazon expedites grocery, health shipments at expense of other products",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/amazon-expedites-shipments-coronavirus-134271,politico
"Joe Biden’s unequivocal declaration that his running mate will be a woman began the 2020 veepstakes with a brutal cut. There will be no consolation prize for Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg or Julian Castro. There will be no unity ticket pairing Biden with Bernie Sanders. Mansplainers and manspreaders, you can go home. Joe has binders full of women. Perhaps there has never been a more serious veepstakes than this one. Biden won’t say on the record that he would serve only one term as president, but he has given enough hints that many have assumed it. That makes his vice-presidential choice the automatic frontrunner for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, and potentially the first female president of the United States. This is no time for your last-call, falling-off-your-barstool, so-crazy-it-just-might-work vice-presidential musings. Already, some names Biden has casually thrown out are non-starters. Jeanne Shaheen is highly accomplished as a former governor of New Hampshire, but Biden should not team up with a fellow septuagenarian. Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates is a fun name to bat around, but getting fired by Donald Trump is not a qualification to be a COVID-19 diagnosis away from being commander-in-chief. Beyond a plausible president, the 77-year-old Biden needs a running mate who can help him either win the critical Midwestern states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, or energize the more racially diverse generations of young voters, who could help not only in Midwest cities, but also in Southern swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida. Who can fit the bill? My rankings, on a scale from Sarah Palin to LBJ-carrying-Texas-for-JFK: She’s a rising Democratic star who may have gotten a raw deal in the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia. But the plain fact remains that the pinnacle of her government service is as a state House minority leader. That does not cross the “Ready on Day One” threshold.  Donald Trump’s election showed that experience doesn’t matter to many voters. But Biden is running as the candidate of reassurance. The prospect of a manifestly under-qualified vice president serving under a president who is pushing 80 is the opposite of reassuring.  Warren did Biden two big favors in the primary. She incinerated Michael Bloomberg, and she has declined to endorse Bernie Sanders. Perhaps Biden would have won South Carolina and Super Tuesday anyway, but Warren’s assistance certainly didn’t hurt. Should Biden return the favor, and help unite the party’s populist and pragmatist wings with a Warren pick? Probably not. Warren has a lot of strong attributes, but being a deferential team player is not one of them. Besides, if Warren wants a job with real power that could clamp down on bad behavior from Wall Street, she should lobby for Treasury secretary or attorney general. Susan Rice may be the African-American Democrat with the most national security experience in the country, having served for the entirety of Barack Obama’s administration, first as ambassador to the United Nations then as national security adviser. No one could seriously question her qualifications to assume the responsibilities of the presidency if necessary. Yet Rice comes with the baggage of the Benghazi affair. Shortly after the 2012 attack on the U.S Consulate in Libya, which killed two American officials, Rice went on several TV shows and said the incident began as a “spontaneous reaction” to an anti-Islamic video, which was then joined by “extremist” elements. Rice was citing what was in the initial intelligence assessment, but Republicans accused her of covering up the role of terrorist organizations. (Later reporting concluded the attack was premeditated by members of a terrorist group, and there was no spontaneous protest, though some of the attackers were motivated by the video cited by Rice.)  Even if Rice can handle the rehashing of Benghazi, the last thing a presidential candidate wants from his vice presidential choice is an immediate distraction.  After just one year in office, the Democratic governor of Kansas has managed to strike an agreement with the Republican leader of the state Senate for a bill that takes advantage of the federal aid offered in Obamacare, expands Medicaid and covers an estimated 130,000 uninsured Kansans. There’s just one problem: the bill is stalled, short one vote in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle and get a floor vote. Regardless of the final legislative outcome, Kelly would be a long-shot pick. She would almost certainly be unable to turn Kansas blue in a presidential election for the first time since 1964. She is not well known enough in the Rust Belt to help flip northern swing states. And as a technocratic moderate, she would not fire up younger progressives.  People who want to put Michigan back to in the Democratic column have an eye on the state’s new governor. On Monday, Whitmer told MSNBC, “It’s not going to be me.”  Even if it is her, Whitmer may not be in a position to help lock Michigan down. When Biden campaigned with her ahead of the Michigan primary, he brought back her 2018 campaign slogan, “Fix the Damn Roads.” However, her attempt to fund the fixing of those roads, a 45-cent gas tax hike, was rejected by the Republican-led state legislature. She’s now issuing bonds to cover the cost of a less ambitious road repair program. A spotlight on Michigan’s partisan gridlock could complicate Biden’s efforts in the state. And a January poll pegged her job approval at a very soft 43 percent (although she was above water, with only 36 percent disapproving.) The New York Times reported this month that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer privately floated the name of the African-American congresswoman from Orlando. In her favor: national prominence after serving as a House impeachment manager, a law-and-order background from her 3 1/2 years as Orlando police chief, an up-from-bootstraps biography as the daughter of a janitor and a maid, and potential vote-getting ability in the swingiest part of the swing state of Florida. But Demings still looks like a stretch. Her political resume is thin, as she is only in her third year in the House. At 63, she may not be the best choice to rally young voters who are skeptical of Biden. And her tenure as police chief is not unblemished. When she first ran for Congress, National Journal reported that the Orlando police department “has a long record of excessive-force allegations,” and in 2009, she was censured “after her gun was stolen from her unlocked truck.” The New Mexican is the only Latina governor in the country. And Biden should like Lujan Grisham’s forceful enactment of a new “red flag law” for gun control. When she signed the bill, she took aim at sheriffs who indicated they may not enforce the provisions. “If they really intend to do that,” she said, “they should resign as a law enforcement officer and leader in that community.”  The Trump campaign has been targeting New Mexico’s five electoral votes. Hillary Clinton won only 48 percent of the vote in New Mexico in 2016. If Trump is truly threatening to poach the state, would Lujan Grisham help protect it? Like Whitmer, her level of support at home is short of intimidating. A January Morning Consult poll found her job approval at just 44 percent. While Lujan Grisham is the only Latina governor, Nevada’s Cortez Masto is the only Latina senator. She’s currently in the middle of her first term. Those who argue Biden is underperforming with Latino voters point to Cortez Masto as a fresh face who can help. Though whether Biden needs that much extra help with Latinos is up for debate. Sanders ran away with the Latino vote in the Nevada caucuses and the California primary. But Biden won with Latinos in swingier Virginia and North Carolina. Plus, Biden stayed closer to Sanders among Latinos in Texas than in California and Nevada. Furthermore, the low-key Cortez Masto has yet to make much of a national impression. That may not be a deal-breaker, but if Biden is looking for a candidate that brings excitement, he should look elsewhere. Today’s Arizona primary should factor into Biden’s decision-making. The increasingly purple state is where the Latino vote might make the most difference for Democrats in November. If Biden’s performance with Latinos is limp on Tuesday, then he should give Cortez Masto and Lujan Grisham, both Arizona neighbors, close looks. The Thai-American senator from Illinois has a gripping biography. While serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Iraq War, she was in a helicopter that was hit by a grenade. She was grievously wounded and had both of her legs amputated. Two years ago, at 50, she became the first senator to give birth while in office. She could easily become an inspirational figure as a vice presidential nominee. However, her backstory isn’t perfect. During her bid for Senate in 2016, Duckworth settled an embarrassing lawsuit accusing her of workplace retaliation when she led Illinois’ Department of Veterans Affairs, a position she was appointed to by newly pardoned ex-con, ex-Governor Rod Blagojevich. Her legal team maintained it was a “nuisance” lawsuit that was settled for only $26,000. But Biden’s vetters should give the case a thorough scrubbing. The moderate Duckworth could also attract barbs from the left. In the summer of 2018, she put some distance between herself and progressive sensation Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Asked on CNN if Ocasio-Cortez represented the future of the Democratic Party, Duckworth snarked, “I think it's the future of the party in the Bronx.” She further argued, “I think that you can’t win the White House without the Midwest and I don’t think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest.” Duckworth brings with her the hope that she can appeal both to older, moderates in Midwest swing states, as well as to younger votes who are eager for a woman of color in the White House. But if the ideological left can’t forgive her dismissal of Ocasio-Cortez, she’s not the right choice to help unify the party. Baldwin is a two-term senator from Wisconsin who could help win back a state that’s been on a political knife’s edge. She is the first openly gay U.S. senator in history, which could excite culturally liberal younger voters. And she’s an economic populist, which may even impress devout supporters of Warren and Sanders.  Being white, Baldwin wouldn’t give the ticket a multi-cultural image, and that could deflate some younger voters. But perhaps the biggest downside is that her ascendance to the vice presidency would create a Senate vacancy that gets filled by a special election, not by an appointment by the state’s Democratic governor. And in politically polarized Wisconsin, there’s no guarantee a Democrat would win that election. With the next Senate almost certain to be narrowly divided, the loss of even one seat could spell the end of Biden’s presidential agenda. If Biden really feels he needs help with flipping Midwest states, Amy Klobuchar is the safest pick. She successfully raised her national profile by running for president. She held her own on the debate stage. She showed that she had pull in Trump-curious Minnesota, helping throw to the state to Biden. And Minnesota’s Democratic governor can appoint her Senate replacement.  Yet Klobuchar is not without risk. Allegations of staff mistreatment tainted the start of her campaign, though no one ever went on the record. Biden’s vetters should certainly find out if there are more shoes that could drop. And Klobuchar’s role, while district attorney, in imprisoning a black teenager on reportedly flimsy evidence could be used by Trump to try to weaken Biden’s support among black voters. Progressive voices in the Democratic Party are already signaling they will react poorly to a Klobuchar pick. Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos tweeted Monday that Klobuchar “would be Tim Kaine 2.0—doing nothing to unify the party, bringing no new demographics to the ticket. It would be (once again) a disaster.” But complaints on the left are an inevitable, and manageable, annoyance. Winning the Midwest takes precedence. But there’s a twist. Biden should conclude, “I don’t need my vice-presidential nominee to win the Midwest. I can win the Midwest all by myself!” Polls and primary results show that he already has strong appeal to white, right-leaning, working-class and suburban swing voters.  Instead, Biden’s vice-presidential nominee would be most useful politically by shoring up his support among culturally liberal young voters eager to elect a woman of color in 2024. That’s why, of all the qualified women of color on the short list, the obvious choice was, and remains, Kamala Harris.  She doesn’t bring a state, but she wouldn’t cost the Democrats a Senate seat either. Besides, who was the last VP to flip a state? Maybe Walter Mondale in 1976. John Edwards couldn’t deliver North Carolina to John Kerry. Paul Ryan couldn’t deliver Wisconsin to Mitt Romney. Flipping home states may be thing that doesn’t happen anymore.  She doesn’t bring the far left, who deride the former prosecutor as a “cop,” but those folks won’t be satisfied with anyone Biden chooses. And if they don’t live in swing states, Biden can let them go. Harris, who is part of both the black community and the Indian-American community (which Trump has been courting heavily), would excite plenty of younger voters who can’t seem to get excited about electing another old white male. She’s a first-term senator who has not produced much successful legislation, but she is a road-tested orator who, over the course of the primary, was vetted by the media without surfacing any uncomfortable surprises. And she proved during the Democratic debates that she is effective at making direct attacks at her political opponents.  Some argue that Harris did too poor a job in the primary to live up to her reputation as a dazzling campaigner. But she didn’t fail because of her stump skills. Where she struggled—as did all the candidates who weren’t septuagenarian men with pre-existing bases of support—was with carving out a distinct ideological profile. She wrongly calculated, in the initial stages of the campaign, that she needed to lean further left than she was comfortable doing. Towards the end of her bid, she let her inner pragmatist shine. She will have no problem echoing Biden’s themes.  A Biden-Harris ticket could aggressively pursue the Upper Midwest, the Southeast and the Southwest, from to Maine or Montana, from Arizona to South Carolina. A thorough vetting process may discover problems that aren’t publicly known. And Biden will, at the end of the day, need to pick someone he feels will be a governing partner, not just a political asset. But the smart money is on Kamala, and no drama.","Biden’s Top 12 Running Mates, Ranked",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256,politico
"The Federal Reserve is aggressively moving to keep money flowing through financial markets battered by the coronavirus pandemic, making hundreds of billions of dollars available to ensure that cash is available to investors, companies and consumers. Days after the central bank slashed interest rates to zero, the Fed on Tuesday launched an emergency effort to make certain that big creditworthy businesses will continue to be able to access funding, amid concern that the cash would dry up. The Fed said it was reopening a crisis-era investment vehicle that will allow it to purchase IOUs from those companies. ""That is a $1 trillion market, and it is critical to American workers, it’s critical to American business and it’s critical to American savers who have a lot of that money in money market funds,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who had to sign off on the move, said at a White House press briefing. ""We heard loud and clear there were liquidity issues."" That comes on top of efforts to ensure smooth trading in key markets for U.S. government bonds and mortgages, such as by offering massive temporary cash injections and pledging to buy billions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. More actions are likely to follow, but without more drastic steps by Congress and the administration, its efforts might not be enough to avoid a broader breakdown in markets. Mnuchin and President Donald Trump outlined several ideas under discussion at the White House briefing. “The Fed’s liquidity injections appear not to be working,” Zoltan Pozsar, a managing director at Credit Suisse, said in a note Tuesday morning. “All segments of funding markets ... continue to show growing signs of stress. The Fed may have to do more still.” The stock market has whipsawed wildly over the past several weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday reporting its worst point loss in history and its biggest percentage-point drop since 1987. The Dow steadied on Tuesday and went up a bit following the Fed’s latest action and a White House progress report on a rescue package. Still, Bank of America Global Research said investors continue to be stingy about extending credit and there are concerns about the stability of various parts of the financial system. “Markets remain in a fragile state and will likely continue to do so until there is greater certainty around the path of COVID-19 outbreak and the fiscal policy response from governments around the world,” the bank said in a report. The Fed acted Tuesday to unclog the market for short-term business debt, with financial experts worrying that mounting problems there could spread and cripple other types of lending. “By ensuring the smooth functioning of this market, particularly in times of strain, the Federal Reserve is providing credit that will support families, businesses, and jobs across the economy,” the central bank said in a statement Treasury will provide $10 billion of credit protection for the purchases from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. Businesses that want to use the facility must pay a fee to register. Companies rely on the market for so-called commercial paper for quick funding, but mutual funds, a traditional buyer of the debt instruments, have been selling to make sure they have enough cash in case many of their customers are looking to withdraw money. “By providing short-term credit, the [Fed facility] will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period,” Mnuchin said in a statement. But Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said the Fed is ultimately constrained in how much it can do, in part because its emergency lending powers for firms other than banks were reined in after the 2008 financial crisis. Congress and the administration will ultimately have to take expansive action to help calm stressed markets, he added. “The Fed’s efforts, while laudable, are a necessary but not sufficient condition to address the nature of the crisis,” he said. “The bottom line is the reason why the market continues to experience historic levels of volatility is that it requires a fiscal response not exclusively a monetary response.”",Fed wages furious battle to unclog financial markets,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fed-battle-unclog-financial-markets-134282,politico
"In March 1918, with the United States fully mobilized for World War I, soldiers at Camp Funston in Fort Riley, Kansas, began reporting acute flu-like symptoms, including aches, respiratory distress, chills, coughing and high fever. Just a month later, over 1,100 men had come down with the disease; 46 of them (roughly four percent) had died. It was the start of the infamous “Spanish Flu”—a misnomer for the scourge that likely began in the U.S. but, as troops fanned out across Europe, claimed 21 million lives globally, including over 600,000 Americans.  What began in Army camps, where 25 percent of soldiers developed the flu, spread by fall to the civilian population. In Boston, 202 people died on just one day—October 1. Philadelphia later topped that record, with 700 deaths in one 24-hour period. The disease wasn’t discriminatory. It devastated urban populations like Pittsburgh and New York City but also hit vulnerable rural areas like Arkansas, where the public health infrastructure was essentially nonexistent.  Lasting just over a year, the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic stands as a lasting reminder of what happens when governments and their citizens fail to meet a crisis head on. From our perch today, as we brace for the coronavirus’ inevitable spread, the missteps of 1918 seem eerily prescient: A lack of leadership from Washington, with the gaps filled unevenly at the state and local levels. Public officials who either lied, dissembled or made up facts. Hucksters who used popular media to misinform the public and make a quick buck in the process. Public health infrastructure that was inadequate to the challenge. And ordinary citizens who often refused to heed the warning of experts. To be sure, science a century ago was light years from present day. The influenza outbreak was far more lethal in our great grandparents’ time than in our own because treatments were nowhere near as advanced. But even back in 1918, developments in medicine and public health had rendered diseases like cholera, typhoid and diphtheria—in recent memory, sure killers—manageable or even preventable. America’s cities and its military had extensive experience with quarantines and other social measures to stop vectors of transmission. And still, government bungling and a general lack of preparedness helped the pandemic spread like wildfire. Professional historians usually recoil from the old adage that “history is bound to repeat itself” (it really isn’t). And yet, sometimes it does. The lesson is pretty simple. Look at what went wrong in 1918. Then do the opposite. Lots went wrong in 1918. Start with the worst example, Philadelphia, where the local government failed abjectly to meet the public health crisis. The problem silently took root on September 7 when 300 sailors, some of whom were already infected, docked in the Navy Yard. Boston had already been hard hit by the epidemic, so city officials were well aware of its deadly potential. The city, whose infrastructure had buckled even before the war, was now teeming with new workers and migrants who stretched the housing stock, streets and transportation to capacity. It took but 10 days before over 600 servicemen and civilians were sick enough to require hospitalization, including several doctors and nurses who had been treating sick patients. Philadelphia’s director of Public Health and Charities, a political appointment that was, like most other positions, a sinecure of the city’s political machine, was Dr. Wilmer Krusen, a gynecologist who lacked training in epidemiology. From the start, he downplayed the severity of the threat, assuring the public that his office could “confine this disease to its present limits, and in this we are sure to be successful. No fatalities have been recorded. No concern whatever is felt.” When fatalities began to mount, he insisted there was nothing to worry about—it wasn’t the “Spanish flu,” but rather, just a few cases of the “old-fashioned influenza or grippe. … From now the disease will decrease.” True to his word, Krusden took no steps to assemble supplies or to identify doctors and nurses who could be made available in the event of mass hospitalizations. He resisted calls by other medical professionals that the city quarantine the Navy Yard.  And then, on September 18, the city held a monster parade to support the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive.  These were the high water mark days of America’s involvement in World War I. The federal government compelled, shamed and goaded citizens into conforming: From the Sedition Act, which forbade interference in the sale of war bonds, to the legions of Four Minute Men who delivered patriotic speeches in movie theaters as the reels were being changed—to say nothing of horrific acts of popular violence against German Americans—public spirit demanded that the parade go on. Tens of thousands of Philadelphians lined the streets to cheer the procession, providing the disease a tragic opportunity to spread. Within 10 days, over 1,000 Philadelphians lay dead, with another 200,000 estimated ill, and the state government in Harrisburg ordered the city’s public amusements and gathering places closed down, a ban that shuttered saloons, theaters, ice cream parlors and movie theaters. It was too little, too late: As the body count continued to climb, the Catholic archbishop assigned three thousand nuns and seminarians to staff makeshift hospitals and dig mass graves. By March 1919, when the threat of influenza lifted, Philadelphia had lost over 15,000 of its citizens. In Pittsburgh, local officials ignored the price of inaction to the east. They failed to line up hospital space and medical professionals, despite “harrowing stories that had come from other sections of the country of multitudes of dead,” the local Red Cross chapter later observed. When the governor ordered all cities to close most places of public accommodation, the mayor objected that “the whole thing seemed wrong,” echoing the city’s public health chief, who waved off calls to prepare for an onslaught of patients with the bloodless observation that “the disease was not affecting Pittsburgh to any great extent.” Of course, it soon did. Mortality rates (though not hard numbers) ultimately exceeded those of Philadelphia, though the city’s delayed and begrudging compliance with the state ban, as well as aggressive action by the Red Cross and other voluntary organizations, may have slowed the pace of infection in a way that spared funeral homes the same appalling over-capacity that hit other places. The failure of Philadelphia’s government to respond quickly and forcefully should have alerted other elected officials to the crisis. In some cases, it did, as in San Diego, where city officials took heed of the carnage that had overrun eastern cities like Philadelphia, Boston and New York and acted quickly to close churches, dance halls, gymnasiums, libraries, swimming pools and all public meetings—except, of course, outside war bond drives. Police enforced these measures aggressively. When the number of infected citizens did not immediately drop, municipal officials worked with the Red Cross to produce and distribute thousands of gauze masks, which many citizens balked at wearing, despite the entreaties of public health officials. The San Diego Union dismissed the very idea out of hand, observing that “modern civilization has abolished the mask as part of the human wearing apparel … only highwaymen, burglars, and hold-up men wear masks professionally.” Still, the city’s early and active efforts contributed to smaller mortality numbers than other municipalities. But the broader pattern that emerged was dismissal, dissemblance and outright deception on the part of public officials who either did not perceive the severity of the threat or who would not acknowledge it, for fear of political consequence. What mayor or governor, after all, wanted to go to war with local businesses, which in every city vocally opposed forced shutdowns? What health official wanted to run afoul of the coercive spirit encouraging war bond drives and other acts of solidarity with the men in uniform? In Denver and Cheyenne, officials caved to business pressure and lifted restrictions, only to reimpose them after the rates of infection and fatality climbed again. Even as his city reeled with the onset of disease, New York City’s public health director waved away calls for greater vigilance, finding that “other bronchial diseases and not the so-called Spanish influenza ... [caused] the illness of the majority of persons who were reported ill with influenza.” Though the federal Public Health Service encouraged cities and states to adopt best practices, in the earliest days when quarantines and shutdowns might have flatten the curve (to borrow from contemporary parlance), the U.S. Surgeon General, Rupert Blue, assured Americans that “there is no cause for alarm if precautions are observed”—a nonchalant remark that newspapers widely reported, and which imparted a false sense of calm. Even when the body count manifestly demonstrated otherwise, Colonel Philipp Doane, who led health and safety at the military shipyards where the disease first spread, dismissed the “so-called Spanish influenza” as “nothing more or less than the old-fashioned grippe.”  Woodrow Wilson, who mobilized a formidable public relations effort to generate populate support for the war, said nothing. This was a time before presidents routinely stepped in to counsel, console or calm the nation through a pandemic. It wasn’t only that many elected and appointed officials failed to meet the moment. In many ways, Americans were ill-prepared to confront a pandemic. The state of the country’s health care system was primitive by modern standards. In Pittsburgh, a city teeming with factories and industrial workers, the poor quality of air contributed to widespread, devastating respiratory problems. Even before the influenza set in, rates of pneumonia reached heights of 253 deaths per 100,000—appalling figures that outstripped every city except New York. In 1923 the Mellon Foundation found that unregulated soot and ash from factories was destroying the health of workers and their families, a condition that many other communities also faced. As well, Pittsburgh had no health infrastructure of which to speak: just 20 community hospitals, some staffed by only one nurse, with an acute shortage of beds. The housing stock was also poor, with most working-class residents crammed into tenements that, under the right circumstances, were petri dishes for disease. They were better off than the 50,000 residents who lived in rooming houses, where they not only shared rooms with perfect strangers but also beds, which they occupied in shifts. Rural America was hardly better equipped to weather the storm than big cities. In the 1920s and early 1930s, researchers would discover the scourge of Southern poverty that left large swaths of the population poorly nourished and afflicted with common parasites and disease. No less than their urban counterparts, the residents of small towns and country communities were physically compromised even before the influenza took hold. In the absence of calm and steady leadership from the top, there was no shortage of hucksters standing by, ready to profit from fear. One Dr. Franklin Duane gave interviews and ran advertisements for a fake home remedy (“Dr. Pierce’s Pleasant Pellets”), arguing that “the more you fear the disease, the surer you are to get it.” Dr. Bell’s Pine Tar Honey, Schenck’s Mandrake Pills, Beecham’s Pills and Miller’s Antiseptic Snake Oil also promised protection or relief from the flu. “When [Vick’s] VapoRub is applied over the throat and chest,” one wide-circulation ad informed readers, “the medicated vapors loosen the phlegm, open the air passages and stimulate the mucus membrane to throw off the germs.” Ordinary people could be forgiven a certain level of gullibility, notwithstanding very real advances in medicine and science that rendered such snake oil ads suspect. But in many localities, they resisted closures and quarantines with as much gusto as the owners of stores, saloons, theaters and restaurants. Neither did they segregate themselves at first indication of infection. In Seattle, according to a local newspaper, “every worker who sniffles is shot with [a] serum … they blow their noses and return to work,” despite entreaties from city health officials that they stay home. After the mayor unwisely suggested that if people observed the quarantine and closure rules, “the epidemic would be ended in five days,” residents began flouting the restrictions entirely. After all, if the mayor wasn’t concerned, why should they be? On one afternoon, when a “trophy train” packed with memorabilia parked itself downtown, thousands of Seattle citizens congregated for nine hours to inspect its wares. We don’t yet know how severe a toll COVID-19 will take on the United States. But we do know a lot. As in 1918, the White House and federal administration have been hopelessly ineffectual —even worse, irrelevant to the national response. Donald Trump’s stature as president appears to shrink with every passing hour. He wasn’t even able to deliver a factually correct speech to the nation while reading off a teleprompter.  As in 1918, state and local officials have responded in widely varying ways. Some, like Republican Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio and Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, have stepped up forcefully to compensate for the glaring incompetency of the Trump administration. Others, like Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who dithered in closing bars, restaurants and schools and even yesterday visited his own gym in defiance of every sound expert reccomendation—or Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and California Congressman Devin Nunes, Republicans who encouraged people to ignore the closures and self-quarantines—have likely endangered thousands of fellow Americans. As in 1918, cities have been slow to impose the types of sacrifices and hardships on local businesses and ordinary people that might have slowed the spread of the disease and thereby flattened the curve. And too many ordinary people have flouted the advice of medical experts until faced with blunt police force. As in 1918, the gaps in America’s health care infrastructure are potentially deadly. Every red state governor or legislator who refused the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid reimbursement has burdened its citizens with rural and small-town hospital closures. Their communities are unprepared for this disease. Many of their citizens suffer respiratory or immunodeficiency diseases that went untreated and have rendered them more susceptible to COVID-19. The absence of universal health coverage has contributed to poorer health, generally, and will likely encourage people everywhere, in red and blue states alike, to ration health care in precisely the moment when they should not.  There was a lot we could have learned from the example of 1918, but didn’t. There’s still more we can learn. It’s a critical week in America, and now more than ever, a little history might be just what the doctor ordered.","Rampant Lies, Fake Cures and Not Enough Beds: What the Spanish Flu Debacle Can Teach Us About Coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/spanish-flu-lessons-coronavirus-133888,politico
"The Chinese government announced Tuesday it would yank the press credentials for reporters of major U.S. news outlets, further escalating tensions between the two countries in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic which originated there.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that journalists from The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal whose reporting credentials expire this year will have four days to notify Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 10 days to turn in their press passes.  “They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions,” the announcement says.  The move comes weeks after the White House moved to limit the number of Chinese citizens who could work in the U.S. for several Chinese state-controlled outlets and ordered them to register as foreign missions. The foreign ministry admitted in Tuesday's statement that the moves are retaliatory, calling the Trump administration's restrictions “expulsion in all but name.” In addition to the three U.S. outlets facing expulsion, Chinese authorities announced that two more U.S. news organizations — Voice of America and Time Magazine — will be designated as “foreign missions” and required to turn over information regarding their “staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.”  Tensions between the global superpowers, already at a peak due to ongoing trade disputes, have spiked in recent months in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The disease, which originated in Wuhan, China at the end of last year, has now spread across the globe and in the past several weeks has forced U.S. leaders to take drastic measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.",China to expel journalists from 3 U.S. outlets ,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/china-to-expel-journalists-from-3-us-outlets-134170,politico
"President Donald Trump denied Tuesday that he has adopted a more dire tone in confronting the coronavirus crisis, insisting that he always took the public health emergency seriously despite several past dismissive remarks regarding the threat it posed to Americans. Speaking at the White House coronavirus task force’s daily press briefing, the president was questioned by reporters about his mood at Monday’s news conference, when he struck a graver note relative to his previous appearances discussing the burgeoning outbreak. “I didn’t think — I mean, I have seen that, where people actually liked it,” Trump said Tuesday of the response to his more sober-seeming public-facing demeanor.  “But I didn’t feel different,” he continued. “I’ve always known this is a real — this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” The president has been criticized over the course of several weeks for repeatedly minimizing the coronavirus threat, while public health officials within his administration have issued urgent warnings as to the risk the disease posed to the nation. In his first statements on the coronavirus in late January, Trump said the United States had it “totally under control” and tweeted days later that it “will all work out well.”  The president’s efforts to downplay the pandemic continued steadily until as recently as earlier this month. He accused the World Health Organization of producing an inaccurate mortality rate, falsely claimed that “anybody that wants a test can get a test,” and predicted that “it will go away. Just stay calm.” But the White House’s optimism seemed to dim significantly Monday, as the coronavirus continued to ravage communities and the federal government rolled out a new slate of stern guidelines intended to counter its rapid spread. Announcing the new measures, a subdued Trump lamented the “invisible enemy” facing Americans and acknowledged that “this is a very bad one.” The apparent shift in messaging coincided with the release of a report by British researchers estimating that as many as 2.2 million people in the U.S. could perish as a result of the coronavirus if drastic steps were not taken to fight its transmission. Addressing reporters Tuesday, however, the president argued that “there was no difference yesterday from days before” in his assessment of the coronavirus, and asserted that he had “always viewed it as very serious.” “I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t,” he concluded.","Trump, who downplayed pandemic threat, says he ‘always viewed it as very serious’",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-shifting-coronavirus-tone-134100,politico
"Last-minute negotiations between Democratic leaders and the White House have downsized the scope of a paid leave program for workers affected by the coronavirus outbreak, angering some Democrats who see it as a major concession to the White House.  The House on Monday night approved a slate of last-minute “technical” corrections to a sweeping aid package, paving the way for swift adoption by the Senate. But several Democrats and progressive advocates say changes pushed by the White House are actually significant revisions to the bill’s paid leave program, undermining one of their top priorities in the package.  “I think the changes the Republicans insisted on made this far worse,” Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who has pushed for far more expansive paid sick and medical leave provisions in the package, said in an interview Tuesday.  “The intent of the package was to provide workers the support they needed to stay home and prevent the spread of this disease,” Murphy said, adding that Democrats would push to restore the provisions in future bills. “We have a chance to take another swing at it. My hope is that we can get Republicans to understand the public health rationale.”  The latest version of the bill, which the Senate is expected to pass this week, includes a major change to federal paid sick leave and family medical leave policy for affected workers, a program long championed by Democrats.  The legislation initially allowed workers up to 10 weeks of paid leave — as part of the federal family and medical leave program — for three different scenarios: if they become sick or are forced to be quarantined, if they are caring for a sick person, or if they are caring for a child whose school or daycare has been closed. Under the latest changes, however, there is only one category that qualifies for the extended family and medical leave: Individuals who are taking care of children.  Pelosi appeared to address the criticism from some in her caucus in a statement on Tuesday, in which she vowed to push for expanded paid leave in the next package. “As the House develops our third Families First package, we are working to advance additional steps to expand the emergency leave mandate,” Pelosi wrote, laying out several provisions, including allowing workers who are sick to access longer term leave.  Democratic negotiators have also stressed that the core tenet of the program — paid sick leave for 14 days — remains intact, potentially helping as many as 87 million people during the public health crisis.   Pelosi was also able to secure other victories in the bill, such as ensuring that individuals who take paid medical leave remain entitled to health care coverage from their employer, which the White House had proposed rolling back. Democrats also upped the size of a tax credit for businesses who continue to offer health coverage to their employees, helping to defray the costs.  Still, several Democrats have been privately livid at the changes to the paid leave program, which was approved when members were back in their districts. And Democratic lawmakers and aides say the concession may be all for naught now that Senate negotiators are talking about combining the House-passed bill with a third major stimulus package and passing it all as one measure this week.   Democrats have complained that they already made major concessions in talks with Mnuchin as they tried to clear the package with House Republicans. The paid sick leave plan envisioned by Democrats had initially been far more dramatic — an entirely new program run by the Social Security Administration. But Republicans had revolted, and eventually both sides agreed to instead bolster tax credits to help businesses expand existing programs.  Now, Democrats say, Mnuchin has again moved the goal posts in an attempt to sell the package to Senate Republicans, some of whom remain skeptical about the costs on small businesses.  “It drives me crazy that it's been sold as a technical change. It's not. It's a major change,” one Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations said. “We had already moved a couple miles from what we introduced. Now we're talking about different worlds. This is extremely narrow now. “  The most recent version of the bill has also sparked confusion over a provision allowing small businesses to obtain exemptions from providing paid leave. The Labor Department can issue regulations exempting certain companies with fewer than 50 employees from requirements that they offer paid family leave and paid sick leave — an apparent difference from the original legislation allowing exemptions from paid family leave only, advocates said.   ""We think that paid sick time and family leave are pretty essential ingredients in how we’re going to be able to manage this,"" said Amanda Ballantyne, the national director of small business advocacy group Main Street Alliance. ""Exempting employers of 50 and fewer exempts a massive part of our workforce.""  In another significant change, the corrected version of the bill eliminates a provision that would have prevented states from receiving greater federal Medicaid funding if those states checked beneficiaries' eligibility more than once a year.  Several states conduct such checks multiple times per year, meaning the initial version could have deprived them of crucial funding ahead of an expected surge of coronavirus patients.   Senate Democrats led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand are expected on Tuesday afternoon to unveil new legislation designed to expand paid leave to all American workers.",Democrats say Mnuchin squeezed paid sick leave program,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/sick-leave-coronavirus-package-congress-134101,politico
"The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration could scare their communities from seeking out care for coronavirus, potentially hastening the spread of a deadly outbreak that’s growing rapidly in the United States, advocates and public health groups are warning. Those serving immigrant populations have reported significant drop-offs in immigrants seeking health care during Donald Trump’s presidency over fears of his administration’s tough enforcement measures. Immigration advocates and health care providers in some parts of the country say there are signs the novel coronavirus is already spreading in immigrant communities, intensifying efforts to fortify the populations against the highly contagious disease. Marco Trujillo, who handles immigrant outreach for a health care coalition in Cincinnati, says he’s fielded questions on coronavirus from dozens of people in the past few days. At least two of those people told him they had symptoms consistent with the virus but refused his pleas to contact a doctor. “They didn’t want to go to the hospital because they are afraid, because of their immigration status,"" said Trujillo, a member of Cincinnati’s Central Community Health Board. “They don't even want to give their information to a doctor.” Democrats have steadily warned that Trump’s immigration policies could undermine efforts to detect and stamp out the virus that’s effectively shuttered large sections of American life. Joe Biden in Sunday night’s Democratic debate, decrying Trump’s policies, said even “xenophobic folks” should want undocumented immigrants to seek out care for coronavirus without fear of deportation. “It’s even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly,” Biden said. Mary’s Center, a Washington-area health care nonprofit predominately serving Latino immigrants, said it’s starting to see potential cases of coronavirus among its patients, though it’s still awaiting results on the limited number of tests they’ve run. Executive Director Maria Gomez said she’s less concerned the center’s patients will be afraid to access care — the center is known and trusted in the immigrant community — and worried more about economic upheaval that’s already affecting their hourly wage jobs. She worries pressures to stay employed and avoid scrutiny of immigration officials will push immigrants to keep working even if they’re infected, increasing the chance of spreading coronavirus to others. “How will they pay the rent?” Gomez said. “They’re afraid to go get any help now because they were just working very hard to make ends meet.” Some lawmakers have called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to suspend immigration raids and arrests around hospitals and medical clinics amid the outbreak. The immigration enforcement agency, responding to concerns around coronavirus, said it ""does not conduct operations at medical facilities, except under extraordinary circumstances."" Public health experts say fears of seeking out care are very real among immigrants — and the clinicians who serve them. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist who studied a 2018 outbreak of mumps in an immigrant community in Pennsylvania, found the outbreak was exacerbated by dozens of people who were undocumented immigrants and legal immigrants without insurance avoiding medical care. Doctors in the area also hesitated to order lab tests or report potential cases out of concern their patients could be reported to immigration authorities. “The doctors had no intention of collecting immigration status, but they were nonetheless conflated with other government officials who did,” said Nuzzo, an associate professor at John Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. “That made it difficult for public health workers to learn how many cases there were and who had the disease.” Democratic officials meanwhile have also pushed the Trump administration to halt a new measure that could make it harder for legal immigrants to get a green card if they’ve used — or are deemed likely to use — safety net programs like Medicaid or food stamps. The revised so-called public charge rule, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect last month, had a chilling effect on legal immigrants seeking out care before it even took effect, advocates say. CDC Director Robert Redfield in Capitol Hill testimony last week acknowledged concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers that the public charge rule could discourage immigrants to get care. But other Trump administration officials have tried to tamp down those concerns. The Department of Homeland Security's immigration agency over the weekend updated its public charge webpage with an alert that ""encourages"" all immigrants with Covid-19 symptoms to seek medical care and said it won't count against their legal status. Still, the guidance — which was promised to lawmakers by Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner who heads the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services — notes that immigration officials must continue to look act use of certain public benefits, including ""those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19"" when they're making a decision about a person's legal status. An agency spokesperson also said the policy isn't meant to discourage immigrants from seeking necessary care — although immigration advocates and health clinics have long said that’s a clear effect of the rule. The Trump administration had estimated 77,000 people were likely to forego Medicaid because of the public charge rule, but health experts predicted millions of people may drop public benefits out of fear they fall under stricter guidelines. Nearly half of the nation’s community health centers reported immigrants were refusing to enroll in Medicaid and some even dropped coverage amid confusion about the public charge rule, according to a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation last fall. Some immigration advocates say there’s been little outreach from official channels on coronavirus geared toward immigrant communities. Those advocates, along with some states and local public health departments, have been trying to fill the gap. In the Texas county that includes the progressive-minded Austin, county officials have set up a coronavirus hotline at clinics that provide care to the uninsured and undocumented. “We are making sure everyone has access to quality care regardless of their citizenship status,” said Ted Burton, vice president of communications at Central Health. “As a community everybody has been really focused on response, prevention and education.”",Trump's immigration crackdown could hurt coronavirus containment efforts,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-immigration-coronavirus-134112,politico

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday acknowledged that there are at least “a couple” of State Department employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus, an admission that comes as he faces pressure from inside and outside his workforce to be more forthcoming about the illness’ impact on his 75,000 staffers worldwide. Pompeo addressed the pandemic during a brief but wide-ranging press conference Tuesday afternoon, but offered few specifics and only after repeated questions. The coronavirus crisis is forcing U.S. diplomats to scramble to help Americans affected overseas while also concerning them for their own safety. “We've had a couple of employees, count them on one hand, who have positive tests,“ Pompeo told reporters at the State Department headquarters in Washington. He did not say where the employees were working, but insisted that the department is handling the cases according to health guidelines.  The department has said it is aware of reports that least one U.S. embassy employee, in Jamaica, has contracted the COVID-19 virus, but otherwise it has divulged little else. A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, told POLITICO there are several other confirmed cases at posts overseas, but none yet in Washington. State Department spokespeople have not offered comment. Frustration with State’s handling of the issue is growing both internally and externally.  Lawmakers and staffers are raising questions about why Pompeo has not been more up front about his workforce’s cases of the virus, while also expressing concerns about a lack of uniform guidance from Pompeo on how employees should adjust their work habits.  The department “has not put forth a coordinated, robust response, which I fear puts the health of its own employees at further risk, and further jeopardizes the health and well-being of the American people,” Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Pompeo dated Monday.  Eric Rubin, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the diplomats’ union, also called for transparency. “We would urge that the administration share all information that is available so that our people have a clear sense of what the dangers are and what they need to do to be safe,” he said.  Pompeo said during his Tuesday news conference that the department has taken “many measures” to protect its workforce, referring to “some 15 guidelines“ along with placing limits on travel. But he declined to go into the “intricacies“ of the department’s actions. Some State Department staffers have privately complained that they’ve not heard more from Pompeo directly on the issue. The internal communication and messaging have been delegated largely to other top State Department officials, who have essentially told various bureau leaders and ambassadors to issue their own guidance to their staffers on whether to work remotely or take other measures to reduce the virus’ potential spread.  “The result is inconsistency,” one State Department employee said.  Prior to Tuesday, Pompeo had addressed the virus in at least one way for his employees: his occasional newsletter. In a recent “Message from Mike,” he offered vague praise at the top for how the “team” has come together to face the crisis. But the message contained no specifics about the virus’s impact on the department itself. Pompeo spent much of the press conference Tuesday addressing other aspects of the coronavirus, including bashing how Iran has handled the crisis in its borders. Pompeo has been a champion of President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure policy toward Iran, which involves heavily sanctioning the Islamist regime there. Those economic sanctions, some critics argue, have hampered Iran’s ability to react to the virus ravaging its population. Pompeo, however, disagreed, arguing that the U.S. anti-Iran campaign allows for humanitarian aid and saying it was the regime’s incompetence and corruption that was fueling the coronavirus crisis. “The Iranian regime is an accomplice,” he said. Pompeo also used the term “Wuhan virus” during the news conference, in a jab at China, where officials have been suggesting, with zero evidence, that the coronavirus may have originated from the United States. Wuhan is the city that has been the epicenter of the virus in China.",Pompeo faces internal questions about his handling of the coronavirus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/mike-pompeo-coronavirus-134006,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering offsetting the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic by “immediately” cutting checks to Americans. Mnuchin, speaking at a White House press conference, did not say how much money Americans could potentially expect to receive, and indicated that the administration could seek to exclude those who are well-off from receiving payments. “We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin told reporters. “Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now — and I mean now in the next two weeks.” Mnuchin indicated that the president’s preference for a payroll tax holiday — a six- to eight-month process — would take too long to put money into Americans’ pockets. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now. So this is now,” Mnuchin said. “This is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy, and we are going to use all the tools we have.” Governors across the country have closed restaurants, bars and other venues across their states as public health officials continue to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The White House released new guidelines Monday encouraging people not gather in groups larger than 10, work and take classes from home as much possible and avoid dining in bars, restaurants and food courts. President Donald Trump discussed on a call with restaurant executives Tuesday morning the important role drive-thru and delivery options can play as Americans adjust to their new normal while the nation grapples with the global pandemic. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 5,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing is made available. More than 90 people have died. Mnuchin, who left the White House briefing early for meetings on Capitol Hill, said he would preview the plan at a lunch with Senate Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed sending every American $1,000 and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has signaled support for a similar proposal to provide immediate economic relief to American families. “I think it’s clear we don’t need to send people who make $1 million a year checks,” Mnuchin said. “That’s one of the ideas that we like. We’re going to preview that today, and then we’ll be talking about details afterwards.”  Mnuchin also announced that Treasury would defer an additional $100 billion in Internal Revenue Service payments, bringing the total to $300 billion. Individuals can defer up to $1 million, Mnuchin said, while corporations can defer up to $10 million. The deferments are interest- and penalty-free for 90 days. Still, Mnuchin encouraged as many Americans as possible to file their taxes by the April 15 deadline to ensure those who are eligible receive their refunds in a timely manner. “We don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. “We want you to make sure you get them. Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.” It’s also possible that trading hours could be reduced at the nation’s stock markets given the economic damage of the coronavirus, Mnuchin said, cautioning that the goal was to keep exchanges open to maintain confidence. While stocks edged upward early in the afternoon Tuesday, repeated selloffs in recent weeks have raised the question of whether exchanges will remain open as the damage continues. “Americans need to know they have access to their money,” Mnuchin said. But “we may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that’s something they need to do.” Trump, whose rhetoric and tone has notably shifted in recent days to reflect the the seriousness of the situation, claimed he always knew “this was real — this was a pandemic,” despite repeatedly downplaying the threat of the coronavirus. He also acknowledged that there could be a 100 percent chance the coronavirus plunges the nation into a recession. “It could be,” he said, insisting he doesn’t think in terms of recession or not. “When we are finished with the virus, we will win. When that victory takes place, our economy will go through the roof. It is so pent up, so built up, it is so ready to go in an upward duration. We have to knock out this enemy.” Toby Eckert and Kellie Mejdrich contributed to this report.",Mnuchin: 'We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately',2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-government-payments-checks-133994,politico
"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion. Nothing is set in stone, but it will include around $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.” U.S. airports largely back U.S. airlines' request for cash, and are asking separately for $10 billion in aid — a number based on an expected 40 percent drop in revenues. “We need to be a part of whatever it is Congress and the administration try to get done here in the near term,” Joel Bacon, a lobbyist for the American Association of Airport Executives, told reporters on a call Tuesday afternoon. “We are quickly reaching a crisis point at airports across the country.” AAAE wants the $10 billion to “be made available to airports as quickly as possible and with as few strings attached as possible.” Bacon noted that airports have $100 billion in collective debt, and that $7 billion in debt and interest payments are due by the end of 2020. “I’m not suggesting that airports are going to shut down,” Bacon added. “What we are worried about is the ability to meet ongoing operational concerns and to pay for ongoing projects and existing debt.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"President Donald Trump punched back on Tuesday against criticism from Democratic governors critical of his administration's coronavirus response, wading into his familiar political spats as the White House looks to combat a pandemic. Trump referred to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as the ""failing Michigan governor"" on Monday and lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after his calls for stepped up federal assistance. Minutes later, he heaped praise on his own administration for ""working very well with the Governors and State officials."" While Cuomo, Whitmer and other governors have been among the most vocal critics of the federal coronavirus response, they have been far from alone. The Trump administration has come under a steady drumbeat of scrutiny over its inability to quickly ramp up coronavirus testing capabilities as well as its weekslong rhetorical campaign to downplay the virus' threat to Americans. Only recently has the president reversed course in his own public utterances to warn the public about the severity of the pandemic's threat. Although Trump and Cuomo sparred Tuesday on social media, it appeared the two made amends after a morning phone call. Not long after Cuomo praised the Trump administration for being ""responsive"" at a press conference on Tuesday, Trump told reporters at the White House press briefing that they were both ""doing a really good job."" ""We had a very good talk,"" Trump said. ""I think we are right there on the same track. It's going to be very successful."" But Trump didn't let up on Whitmer during Tuesday's press briefing — defending his attacks on the Michigan governor.  ""I only do that when I have to respond,"" the president said in response to a question about his criticism of Whitmer and other high profile Democrats. ""She said that will something that was false, and therefore I did do that, and I will continue to do that. If they're not going to play fair because, you know, they have the media on their side. I don't. I just have me. And if they are not going to play fair, I'm going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there's going to be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of bipartisanship.""  The president's criticism of Whitmer on Tuesday was triggered by her appearance on MSNBC, where she said her state is working to flatten the curve by closing restaurants and bars after a federal government response that did not take the outbreak “seriously early enough.” She also outlined her plan to expand unemployment benefits as workers lose jobs and are forced to stay home amid the pandemic.  “The federal government did not take this seriously early enough, and now it is on us to make sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science available and that we are always putting the health of our people front and center,” Whitmer said on MSNBC. Trump soon after tweeted that the Michigan governor ""must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!” During a White House news briefing on Monday, the president also suggested that state leaders work to obtain medical equipment like respirators and ventilators on their own because of the slow federal process — a suggestion Whitmer called ""mind-boggling.""  “We need federal support. Like I said, we’re pulling out all the stops and reaching out to our partners in the private sector,” Whitmer said. “We’re going to do everything we can to supplement. But it’s not to the exclusion of federal support. We need the federal government to ramp up and to get this done.”  The president's feud with Cuomo, which bubbled up again Tuesday, has simmered for days amid back-and-forth criticism between the two men over the Trump administration's coronavirus response. The New York governor has repeatedly called for more federal help, to which Trump has replied that it is Cuomo who needs to do more. On Tuesday, the president accused Cuomo of playing politics with his criticism of the administration and suggested that a blanket federal policy of the type that some have called for would not be appropriate. ""Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,"" Trump tweeted, referring to the novel coronavirus by a controversial name that some in his administration have adopted. ""New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it.”  Trump ended his tirade against the governors with the tweet praising the federal government’s work with state and local officials, promising that “Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS.”",Trump lashes out at Dem governors amid coronavirus coordination,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-whitmer-cuomo-coronavirus-response-133716,politico
"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.   The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return.   But since some Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.   Another concern for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans is a practical one — if they let the Senate adjourn following passage of the ""Phase 2"" House bill, it may be logistically difficult to get senators back to Washington once they go home because of travel hurdles. Airline service has been severely disrupted so far, and situation may worsen. In addition, if one or more senators contract the virus, returning to Washington may prove impossible.  But the idea of combing two stimulus packages will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.   The White House Tuesday morning began signaling it was aiming for $850 billion in stimulus spending, split between a payroll tax cut, support for the airline industry and $250 billion in loans for small business.   ""I don’t know how it happens exactly yet. I know that 'Phase Two' will kind of be the baseline approach and then we’ll try and go from there,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) on Tuesday.   ""There’s a third iteration that we’re working on and how it gets across the floor and back to the House remains to be seen. I mean they could move separately, but maybe there’s a way we combine it,” he said.  The House passed the $100 billion-plus ""Phase 2"" stimulus bill on late Friday night, but then had to amend the package Monday with significant ""technical corrections"" following discussions between Mnuchin, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).   The revised legislation — which provides paid sick days and emergency leave to workers who are ill or have family members with coronavirus — is set to be taken up the Senate this week.   Several senior Democratic aides said combining the two packages into one would be a nonstarter in the House without significant concessions.  House Democratic leaders are already dealing with rank-and-file anger over a “technical corrections” bill the House passed late Monday that actually included a significant rewrite to the paid leave language in a major concession to the White House. The change — which would allow more businesses to seek exemptions from offering their employees paid leave — was pushed by administration officials as necessary to get the bill through the Senate, according to multiple sources. But now, if the House-passed bill is combined with a huge economic package, they didn’t even need to make that major change, House Democratic aides argued.  Pelosi appeared to address the criticism from some in her caucus in a statement on Tuesday, in which she vowed to push for expanded paid leave in the next package.  ""As the House develops our third Families First package, we are working to advance additional steps to expand the emergency leave mandate,"" Pelosi wrote, laying out several provisions, including allowing workers who are sick to access longer term leave.  In addition, several Democrats said the payroll tax cut was still a nonstarter, citing tepid support for the idea even among Republicans. And they threw cold water on the idea of just cutting checks to people, saying the bureaucracy needed to implement such a massive program could delay payments for weeks if not longer.  “All this stuff can come together fairly quickly,” said one Democrat involved in the negotiations. “The question is what are ideas that can come together fairly quickly? Something new like direct payments to people isn’t feasible.”  Democratic aides said they were instead looking at other ways to pad people’s wallets by expanding credits already written into the tax code.

"Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, has tested negative for coronavirus, a party spokesman announced on Wednesday, just days after she displayed flu-like symptoms following a trip to Mar-a-Lago. “On the advice of her doctor, @GOPChairwoman was administered a test for COVID-19. That test has fortunately come back negative,” Michael Ahrens, the RNC communications director, posted on Twitter. McDaniel had come down with symptoms on Friday after attending a fundraiser at President Donald Trump’s private club in Florida last week. A number of officials and foreign visitors had exhibited symptoms after visiting the club in the past month. Trump hosted a delegation from Brazil, including President Jair Bolsonaro, at the club last week, a number of whom tested positive for coronavirus and had direct contact with Trump. The White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley, announced last Friday that a person seated at Trump’s dining table had tested positive, but that the risk of infection was low for the president. Trump tested negative for the virus, the White House announced on Saturday morning. Bolsonaro posted on Facebook that he had also tested negative for the virus. Several of Trump’s closest associates and aides have gone into self-quarantine after coming in contact with the Brazilian delegation or otherwise engaging with people at Mar-a-Lago.

"Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, sought to pre-empt questions about Sanders’ future by sending a statement to reporters Wednesday morning implying he has no immediate plans to drop out.  It didn’t work as planned. Instead, after the Vermont senator lost Florida, Illinois and Arizona by double digits, he spent his Wednesday shooting down rumors about his campaign folding, canceling all of his digital ad spending, and lashing out at a reporter who asked about what he often refers to as “political gossip.” Sanders’ campaign had hoped he could pull off an upset in just one state that voted on Tuesday. Having fallen short of that mark, Shakir’s statement attempted to buy some time for the campaign as it assessed its future. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” he said. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.” In an email to supporters, Shakir was even more blunt. “No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,” he said. After likely voting on coronavirus legislation, he said, Sanders would fly from Washington to his home in Burlington, Vt., where he would ""begin holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign."" One ally whom Sanders’ campaign reached out to Tuesday was Scott Slawson, president of the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America Local 506, which has worked closely with the campaign. Slawson spoke at Sanders’ kickoff rally last March, and Sanders talked about his union members at a CNN town hall. He argued Sanders should stay in the race. “There’s still a lot of states that got to weigh in. I think you got to do your due diligence and stay in till the end at this point,” he said. “I know that he’s got a pretty big following in Pennsylvania. There’s a lot of delegates still hanging out there.” Even so, Sanders’ nosedive has led to intense questioning from the media about the future of his campaign, culminating in an inaccurate report on Axios that said he was suspending it. And the wall of pressure from centrist Democrats to abandon his bid for the White House has only intensified after his losses Tuesday. Both factors are likely to aggravate Sanders, who has long brawled with moderates and the news media. “This campaign’s over. He needs to acknowledge that and be gracious about it,” said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way. “Not only for party unity, which is up to him, but just for the sake of humanity, it would be better for him to wrap this up.” As he weighs his options, many of Sanders’ aides and allies are urging him to press forward, even if it is nearly impossible to win the nomination at this point. They see a benefit for him in trying to push Joe Biden to the left and continuing to grow the progressive movement. “The campaign is so useful for building lists, leadership and organizational infrastructure that I think it’d be a big blow for the left if he dropped out any time before the convention,” a Sanders aide said. David Segal, executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress, co-wrote a Wednesday op-ed that argued Sanders should not drop out. He said he was speaking for himself and not the organization. “The alternative is an intentional, monthslong process where Bernie and Biden actually come to a deeper consensus and unity around a set of issues and especially around personnel,” he told POLITICO. “It’s important that you actually have a coming-together that feels more real than the last one in 2016.” Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the progressive political action committee Democracy for America, said that while Sanders’ path to the nomination is “significantly steeper” after Tuesday, “the reality is this is a contest that has changed overnight repeatedly throughout the entire primary, and no one really knows what’s going to happen moving forward.” Sanders, he said, had time to figure out his next steps: “The next contest isn’t for weeks, so I think we’ve got a lot of time.” Sanders’ staffers did not provide a time frame on when he would make his decision. Mike Casca, Sanders’ communications director, said “his head really is in the coronavirus response.” Sanders’ concern with the pandemic sweeping the world was evident on Wednesday, when he snapped at a reporter who asked about timing on his decision. “I’m dealing with a f---ing global crisis,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. ""Right now, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that we don't have an economic meltdown and that people don't die. Is that enough for you to keep me busy for today?"" On Wednesday, Sanders’ campaign canceled all digital ads, including online fundraising spots he launched just on Tuesday. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser, insisted that they pulled the ads because it is unclear when the next primaries will be held as states postpone elections because of the coronavirus. “We make ad spending decisions based on many criteria,” he said. “One of the most important is when the election in a state is happening because advertising is most effective closer to Election Day. Primary dates are all moving back and our ad spending reflects that.” Other presidential candidates who have pulled their advertising and said they were reevaluating their campaigns have often withdrawn within hours. But at least one hasn’t followed that path: Sanders. In April 2016, his senior strategist, Tad Devine, said Sanders was reassessing his campaign after a string of losses to Hillary Clinton made it virtually impossible for him to win the nomination. A day later, his campaign announced that it was laying off hundreds of staff and zeroing in on winning delegate-rich California. This year, Sanders does not have California to look forward to after he won the Golden State on Super Tuesday. But his aides have thought he would have a good chance in New York, which casts ballots on April 28 and already has Sanders staff. As a son of Brooklyn, the state also holds an emotional significance for him. But 2020 and 2016 are different in important ways. Sanders personally likes Biden and badly wants to defeat Trump. Because of the coronavirus epidemic, Sanders also cannot hold the large rallies that project excitement and energy, and that he personally enjoys. While the result on Tuesday further deflated Sanders’ supporters, progressives surveying the map nevertheless found one major sign of progress in their movement. As Sanders was getting shellacked in Illinois, incumbent Rep. Dan Lipinski, a Democrat known for his opposition to abortion rights and Obamacare, was felled by Marie Newman, a progressive who supports Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Unlike Sanders, Newman was able to unite left-wing activists like the Justice Democrats and more traditional liberal groups such as EMILY’s List. She also carried Sanders’ endorsement. “This is now the third incumbent that has been beaten by a Justice Democrats progressive in the last cycle and a half,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant who advised Cynthia Nixon in her primary campaign against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2018. “It’s a big win, and it also shows what happens when the left comes together.”","Bernie’s rough day after

"House Democrats are drafting a new stimulus bill to address the coronavirus pandemic — legislation designed as their counter-offer to a trillion-dollar package currently being assembled in the Republican-controlled Senate.  On a private call Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed her leadership team and committee chairs to begin further efforts to address the looming economic disaster caused by the growing coronavirus crisis.  The House Democratic plan will incorporate proposals from several panels and is expected to include additional unemployment insurance payments, expanded Medicaid coverage, an airline rescue package, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, and additional food security measures, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides.  “Time is of the essence, and the House will move swiftly to protect public health and provide relief for the American people,” Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday.   Each House committee will submit their own plans to Pelosi, who will compile a large-scale relief package in the coming days. Pelosi and her top deputies plan to review the ideas with Democrats — who are working from their districts this week — on a conference call Thursday afternoon.  Democratic sources cautioned, however, that their proposal won’t be formally finished until next week. And it’s still unclear if Pelosi intends to bring the House back to vote or just use the Democratic initiative as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Senate and President Donald Trump.  At times, the call showed the stress facing even lawmakers, as they attempt to hammer out next steps: Pelosi and House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), for instance, had a tense exchange during the call over whether the 2008 Wall Street bailout focused too heavily on big banks and not enough on average Americans, a point both lawmakers made, according to multiple sources who were listening. A source close to Pelosi downplayed the exchange.  Pelosi’s move comes as House Democrats have essentially been locked out of high-stakes negotiations over the so-called “Phase 3” coronavirus relief package. The White House — through Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and top Senate Republicans are rushing to draft a trillion-dollar measure that will help keep airlines and small businesses afloat. Mnuchin and Senate Republicans are also considering a $500 billion plan to send direct cash payments to millions of Americans. The Kentucky Republican is hoping to unveil a GOP position on this new package as early as Thursday, and then enter into discussions with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Senate Democrats have floated their own $750 billion economic package that includes hundreds of billions in spending to help Americans in economic distress.  McConnell has made clear he wants to deal with Schumer alone, not both Democratic leaders.   ""I anticipate what I've said repeatedly, which is we're in a process of deciding exactly where we are and where the administration is — and then we obviously intend to sit down with Sen. Schumer,"" McConnell told CNN. ""And I'm sure he will keep the speaker in the loop and we'll move to getting a bipartisan agreement.""  Speaking to her leadership team, Pelosi argued that the “fastest way to get a third package finished by early next week” is for all four senior congressional leaders to sit down and negotiate together, according to an aide on the call. Schumer also made the same argument on the Senate floor Wednesday.  Pelosi is in a race against time as McConnell and GOP leaders have vowed to move the third tranche of recovery legislation through the Senate at “warp speed.” McConnell needs 60 votes to pass any legislation, and House Democrats are concerned he could pick off some Senate Democrats and move a bill through that chamber that they don’t support — leaving them in a difficult position both politically and policy wise.  Pelosi spoke to both Mnuchin and McConnell separately on Tuesday about the next package. But McConnell has rejected Pelosi’s idea of a “four corners” negotiation that includes the quartet of party leaders in both chambers. Schumer has also called for a “four corners” negotiation.  Democratic sources with knowledge of Pelosi’s move said it’s important that they lay down a marker of what proposals the House will and won’t accept, even if they’re not directly in the room with McConnell.   Even Senate Democrats have complained that they’ve been boxed out of the talks in the early stages of legislation that is likely to exceed a trillion dollars. “Republicans have not consulted any Democrats as to what we want in there,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said during a press conference on Wednesday, when asked about the state of talks on the third package. “Right now, they are doing this from their side only.”  The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a multi-billion-dollar aid bill that moved through the House last week. The bill, known as “Phase 2,” expands safety net programs including paid sick leave, unemployment insurance and food assistance to help Americans impacted by the coronavirus. Congress previously passed legislation to bolster the public health system.  Pelosi has said the House and Senate should consider refundable tax credits, expanded unemployment insurance and direct payments. But the California Democrat has been firm that any of the proposals “MUST be targeted,” her spokesman Drew Hammill wrote on Twitter this week.  Pelosi led the negotiations on the second bill, consulting with Mnuchin dozens of times via phone last week as the two worked to quickly hammer out the legislation. McConnell deferred to Mnuchin on the talks but has taken control of the negotiations of the latest legislation.  Congressional leaders are hoping to act quickly to pass the “Phase 3” package both to try to steady the financial markets, which continue to be in a tailspin as the long-term impacts of the virus remain unknown, and to limit the potential exposure lawmakers have to the coronavirus. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) announced Wednesday he had become the first lawmaker to test positive with the virus.",Pelosi looks to lay down marker on next stimulus plan,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/nancy-pelosi-coronavirus-stimulus-plan-136142,politico
"Probably for most of us, the coronavirus crisis will soon enough—Six months? A year?—recede in our minds and come to seem like a hallucinatory moment. Maybe it will be like a hurricane that forced everyone to rush inland and then only glanced the coast.  Or maybe it will be like a hurricane that really does hit. Even then, human nature being what it is, most people will clean up and move on. Yet no matter how the coronavirus pandemic passes, or how quickly, there is likely in these strange housebound weeks a new political epoch being born. There are two large reasons to believe the political echo of this crisis will last much longer than the crisis itself. The first is that many of the people whose expectations and routines are most dramatically upended by the pandemic are students. The interruption, and in some cases irreplaceable loss, of important experiences in their education, as campuses empty and untold events are canceled, will likely shape their consciousness in more lasting ways than for the rest of us. Like most catastrophes, the pandemic’s malign consequences will fall most heavily on the underprivileged. Unlike most catastrophes, its costs are also being paid heavily by some segments of the most privileged. Those college seniors whose spring terms and graduation ceremonies are suddenly deleted include many people who are future leaders of the public and private sectors. No, it’s not the end of the world for them. But it’s a piercing loss even so—one being paid more for the benefit of older, less healthy people than for pure self-protection. More profoundly, the dynamics of the coronavirus moment likely will resemble the dynamics of other great public policy issues shadowing the next generation. In particular, the global pandemic and the harsh choices it imposes offer—in highly concentrated fashion in coming months—much the same choices that responses to global climate change will impose in coming decades. Like the coronavirus emergency, climate change is a problem whose dimensions are largely the province of scientific experts—employing complex data models aimed at illuminating future trends that the average citizen can understand in broad concept but not in detail. The essential question: Do you trust these experts, or not? Like the coronavirus, climate change is a problem for which remedies are not solely the province of experts but are primarily the realm of community values. These remedies involve tangible and immediate costs for benefits that are abstract and imponderable.  In the case of coronavirus, for instance, the shutdown of the economy required by enforcing social distancing imposes costs that are immediate and quite likely already in your midst—layoffs of someone you know, uncertainty about future income, concern for a favorite neighborhood business about to go under. As to the benefits, meanwhile, no one knows—certainly not now, maybe not ever. Perhaps the massive response won’t really be effective and a public health catastrophe unfolds anyway. Or maybe the response in retrospect will seem overblown. In the case of climate change, the tension between immediate certain consequences—whether paying a carbon tax or substantially altering consumption habits—for diffuse and distant benefits is more acute. The rewards for the deep and comprehensive changes needed to replace a carbon-fueled economy and halt the warming of the planet will be enjoyed—one hopes—primarily by people not yet born. Finally, of course, coronavirus is like climate change in the sense that it is impervious to national borders. One way to gauge the power of these currents—crisis fueled by frightening science—is by watching the change in President Donald Trump. There is no way to know for certain what the coronavirus means for his reelection. But already it is evident what it has meant for Trumpism. It has sent it hurtling into retreat. Trumpism as an idea is about promoting and protecting American sovereignty and singularity. In some contexts, even Trump foes might agree it’s an attractive concept: Well might we wish to seal our borders from the virus. But the only way this would be effective would be if the United States had years ago opted to adjourn from the modern interconnected global economy. Yes, the coronavirus first presented itself in China. How many people were surprised to learn only in the past few weeks that nearly all U.S. antibiotics also come from China. Trumpism as a style is defined not just by boasting and bluster; his triumphalism depends on projecting certitude. The president early on acted as if he could indeed create reality by proclamation, when he assured the public that U.S. infections would soon be down to zero. Only in recent days, as the possibility of widespread domestic disease mounts, has Trump acknowledged imprecision—the fragmentary nature of our understanding of how far the virus has spread, how effective efforts to blunt its impact will be, or when these efforts will be deemed sufficient.  One way to appreciate the murkiness of our circumstances—and the moral implications of this murkiness—is to view them through the eyes of young people. No need to overstate things. Missing spring semester is not the same as dodging sniper fire in Kabul, nor the same as being laid off from your job handling bags at O’Hare.  But nor should one understate things. Suppose baseball has been your consuming passion since age 6 and now at 22 you are expecting one last idyll as team captain. Now that season will never happen. Maybe you were planning to spend the semester in Peru and are now scrambling to see if you can find a flight home. Planes and restaurants will fill up again. In all likelihood that semester abroad is gone for good. Psych 101 perhaps can be taken remotely; the exhilarating 1 a.m. conversation in the dorm lounge will not be.  Out of curiosity, I read various college and university presidents’ letters announcing the closure of their campuses. Most were filled with the same kind of bromides as your workplace or mine offered about caring first and foremost for the health and etc., etc., of our community. One letter, by Williams College president Maud Mandel, stuck out for its candor: “A healthy person could reasonably choose to stay and accept the personal risk of catching COVID-19, but the decision would unacceptably increase the chance of contagion for others.” Indeed, that 21-year-old might plausibly calculate, even if he or she gets sick the chances are, not for everybody but for most, that it would be a miserable few days rather than life-threatening illness. Those institutions closed less to protect their campus communities than to protect the broader society. The coronavirus pandemic does not remotely have the cataclysmic shock and violence of 9/11. For many people, however, the virus’ actual day-in, day-out impact will be more pervasive. 9-11 was followed by a period, which turned out to be short-lived, of national connection and goodwill. Trump, who has made mockery and castigation of opponents his signature, surely did not conjure fuzzy feelings from many quarters with his appeal at the White House on Wednesday that, “We are all in this together.” Yet the pandemic has a logic that transcends politics and personal feeling. Never mind how one feels about Trump. Never mind how we feel about one another. The reality of a dangerous virus is that we are all in this together. ",The Pandemic is the End of Trumpism,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/the-coronavirus-generation-comes-to-life-136491,politico
"Hospitals are struggling to find enough doctors, nurses and other health care workers to care for mounting numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients. The staffing problems are on top of the equipment problems — the lack of ICU beds, ventilators, and masks and other protective equipment needed to prevent the healers from becoming patients. Hospitals are taking extraordinary measures to bulk up the workforce, from calling on retirees for help to assigning medical students to answer the phones. The Trump administration on Wednesday announced new rules that would let doctors practice across state lines, without going through layers of recertification and licensing. And CMS is releasing recommendations on limiting non-essential elective procedures, which will also free up personnel and resources — although hospitals, which rely on some revenue-producing elective procedures, raised alarms over the weekend over how to define “elective care.” “They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines,” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma at a White House press briefing Wednesday. The VA is also preparing to help bolster the civilian health care system. But the numbers of physicians is finite — and older ones, as well as those with their own health conditions, are at risk from Covid-19. The problem is compounded by the infectious nature of the disease, which is exposing dozens of frontline workers who need to self quarantine if they have the virus. Some have already fallen ill. “Dozens of frontline caregivers in the United States have been exposed,” wrote two Harvard University medical students Adam Beckman and Suhas Gondi and Yale University health policy expert Howard Forman on the Health Affairs blog Wednesday. “This trend will accelerate in the coming weeks and months, as health care workers increasingly come into contact with patients with Covid-19 and shortages of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) worsen.” Hospitals will have to figure out how to steer any surging workforce, who should concentrate on coronavirus patients and who should take care of people who still come in with other serious diseases and injuries. And some community physicians, who may not have been in an ICU since their training but want to lend a hand, say they haven’t gotten a lot of guidance. Hospitals are taking a sweeping look at how they can boost their staff — and already retired doctors have offered step up if they can easily renew their licenses and admitting privileges. “It’s all hands on deck — especially well-educated clinical hands,” said Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association’s vice president for quality and patient safety policy. She said some hospitals have reached out to medical and nursing schools asking who can “offer extra hands.” Widespread school closures have also created problems for medical workers — as well as other hospital personnel including food service and the crews who more than ever who have to clean and disinfect — with kids now at home with no one else to take care of them. Some facilities are creating on-site child care facilities and also subsidizing these services, as the AHA and America’s Essential Hospitals call on more dollars from Congress to help. “As they start closing schools down … it creates downward pressure on the availability of staff,” said Alan Levine, CEO of Ballad Health, which has more than 20 hospitals serving rural Tennessee and Virginia. “We lose some of our nurses and health care manpower.” The Association of American Medical Colleges called on med schools to bar students from their clinical work with patients for two weeks — and some students are instead performing telehealth screenings or babysitting the children of doctors and nurses, so they can go to work. Meanwhile, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is asking medical, nursing and public health schools for detailed information on how many students and staff could pitch in, and what their specialties are. At Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, staffing is the primary concern. They have two coronavirus teams of six staff each — and contingency plans for freeing up more staff, while also working with the other hospitals in the city on how to manage an influx of patients. Some doctors say they are ready to help — even if they aren’t pulmonologists or ICU doctors, they can still care for patients, freeing up colleagues to concentrate on the pandemic. But it’s not at all clear that hospitals have figured out how exactly to pull these levers. The American Nurses Association suggested that nurses with inactive licenses, school nurses and senior nursing students can take on roles like helping out at drive-thru testing sites or long-term care facilities. Rural areas haven’t been hit as hard yet as their urban counterparts in places like New York, the Seattle area, and parts of California. But they already are seeing boosts in patients and workforce shortages. Their hospitals are already very lean, and a lot of the physicians are older, meaning they have their own coronavirus risks. And 48 percent of rural hospitals operate on a loss, according to the National Rural Health Association, making any surge in patients particularly difficult. “In a small rural hospital, each employee wears several different hats, and if you lose just one of those, it’s like you’re losing a couple different employees, and soon the facility will be unable to function,” said Maggie Elehwany, the association's government affairs and policy vice president. For instance: In Indiana, one rural health member relayed to the national association that two staff members are quarantined, while the hospital is running low on money. They have four EMS personnel on staff, and are unsure how they would make up for the staffing loss if those front line workers have to self isolate. But worries over the fast-moving coronavirus don’t stop at staffing shortages. “We’re actually rather desperate for help right now,” said Cassie Sauer, president and CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association, where one of the most severe outbreaks is taking place. “We’re asking the navy to send a Navy Ship up here from San Diego — a medical ship — we’re asking for field hospitals, we’re asking for the National Guard, we’re asking for a release of the national strategic stockpile for PPE.” President Donald Trump did deploy two hospital ships on Wednesday though not necessarily to Seattle. Shortages of personal protective equipment, bed capacity and key lifesaving equipment are mounting as more and more confirmed coronavirus cases crop up around the country. Washington State Hospital Association is calling on other industries, such as dentists, veterinarians and even automakers, to share their supplies of personal protective equipment. Levine said Ballad Health ordered more ventilators, but estimates they will take eight to 10 weeks to arrive. “Italy bought them up,” he said. He’s considering reopening one shuttered hospital as a Covid-19 hub — but will have to staff it. The Ohio Hospital Association is talking to local nursing homes about using an empty wing or a building to treat non-coronavirus patients safely, freeing up hospital rooms for Covid-19 patients. They may even turn to floors of hotels for the less seriously ill patients. University of California San Francisco has converted a floor of its largest facility, which has 600 beds, to an environment that can house coronavirus patients. The hospital has about two weeks of personal masks, gowns and gloves on hand, and is treating about 40 per day – and testing about 100 more. Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act, which puts the economy on a wartime footing against the virus. The VA is also preparing to share both medical personnel and equipment to shore up a civilian health care system about to face unprecedented demands. But there’s still uncertainty for how much further the health care system will be pushed — and if it’ll reach a breaking point. “I think there’s a lot we don’t know and I know that there are folks out there modeling scenarios,” Beth Feldpush, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at America’s Essential Hospitals. Debra Kahn, Susannah Luthi and Alice Miranda Ollstein contributed.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act to get medical equipment to hospitals in the fight against the coronavirus. But don't expect new masks, ventilators, gloves and goggles to show up in the field right away. The Trump administration has yet to complete a comprehensive assessment, despite weeks of discussion about using the act to help prevent the medical system from being overrun, according to current and former administration officials. Even Trump said on Wednesday that he's in no hurry to order the supplies. In an executive order issued Wednesday afternoon, Trump granted authority primarily to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to determine “the proper nationwide priorities” and to allocate all necessary health and medical resources and services. Azar will work with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, the order says. “To ensure that our healthcare system is able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is critical that all health and medical resources needed … are properly distributed to the Nation's healthcare system and others that need them most at this time,” the order says. Invoking the DPA means that if the government places an order with a private company for any medical equipment to treat the coronavirus — masks and ventilators are the two prime examples — then that company would be required to fulfill the government’s order before anyone else’s. But while it gives the government priority, invoking the act does not do anything to increase production of these items, which increasingly are in short supply. “It doesn’t help capacity,” said Doug Jacobson, an international export-control lawyer in Washington. “If you only have capacity to produce X number of units, it doesn’t help that. It just simply reprioritizes where the supply chain is oriented to.” A White House spokesperson didn't respond when asked whether the administration is positioned to immediately begin placing orders with private companies, or what those orders would might like. And Trump followed up the order with a tweet in which he indicated that he is in no rush to use the authorities. ""I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!"" Lawmakers and former government officials who have been responsible for disaster preparedness and participated in exercises to game out responses in such national crises expressed alarm at the seemingly blasé approach. ""The government should be placing purchasing orders for this equipment and they should know what they are asking for,"" said Katrina Mulligan, former director for preparedness and response in the National Security Division of the Justice Department and former member of the National Security Council staff. ""And right now, it appears that neither of those things are happening."" “They have not done this assessment,"" said Mulligan, who is managing director of national security and international policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""It is shocking. It is malpractice.” Taking full advantage of the authorities by definition poses significant challenges. ""It’s been used, but not like this,” said Kelly Magsamen, a former Pentagon official and National Security Council staffer in the Bush and Obama administrations. “It’s a pretty big step."" She, too, said it remains unclear how quickly the powers can now be set in motion most effectively and efficiently. ""So far, we haven’t seen the White House actually issue any orders to manufacturers,"" Magsamen said. ""That’s the next step. They have to issue orders so that the private sector and manufacturers can figure out how to fill them. The White House has to do its own homework in terms of assessing its ventilator reserves, which hopefully is underway. ""Somebody in the federal government needs to be doing that assessment so that you can have an informed ask of the manufacturing community,"" she added. “I’m hoping they’ve been working on it for some time."" Chris Brooks, chief strategy officer for Seattle-area Ventec Life Systems, said he's fielding inquiries and orders from more than 60 countries, including the U.S. government. But with the U.S., he said the focus is still on working out what exactly it needs. “I want to say we’re doing everything we can to ramp up as quickly as possible and to put products in place to be able to make as many [ventilators] as possible,” he said. “Certainly, with a definitive answer about what that need is, we could provide a definitive answer as to whether we could meet that need.” Mulligan said what is required is ""a 50-state breakdown of how many days of personal protective equipment do you have, where your gaps are the biggest."" Then, she added, ""you would identify the manufacturers domestically who produce those items. Do you have the capacity to do more within your current manufacturing capacity? Can you ramp up production? For the last month, we could have been figuring these questions out. There is absolutely no reason why we are starting that now."" In fact, talk of invoking the Defense Production Act to help deal with the current crisis dates back at least to late February. ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting,"" Azar told reporters on Feb. 2. ""So that is an authority that we have, and we intend to use it to acquire anything that we need to acquire."" Azar said he could not specify all the items it will be used to produce but noted, ""of course, we've been very clear in the supplemental of the core items that we've got to do, which is personal protective equipment."" That includes protective equipment for health care workers. ""We've spoken of procuring at least 300 million N95 masks,"" Azar said. ""We need additional gowns ... as well as gloves. So that kind of personal protective equipment most immediately."" Azar also stressed that ""if we need to, we will use it. We won't hesitate."" Trump on Wednesday defended the timing. ""Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators, too,"" he told reporters. ""And when we have thousands of ventilators — it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing."" Others have been pressing the administration to ramp up its special authorities more quickly. ""America is not as ready as we should be,"" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, who co-wrote a letter this week to Trump pressing him to utilize the DPA. ""In France, factories that once manufactured fancy perfumes are starting to churn out needed hand sanitizer instead,"" he said. ""You can’t do these things overnight. It takes planning and coordination. President Trump is finally taking needed steps, but we’ve got to do more."" There could be other delays, however.

"A specter haunts progressive America—the possibility that a private company might make too much money solving the world’s coronavirus problem. True to form, Bernie Sanders expressed this worry in the crudest and most simplistic terms at the last Democratic debate, calling the leaders of the pharmaceutical industry “a bunch of crooks,” who are saying to themselves in the midst of the epidemic, “Wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.” Op-eds have sprung up warning, “Drug Companies Will Make a Killing from Coronavirus” (The New York Times) and “How Big Pharma Will Profit from the Coronavirus” (The Intercept).  This would seem the least of our problems right now, but the pharmaceutical industry has become such a boogeyman that it gets roundly attacked even while racing to provide an indisputable boon to public health.  Bernie’s view that the people running the drug companies are “crooks” betrays his Marxoid belief that profit is a form of theft. Of course, even people who aren’t socialists stuck in amber circa 1930 are great scourges of the industry. Pharma brought much of this on itself with the opioid debacle, which was the product of genuine abuses. Yet these companies routinely create medical miracles for which we all should be grateful and that markedly improve human welfare.  Yes, they make money doing it, but the profit motive is the reason why they exist in the first place.  There’s a reason we introduce more new therapies than any country in the world. When faced with what’s been called a once-in-generation pathogen, would we rather have a robust commercial drug industry or not? Brilliant, creative people scattered throughout companies and universities working to be the first to a solution or not? Investors looking to back promising research, or not?  If your answer to any of these questions is “no,” you are probably a socialist, a populist firing at the wrong targets, or someone incapable of doing basic cost-benefit calculations.  As Chris Pope of the Manhattan Institute notes, if a new drug—even an expensive one—obviates hospital stays and physician care, it can reduce health care costs over time.  Consider the current crisis. The costs of the “medieval” methods we are using to try to control the coronavirus virus are unimaginably high—shutting down swaths of the economy, throwing millions out of work, disrupting air travel and the free movement of people. Gross domestic product could drop 5 percent or more this quarter.  What would we pay for a vaccine to make this all unnecessary? Even if it were a trillion dollars, the price of the Trump-proposed stimulus package, it would be a bargain, saving untold human suffering and economic dislocation. Even if it required cutting a check directly to the most stereotypical mustache-twirling, profiteering-in-a-crisis, uncaring businessman it would be a great deal.  That said, the price for a vaccine probably won’t be exorbitant. The nightmare stories of ungodly expensive treatments usually involve drugs for rare diseases. In these cases, there is a very small base of people who potentially need the drug. Companies therefore charge higher prices to recoup research costs and make a profit. Also, there are unlikely to be any competitors providing a cheaper alternative.  With the coronavirus, there’s an incredibly vast pool of people who will want the vaccine, meaning it can be priced accordingly. Since so many companies are chasing a vaccine, there will almost certainly be competition, putting further downward pressure on the price.  The overall picture of prescription drugs is more complicated than advertised. Chris Pope writes that prescription drugs account for a lower percentage of overall health spending here than in most other advanced countries, and the per capita cost for hospital services has been rising at a much more rapid clip in recent years than the per capita price of prescription drugs. Once new drugs come off patent, cheaper generic drugs arrive. This is why per capita spending on traditional drugs has been declining.  As for patents, the point of them is, as the Constitution puts it, “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” They ensure that companies get the benefit of research that is expensive, time consuming and risky. Success is never guaranteed, and failure more common. Even in the best circumstance, after perhaps spending $2 billion or more on the research process, a company may wait 10 years or more for approval from the Food and Drug Administration.  If a company doesn’t have a period of protection for its intellectual property when it can reap the market benefits, much of this research would dry up. And who’s going to step up and fill the gap?  It’s true that the government provides support for basic research through the National Institutes of Health. That is well and good—and an entirely worthy government project—but it’s not the same as bringing a drug to market.  It is a marvel that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is already working with a Cambridge, Mass., company, Moderna, on a vaccine trail. This is a model of public-private cooperation. Anyone who would want to subtract Moderna from the process because it stands to profit from its work is an ideological zealot heedless of public health.  Drug pricing is a complicated matter and there are, to be sure, more things that the government can be doing to foster competition and keep companies from gaming the system. But this crisis brings home the incalculable value of a world-class pharmaceutical sector. We can shelter in place and try to mitigate the harms of this virus, or hope the “crooks” pursuing treatments and a vaccine make the current disruptions in our national life a thing of the past as soon possible.",Only the ‘Crooks’ of the Pharmaceutical Industry Can Save Us Now,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/only-the-crooks-of-the-pharmaceutical-industry-can-save-us-now-136255,politico
"Coronavirus has finally reached Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a ninth-term Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, a freshman Democrat from Utah, revealed on Wednesday that they had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first U.S. lawmakers to contract the virus that‘s spreading across the country. Diaz-Balart, 58, said he began to develop symptoms on Saturday, just hours after he left the House floor for a vote on a coronavirus response bill. More than 400 members of Congress also voted during the early-Saturday session. Diaz-Balart’s statement indicates he decided to “self-quarantine in Washington D.C.” after the vote. His statement doesn’t indicate why he believed he needed to self-quarantine before developing symptoms or whether he informed staff or other members of Congress that he might have exposed them to the illness. “I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” Diaz-Balart said in the statement. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.” McAdams, 45, also said his symptoms began mildly on Saturday night, after he had returned to Utah. He immediately began self-quarantining on the advice of his doctor. “My symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough and labored breathing and I remained self-quarantined,“ McAdams said in a statement. “On Tuesday, my doctor instructed me to get tested for COVID-19 and following his referral, I went to the local testing clinic for the test. Today I learned that I tested positive.“ Diaz-Balart said he decided to remain in Washington on Saturday because he was concerned about being in his South Florida home, where his wife, who has a pre-existing condition, would be “at exceptionally high risk.” Like Diaz-Balart, McAdams didn‘t indicate whether he had urged any of his colleagues or aides to self-quarantine. The news of two members testing positive has already begun rippling across Congress. Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.) said on Wednesday night that the House doctor had advised him to self-quarantine until March 27 because he “was in contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19.“ The House minority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), said on Wednesday that he, too, would self-quarantine because he had held an “extended meeting“ with Diaz-Balart late last week. Scalise is now the highest-ranking lawmaker to self-quarantine amid the outbreak. Though Diaz-Balart and McAdams are the first in Congress to develop coronavirus, the illness has struck among a small number of congressional aides. It’s sure to heighten already-acute fears on Capitol Hill that members themselves, particularly the high proportion of elderly lawmakers, are vulnerable when they meet in Washington. The development appears likely to revive an internal House debate about whether to permit remote voting for lawmakers amid a pandemic that‘s ravaging the country, pummeling the economy and limiting members‘ ability to travel across the country. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have resisted the idea, worrying that it would set a damaging precedent for the future and signal a lack of confidence from government in the country‘s fight against coronavirus. But with two lawmakers ill and untold others exposed, some lawmakers say it‘s time to think again. “In. Person. Voting. Should. Be. Reconsidered,“ Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a freshman Democrat from Florida, said in a tweet late Wednesday. “For the safety of our communities, during this emergency, we must be able to legislate from our districts.“ Earlier in the day, 50 lawmakers of both parties wrote to House leaders asking them to reconsider remote voting as well, arguing that Congress must hold itself to the same standards it‘s asking of other Americans.",First 2 members of Congress test positive for coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/first-member-of-congress-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-136300,politico
"The Trump administration is considering a controversial proposal to boost the number of visas offered to wealthy immigrants who invest money in the United States as it tries to boost a faltering economy amid the escalating coronavirus outbreak, according to four people familiar with the situation. The proposal, which could be included in one of the Senate’s coronavirus rescue bills, would significantly boost the number of visas offered annually from 10,000 to 75,000 while halving the investment required to earn legal residence from $900,000 to $450,000, they say.  Half the recipients of the EB-5 visa program — investors and their families — come from China, according to a report by the Brookings Institution think tank. Many others come from South Korea and Taiwan. Immigration hardliners, who are generally supportive of President Donald Trump’s policies, oppose the proposal because of concerns about increasing the number of foreigners coming to the U.S., especially from China, which Trump blames for its handling of the coronavirus. “Using a coronavirus package to give more green cards to shady investors from the country where the virus originated would be Washington at its worst,” said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, who has been in touch with the White House and the Senate about the proposal. “If an immigration proposal doesn’t enhance public safety or protect American workers, it doesn’t belong in there. Period.” The proposal comes as the Trump administration is putting temporary holds on other types of visas for lower-income immigrants — including agricultural workers, camp counselors and resort workers — as U.S. unemployment is expected to soar. The administration is also considering reversing its recent decision to increase by 35,000 the number of nonagricultural seasonal workers the U.S. brings in each year, such as landscapers, crab-pickers and lifeguards, two people familiar with the situation say.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump made cracking down on immigration the centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and a top priority of his presidency. “Our country is full,” Trump warned in April, standing at the southern border in California. He has implemented harsh travel restrictions on numerous majority-Muslim nations and cut refugee caps, but he has also backed proposals that would increase the number of immigrants and offer citizenship to some here illegally. The EB-5 program was created in 1990 to boost rural areas and economically distressed urban ones. But in recent years developers have found ways to carve high-income areas into the locations. The program has been used for years by property developers in New York City, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, to oversee projects that have helped create jobs and generate tax revenue, according to a person close to the White House. The Trump administration enacted a new rule in November raising the minimum investment amount and pushing the program to be used in rural and high-unemployment areas. Investments are supposed to lead to the creation of 10 U.S. jobs but that requirement has been interpreted in different ways. The proposed changes are likely to meet resistance from governors in states with large rural populations who believe the program — as it is currently structured — ignores them, according to a second person close to the White House. The proposal indicates immigrants would have to be “cleared first,” but it’s unclear whether that refers to the coronavirus or the immigrants’ investments. It could also address lengthy wait times that have led to a reduction in participation.  Groups that favor immigration restrictions including FAIR and Numbers USA are lobbying senators to keep changes to the program out of their bill and asking supporters across the country to call their senators. “It's ridiculous to think that there are some in Congress who are looking to take advantage of a national health crisis by pushing for a massive increase in the number of green cards made available for foreign investors,” said Chris Chmielenski, deputy director at NumbersUSA, which supports immigration restrictions. “While millions of American workers are concerned about their health and job status, Congress should be focusing on helping them and not selling off green cards.” The expansion is being pushed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a Trump ally who has supported easing restrictions in the past, according to one of the people. His office did not respond to a request for comment. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has long considered the program corrupt and tried to change the system but in 2018 called for it to shut down altogether. “The American people understand that our citizenship is a blessing, and shouldn’t be given away cheaply,” he said on the Senate floor that year. “Unfortunately, for too many years this body has witnessed the perversion and degradation of a program that sells, yes sells, our citizenship.”",Trump considers increasing visas for foreign investors ,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-considers-visas-foreign-investors-135985,politico
"AUSTIN, Texas — Texas is a big state with a proud small-government philosophy. And that’s being tested by the Covid-19 pandemic. Strict bans on public gatherings to curtail the virus' reach and widespread testing and treatment run counter to the politics of top Texas officials. Instead they're calling on local officials to lead the response. As governors in states including New York and California have imposed statewide measures such as closing schools and limiting commerce, Texas leaders have been reluctant to set restrictions conservative voters might consider draconian and business leaders oppose. They’ve also opposed steps to expand health insurance coverage.  Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration Friday — after dozens of states already had done so — and activated the National Guard on Tuesday, after more than a dozen states already had. State officials have yet to impose statewide limits on public gatherings, close schools or beaches or issue a special open enrollment period for health insurance, as California, New York and other big states have. And some health providers say Texas has been slow to boost coronavirus testing capacity and help them meet equipment needs. “In this instance, President Trump is right: Governors need to step up,” Clay Jenkins, a Democrat and Dallas County’s top elected official, said in an interview. “When it comes to stemming the tide of the loss of life that we’re staring at, the governor is in a unique position to act.”  Abbott is fully in charge of the state’s response, because as part of the small-government philosophy, the state’s Legislature meets only in odd years for 140 days. So far, more than 60 coronavirus cases and one death have been confirmed in the state. Abbott said he expects the number of cases to explode next week as more testing capacity comes online and more diagnoses are counted. Abbott, who has been governor for five years, tends to shine in moments of crisis. He’s been relatively hands-off during legislative sessions, but has played an active role in managing during disaster. Abbott earned praise for providing a steady hand during Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017. But the swift-spreading coronavirus public health crisis is catching Texas unprepared. The state, which didn’t expand Medicaid, has the highest uninsured rate in the country meaning millions of people don’t have doctors to call if they show symptoms. And Abbott has opposed local paid sick leave ordinances, which could encourage sick people to stay home and keep from spreading the virus, saying they hamper business growth. “I am pleased that Governor Abbott is engaged in a way that is certainly more substantive than President Trump — but that is such a low bar,” Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett wrote in an emailed statement. “Like Trump, he has shifted responsibility for the toughest decisions to local leaders and declined to provide leadership on limitations and closures. He has provided no leadership on health care access in the state with the most uninsured.” Health providers say the state has been slow to ramp up testing, relying instead on local officials and private companies to step up efforts. About 1,200 people have been tested so far — a fifth of the number that have been tested in California and half the number that have been tested in Minnesota, according to a POLITICO analysis of state tallies. Christopher Crow, president of Dallas-based Catalyst Health Network, said his group of clinics, which serves 1.2 million patients in the state, is ready to roll out Covid-19 testing but lacked protective gear to keep doctors and nurses from becoming infected. On Tuesday evening the group finally got equipment from the national stockpile — enough to last for two or three days of testing.  “We haven’t had to do a 180-degree turn in a moment. That is really hard,” Crow said. “I wish we had more coming from our public officials than we have right now.” Texas isn’t the only state to drag its feet on a response. But the state’s population of 30 million people and its high uninsured rate makes the state a potential hotbed for virus spread. “At some point the needs will overwhelm the health care system” in Texas, said James Hodge, Jr., director for Arizona State University’s center for public health law and policy.  Abbott’s office says the governor believes in taking a decentralized approach letting local officials take the lead in imposing restrictions and relying on private companies to help boost testing capacity. Several Texas cities and counties have already closed schools and limited public gatherings. That includes Austin, which issued an order Tuesday banning gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down restaurants and bars through early May. “County judges and mayors have done a very good job in listening to local health officials,” Abbott’s spokesman John Wittman said in an interview. “What is best in Dallas may not be best for Amarillo or Abilene.” Some local officials say Abbott is responding to conservative Texas voters who will chafe at what they see as overly restrictive measures. “The biggest challenge there is still a lot of people in our communities who are trying to figure out if we are overreacting or underreacting,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park southeast of Houston. The outbreak is coming at the same time as a downturn in oil and gas revenue, a lifeblood for the $110 billion annual Texas budget. While the state has a rainy day fund totaling more than $11 billion, some state lawmakers worry that needs for social services will skyrocket at a moment when state coffers will be emptier. The next session will be “frightening,” said Democratic state Sen. Nathan Johnson. “We are looking at a higher demand for state services and will be less financially able to deliver them.” Johnson added that he hopes the outbreak will spark a conversation about expanding health coverage and paid sick leave policies in the state.  “If we have a stronger, better thought out system of services, I think we can avoid some of the pain the next time around,” he said.

"The coronavirus may do more to unravel U.S.-Chinese ties than trade wars, technology threats and presidential tweets ever did.  The two countries’ relationship — already under enormous pressure in recent years — is on the verge of imploding as both sides seek to assign blame for the virus’ origin and exchange tit-for-tat recriminations on other fronts, including expelling journalists.  The fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability given the importance of both countries to international trade.  Beyond trade, the virus’ spread could even lead to more long-term shifts in how the U.S. and China are perceived. China, which has continued to shore up its military power in the face of longstanding U.S. supremacy, has now begun offering aid to other countries crippled by the virus as a way to showcase its global leadership amid a slow, limited U.S. reaction.  “I cannot think of a more dangerous time in the U.S.-China relationship in the last 40 years, and the carnage from the coronavirus has barely begun in the U.S.,” China analyst Bill Bishop wrote this week in his widely read Sinocism newsletter.  The first phase of the trade deal that the two sides agreed to in December eases, but does not fully eliminate, the tariffs President Donald Trump put into place and has China agreeing to buy some $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years.  China appears to be meeting some of the deal’s deadlines for now, but there are concerns that, given the damage the virus — as well as the trade war — has done to its economy, it may not be able to buy all the U.S. goods as quickly as it had promised. The virus’ effect on U.S. businesses, meanwhile, could dampen some industries’ ability to offer the goods and services China might want. Despite pressure from U.S. businesses, Trump said Wednesday he wouldn’t be suspending tariffs that remain, although the administration has exempted certain medical supplies from the import penalties.  When asked whether he would lift more the penalties, Trump said, “China is paying billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that,” reiterating his incorrect assertion that China, not U.S. businesses and consumers, pays the tariffs. “They haven't even spoken to me. China hasn’t asked me to do that.”  The response and rhetoric surrounding the pandemic is now throwing into question whether the two sides will enter into a second phase of negotiations to address some of the more systemic issues that have plagued the U.S.-China trade relationship.  The virus may prove to be the most compelling reason for the two countries to “decouple” economically, as some of Trump’s hawkish advisers have long wanted. Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that will place new “Buy America” requirements on government purchases of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has been leading the effort, which would attempt to reduce reliance on China for vital drug ingredients and supplies like masks and gloves.  “The problem we’re facing is that any time we have a public health emergency, people wake up to the extreme foreign dependency that we have,” he said. “And after the crisis is over, they promptly go back to sleep.” Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist in Trump’s White House who has long warned about the dangers posed by a rising China, said any goodwill built up as a result of reaching the initial trade deal is now moot. He blamed Beijing’s early actions — when it was accused of trying to cover up the crisis and resisting outside help — for “metastasizing” the pandemic.  “Now you can see they are on a propaganda offensive to blame this on the West, particularly the United States, and it’s going to lead to a further confrontation. There is a confrontation coming,” Bannon said.  He said a confrontation would likely involve an escalation “in the information war and the economic war.” Since the virus began to spread globally, officials on both sides have used social media and other platforms to attack each other.  Trump, for instance, has taken to calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus,” a term critics say is racist and xenophobic. He says Beijing’s ruling Communist Party has left him no choice but to do this because Chinese officials are floating conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 illness began in the U.S. or was planted in China by the U.S. military.  “I have to call it where it came from; it did come from China,” Trump said Tuesday when asked about his use of the “Chinese virus” label. “So I think it’s a very accurate term.” He continued: “I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.” Trump on Wednesday pushed back on mounting criticism for his use of the term, insisting, “It’s not racist at all.” Scientists believe the virus was first spotted in China’s Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan was an epicenter. But as China has, through strict quarantines and other measures, appeared to bring the virus under control, it has gone about trying to fudge that history.  A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Lijian Zhao, has been particularly brash, using Twitter — a platform banned for most Chinese — to share articles and raise questions about whether the U.S. was the origin of the illness.  “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao tweeted on March 12.  The Washington-Beijing clash is going well beyond just rhetoric.  China said this week that it is expelling American journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. It also announced new restrictions on several U.S.-based outlets including Voice of America.  American reporters have been among the most aggressive in covering the coronavirus outbreak in China, as well as other issues deemed sensitive there.  China said it was merely taking reciprocal action after the Trump administration recently announced new restrictions on Chinese media outlets in America, including capping the number of Chinese citizens working for them. The Trump administration also has designated several Chinese media outlets as foreign missions — effectively treating them as arms of the Chinese government, which plenty of analysts say is a fair characterization.  In a briefing with reporters Wednesday, a senior State Department official defended the Trump administration’s approach in high altitude terms, saying that for decades the U.S. has tried to build a “normal relationship” with China, but that the Chinese have taken advantage of America’s relatively open system without offering similar access.  “For the last 40 years, you can characterize a relationship of them competing while we’ve been trying to cooperate. This administration has understood that this is a relationship characterized by strategic competition,” the official said. Many public health experts have raised alarms about the U.S.-China rhetoric and reciprocal actions during the coronavirus crisis.  They argue that now is not the time for either side to insult the other, because working together will help speed up efforts to contain the virus across the world.  And the U.S., to its credit, has sent tons of humanitarian aid to China and offered millions in additional assistance to help it fight the virus. Trump himself has avoided criticizing Chinese leader Xi Jinping directly. It’s a cautious approach he’s long taken despite the trade war and other scuffles, apparently believing that keeping a strong personal relationship with Xi could pay off down the line. In January, when Trump was downplaying the spread of the illness, he even thanked Xi in a tweet praising China for “working very hard” to contain the coronavirus. But Trump aides feel they cannot allow the Chinese to rewrite history. In a phone call with a senior Chinese foreign policy official earlier this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned “that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,” according to a State Department readout.  While some Democrats have blasted the Trump administration and its supporters for its heated rhetoric toward China, there’s strong bipartisan support in Washington for the broader idea that the U.S. needs to be tougher on China. And there are plenty of signs that sentiment isn’t on pause amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers have sent legislation to Trump that allows for paying rural telecom carriers $1 billion to eliminate and replace materials in their networks that come from Huawei and ZTE. Both are Chinese telecommunications firms that U.S. officials fear could be a means of exposing U.S. networks to Chinese hacking and spying.  In mid-February, the U.S. Department of Justice filed racketeering and conspiracy charges against Huawei and some of its subsidiaries, alleging they were trying to steal trade secrets from American companies.  The Chinese Communist Party, which saw its reputation dealt a major blow over its initial handling of the virus within its borders, is now trying to capitalize on its recent successes containing the illness’ spread.  China has sent experts to assist Italy as it battles severe outbreaks of the virus, while offering assistance to Spain. It has pledged to send at least 100,000 test kits to the Philippines. And it has made clear, through actions and pledges, that it will help other nations that need it.  Chinese charities have also stepped up to offer assistance to other countries, including the United States. In requesting Beijing’s assistance, Serbia’s president declared this week: “The only country that can help us is China.”  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Wednesday that the Chinese government would be donating 2 million surgical masks, 200,000 N95 masks and 50,000 testing kits to the European Union.  “This support is highly valued and we are grateful for it,” she said.  It’s clear that Beijing sees itself filling a global leadership role that would traditionally be held by the United States, but which, under Trump’s “America First” philosophy, appears vacant.  Chinese state-controlled media websites are filled with stories about the U.S. struggle to control the virus in its borders. They’re also filled with stories about Chinese leader Xi offering words of comfort to his counterparts abroad.  “Sunshine always comes after the rain,” Xi said, according to a Chinese media report of his conversation with Spain’s prime minister.

"General Motors is studying whether to retool its shuttered production lines to make ventilators and other needed medical equipment to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, company officials said Wednesday. GM CEO Mary Barra was in contact with administration officials on Wednesday updating them on a decision to suspend production for the rest of the month. “She also indicated GM is working to help find solutions for the nation during this difficult time and has offered to help, and we are already studying how we can potentially support production of medical equipment like ventilators,” a GM spokesperson told POLITICO. The U.S. faces a shortage of life-saving ventilators if patients infected with Covid-19, a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, overwhelm U.S. hospitals. President Donald Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act, which will allow him to direct domestic manufacturers to produce medical supplies and other necessary items during the crisis. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday that he was in touch with leaders of two of the three major U.S. automakers. Ford and Fiat Chrysler also said they would suspend production of automobiles until at least March 30. “One of them told me that even though the men and women may be off for two weeks due to the virus, she’s going to try to call them back so they can produce ventilators,” Kudlow said on Fox News, in an apparent reference to Barra, the only female CEO of a major U.S. auto company. “They might even ask them to do it on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons,” he said. The auto industry in Canada has also expressed a willingness to produce necessary medical supplies for demand in that country. “We’ve got the capacity to make things from simple one-shot molds to complex assemblies. We make 500,000 of something every year, a thousand a day,” said Flavio Volpe, president of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. “The country needs masks, gowns, goggles, ventilators. Can we assign some of our capacity to be able to help the cause,” he said in an interview with CBC. “The response has been overwhelming from auto parts makers. We’re in, just get us the specs.”",Auto industry could shift to make ventilators,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/auto-industry-could-shift-to-make-ventilators-136256,politico
"Can the state tell your favorite local restaurant to close, or tell you that you must stay at home unless it’s absolutely necessary to leave, because of an emergency? The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have closed down bars, movie theaters and dine-in restaurants. Six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area have imposed a shelter-in-place order that allows people to leave their homes only for essential activities. In response to these drastic measures intended to slow down the spread of coronavirus, there are plenty of voices on social media, and even some in government, denouncing such measures as unprecedented, un-American and unconstitutional. Most of us have never imagined such impositions outside of a situation of armed conflict, but allegations that those measures in the current circumstances are unlawful are wrong. And this is a case where legal misinformation can exacerbate a public health crisis. States—and their cities and counties by extension—possess what has long been known as a “police power” to govern for the health, welfare and safety of their citizens. This broad authority, which can be traced to English common law and is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment, is far from radical; it justifies why states can regulate at all. The police power of the states has been invoked on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court, often in contrast to the limited powers of the federal government—for example, in Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in the 2012 Obamacare case. This power also has been recognized in the context of public health for decades. In a 1905 Supreme Court case that upheld mandatory smallpox vaccinations, the court observed that “upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” What does this mean for the drastic coronavirus responses we’re seeing across the country? State and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary. (Thankfully, with COVID-19, we have so far seen mostly peaceful, even if begrudging, compliance to “flatten the curve” so that our health care workers and hospitals are not overwhelmed.) But, you might ask, don’t I have individual rights, even in a pandemic? Of course you do. We possess constitutionally protected rights to assemble and travel, for instance. State and local governments must be careful to make sure that measures they impose to protect people are not overly broad and are taken only for justifiably important reasons. Our legal history is filled with cases where government has had insufficiently important reasons to justify restrictive measures, or where the measures themselves are overly broad. Or even cases where government restrictions turn out to have been implemented for impermissibly discriminatory reasons, such as when the city of San Francisco targeted only its Chinese residents in a bubonic plague outbreak in 1900. Not all exercises of the police power will withstand constitutional scrutiny. But the very existence of this framework—the balance between the need to protect the public and individual rights—assumes that there will be times when there are truly compelling emergencies justifying severe measures. A global pandemic that spreads even among those who are asymptomatic and could exceed the capacity of the American health care system would appear to be just such a compelling situation. When prominent voices tell the public that these drastic measures are somehow inherently unlawful or obviously unconstitutional, they detract from the social solidarity we need right now. People who are misled about what the government may do, and confused about its established powers, might not take heed of the necessary measures to protect their own health and that of their communities. At some point in the future, we could see a coronavirus response that has gone on too long or is too broad to justify its burdens. Or we might see instances of people who were denied civil liberties without real justification. Even now, you might feel that these measures are too little, too late, or that they are drastic, and burdensome. But if we are facing a window of opportunity that is rapidly closing, to say that the states cannot try to use their most basic authority to save lives is not only wrong—it might be deadly.","Yes, States and Local Governments Can Close Private Businesses and Restrict Your Movement",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/states-police-power-coronavirus-135826,politico
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that his company is stepping up its efforts to combat misinformation about the coronavirus — but has not received requests from governments worldwide to turn over its users' data. Speaking to reporters by phone, Zuckerberg said discussions in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere have focused on ways that Facebook could combat misinformation connected to Covid-19, and not on how governments could use people’s digital information to combat the virus. “I don’t think it would make sense to share people’s data if people haven’t opted in for that,” he said. “At a high level, the answer is probably no,” Zuckerberg added in response to questions about whether he would be open to such data sharing with government agencies. Facebook already partners with public health organizations to monitor global diseases based on data from users who have opted to share their location information, he said. European governments, privacy regulators, telecom operators and digital companies have been considering reducing global data protection standards in recent days so officials can access large amounts of social media data to model how the coronavirus is spreading. U.S. authorities have also had discussions with companies like Facebook and Google about how their data could aid in the virus response, according to some news reports, although White House officials have told POLITICO they have not requested data on the companies' users. The big online companies possess a wealth of information on their billions of users, include their travels, friendships, interests and even diet and exercise habits. But while some of that data could be useful for public health efforts like the virus response, the companies are also wary of retriggering the same alarms about privacy violations that have triggered outcries and investigations in both the U.S. and Europe. In recent weeks, false reports have spread on Facebook's messaging platform WhatsApp as people seek information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp has limited the ability of people to forward digital messages, a move that has helped reduce the spread of falsehoods. He said governments have not ramped up pressure to reduce its encryption levels to combat coronavirus misinformation, but added that his company would not change its policy on so-called end-to-end encryption. Countries like the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom have consistently called for the company to alter its stance on encryption, in part to tackle online terrorist content. “We really believe there are other ways to get at preventing harm that are more effective than getting rid of encryption,” Zuckerberg said. Facebook has also come under pressure to clamp down on the spread of false reports across its main platform and Instagram as well, and Zuckerberg announced several new initiatives that would be rolled out in the coming days. Facebook’s latest response efforts include a “coronavirus information center” that will be added to the top of users’ news feeds with links to reputable information about the illness and the websites of government health agencies. That would start to show up on people’s social media pages in the U.S. and Europe in the next 24 hours, and will be updated as public health officials release new information, Zuckerberg said. The company is also making its enterprise software, called Workplace, available to governments and emergency organizations free for the next year to help them more easily communicate while working remotely. Zuckerberg, who like many people in the U.S. is now working from home, empathized with the fact that such arrangements are proving difficult for his workers and others across the country. “It’s a huge change to work from home, especially with the schools all closed and there are kids around,” he told reporters. “It’s a difficult and stressful time for people.” Among those working from home now are scores of content moderators who are tasked with identifying and removing the platform's most harmful or obscene content. Zuckerberg acknowledged that some content moderation tasks can’t be carried out from home, meaning Facebook will rely more heavily on artificial intelligence systems with varying degrees of accuracy. The company will also shift more moderators to look for content that indicates a user may be considering suicide or self-harm as increased isolation during the coronavirus outbreak could have an impact on mental health, he said. The challenge comes as Facebook is also experiencing peak usage, eclipsing high-traffic moments like midnight on New Year’s Eve, the result of more people being physically isolated from friends and family. ""We really need to make sure we're on top of this from an infrastructure perspective, to make sure that things don't melt down, and can continue to provide the level of service that people need in a time like this,” Zuckerberg said.",Zuckerberg: Governments have not asked for user data for coronavirus fight,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/mark-zuckerberg-coronavirus-user-data-136028,politico
"The FDA is so desperate for information about shortages in coronavirus testing supplies that it is turning to an unlikely source of information: Twitter. Wading into the Wild West of social media for help during a global pandemic may seem unsophisticated for an agency charged with regulating the nation’s drugs and medical devices. But thanks to a decades-old law, the FDA cannot require device manufacturers to report shortages in the same way it can for drugmakers. This fundamental gap in the flow of information has made it difficult for the FDA to identify weaknesses in the supply chain for coronavirus testing and in the nationwide push to test hundreds of thousands of patients. The agency is responsible for regulating coronavirus tests used by U.S. laboratories. So the FDA is making plaintive appeals on Twitter, in addition to negotiating with companies behind the scenes. “@US_FDA suggests companies make public their inventory, production schedule and a hotline number to address questions regarding availability of reagents and other supplies needed for #COVID19 testing,” Anand Shah, the agency’s deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs, tweeted on March 17. “If you have an allocation plan to maximize efficient testing, please post.” The FDA is seeking information about swabs, test kits, instruments and supplies for transporting and preparing samples for analysis, Shah said in a subsequent tweet that tagged the @FDADeviceInfo account. A spokesperson for the medical device trade lobby AdvaMed told POLITICO that it is working with the FDA “to find the best way to ensure the appropriate information gets to the FDA during this time of crisis.” The Trump administration has sought to tighten rules for device makers in recent years, bringing them in line with the regulations that require drug manufacturers to warn the government when a shortage seems likely — and how long it could last. The president’s 2020 budget request proposed requiring device-makers to tell the FDA if a significant interruption of essential products was likely, and to file regular reports on their manufacturing capacity. Similar plans have been gaining steam in Congress. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill in February to bolster FDA’s authority to monitor device shortages, and Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) unveiled similar legislation in March. But with those proposals in legislative limbo, the agency may have to get creative to track potential shortages at a time when countries around the world are competing for the same basic testing supplies. Michael Heyl, a medical device attorney at Hogan Lovells, says that the FDA can glean clues from lists of approved device suppliers to get a window into where companies source materials. “Those are all available to FDA for review upon inspection,” Heyl said. “An argument can be made that at least who the suppliers are is something that FDA has the ability to see.” Others argue that a global crisis is not the time to change the rules for device manufacturers. “There's a balance that has to be struck between giving that information to FDA and creating additional reporting requirements in a time where people can't quite keep up with all that they're required to do already in terms of getting these tests up and running,” said Scott Danzis, an attorney at Covington & Burling who specializes in medical diagnostics. In the meantime, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told reporters this week that the agency is monitoring the stock of testing supplies and personal protective equipment “very closely.” “There is pressure on the supply chain with respect to the reagents, swabs, or transport media that are needed to perform these tests,” Hahn said. “We have been leaning in with manufacturers — both of the tests, but also of these other supplies that are needed.”",FDA turns to Twitter to help track testing supply shortages,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/fda-twitter-coronavirus-testing-136014,politico
"Bill Weld ended his quixotic primary campaign against President Donald Trump on Wednesday after winning only a single delegate in the 2020 contest.  ""While I am suspending my candidacy, I want to be clear that I am not suspending my commitment to the nation and to the democratic institutions that set us apart,"" Weld wrote in an email to supporters.  Weld, the former two-term Massachusetts governor, pitched himself as an anti-Trump, pro-choice former prosecutor who supported cutting taxes and combating climate change. He backed Trump's impeachment, and was among a handful of Republicans who ran for the nomination and dropped out over the course of the election cycle.  Weld won a single delegate in Iowa, but had trouble competing with Trump's popularity among the GOP base. Weld was also hampered by Republican rules that use a winner-take-all formula to award delegates, including in his native Massachusetts. Weld's exit from the race means Trump is now the party's presumptive nominee — though it was never really in doubt. Trump amassed the number of delegates needed to win the party's nomination on Tuesday night after polls closed in Illinois, Arizona and Florida.  ""Nobody motivates our base more than President Trump, as evidenced by the historic turnout we've seen in state after state this primary season,"" said RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""[We] are thrilled to have President Trump as our party’s presumptive nominee once again."" Weld ran for vice president as a Libertarian in 2016, alongside former presidential candidate Gary Johnson. In the days leading up to the general election in 2016, Weld encouraged voters to choose Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump. The former Massachusetts governor re-registered as a Republican in 2019 to run for president.  Announcing the end of his campaign, Weld thanked his ""tens of thousands of supporters and donors.""  ""I am intensely grateful to all the patriotic women and men who have stood with me and supported me during the past eleven months in our effort to bring better government to Washington, D.C.,"" Weld said.",Weld ends long-shot bid for GOP nomination,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/bill-weld-ends-2020-campaign-135951,politico

"Ford and General Motors are halting production at all North American plants through March 30, the companies confirmed today. GM said production status would be reevaluated week-to-week after March 30.  Ford temporarily closed the Michigan Assembly Plant final assembly building earlier today after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus. The company is instructing those who had direct contact with the employee to self-quarantine and seek medical attention. All other plants will close after Thursday evening‘s shifts. In a statement, Ford said manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico will be closed so they can be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized and to protect workers from the spread of the novel coronavirus. GM said its plants will be closing “in a cadence, with each facility receiving specific instructions from manufacturing leadership.“ Leaders from the companies and the United Auto Workers will work together on plans to restart production in compliance with social distancing protocols among workers, including at shift change times, and to maximize cleaning times between shifts changes. UAW President Rory Gamble called the temporary shutdown “prudent,” giving leaders time to “review best practices“ to prevent the spread of the virus. Ford, UAW, GM and Fiat Chrysler announced Sunday they were forming a Coronavirus Task Force “to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies.“ The Associated Press has reported that FCA is also shuttering plants in Michigan but FCA did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. Ford is also closing manufacturing sites in Germany and Romania. A Ford plant in Spain already halted production Monday after three workers were diagnosed with the coronavirus over the weekend.","Ford, GM to halt North American production ",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/coronavirus-ford-gm-halting-production-135917,politico
"The White House has issued a “temporary pause” on congressional testimony for senior officials involved in the coronavirus response, according to correspondence obtained by POLITICO — a move that has some House Democrats complaining about stonewalling even as they acknowledge the need to give health officials space to manage the crisis. The halt in high-level officials appearing at hearings is slated to last through the end of the month and is intended, according to the March 16 letter, to ensure that the Trump administration is “directly focused on executing its day-to-day response to COVID-19.” “Due to the full Administration mobilization underway, we are instituting a temporary pause with respect to the involvement in hearings of government witnesses who are engaged in the coronavirus response,” Cassidy Hutchinson, a White House legislative affairs official, wrote to top House committee aides. “Right now, the Executive Branch needs all of its resources directly focused on executing its day-to-day response to COVID-19.” “This pause is effective immediately. It is intended to last for three weeks, through the end of March,” Hutchinson added, emphasizing that the administration would “continue to offer full transparency to Congress and the American people.” The letter has prompted grousing among congressional Democrats, who say that while they understand the urgency facing the administration, the move closely followed explosive testimony to the Oversight Committee from top Trump health officials that shed a negative light on the administration’s handling of the crisis. In particular, lawmakers note, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci told lawmakers last week that there had been a “failing” by the government to implement testing early in the spread of the illness. “It’s no coincidence that the White House ordered key officials to stop testifying before Congress right after Dr. Fauci warned the Oversight Committee that the Trump Administration’s testing program is failing,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), a member of the oversight panel. Democrats also say Fauci’s testimony directly played a role in convincing the NBA to suspend its season, an example of the profound impact sworn testimony from senior health officials can have on decision-makers going forward. The Oversight committee’s chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, (D-N.Y.) said she hoped to be able to “work with the Administration in a reasonable way to make sure Dr. Fauci and other key officials are allowed to continue providing information to Congress in this critical period, even as we recognize the key functions they are serving.” “Congress plays a critical role to ensure all federal resources are used effectively and efficiently in this time of crisis, especially when state and local entities are saying they do not have what they need to fight this pandemic,” Maloney added. A senior administration official emphasized that the pause in public testimony would be brief and would not preclude other forms of information-sharing with Congress. “Agencies that are involved in the coronavirus response are working with Congressional committees to postpone hearings temporarily while they fully focus their resources on the mission,” said a senior administration official. “The Administration will continue to practice ‘radical transparency’ with Congress and the American people during this public health emergency.” The White House has been holding near-daily press briefings to provide updates on the coronavirus response. And Fauci is far from silenced; he’s been a ubiquitous presence on television, appearing on multiple Sunday news shows and giving interviews. In addition, lawmakers themselves don’t appear to be clamoring to hold any public hearings in the near-term. The House is in a long-planned weeklong recess while leaders work with the Senate on a massive economic stimulus package, and House officials have recommended that members and staff practice social distancing for the foreseeable future, limiting the prospect of gathering for high-profile public hearings. However, House Democrats say direct communication between lawmakers and senior officials remains crucial during the crisis. The frustration voiced by some Democrats captures a lingering tension between the Trump administration and the House, which has been seeking additional documents and information about the administration’s pandemic preparation. For example, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), whose state had one of the earliest cases of the virus, has been requesting information from CDC on testing capacity, and says the response he's received has been ""incomplete and still fails to give us a complete picture of the country’s ability to process coronavirus tests.""  House Democratic aides say they’ve also struggled to get detailed information on decision-making surrounding the availability of coronavirus tests; whether the administration heeded warnings from public health experts in January; and other important questions about the early days of the crisis. But they also acknowledge that senior officials should be focused on handling the immediate challenges the nation is facing, especially while experts urge Americans to stay home when possible. “We’ve also been trying to give them distance to respond to the outbreak,” said one House Democratic aide. “So, we’re going to have a long list of questions after this is over.” “Hopefully this won’t look like pointing fingers,” said another Democratic aide, who agreed that the House plans to ramp up oversight after the immediate crisis subsides. “America is in the emergency room right now. We’re trying to stabilize the patient first.”",White House pauses testimony for officials handling coronavirus response,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/white-house-coronavirus-officials-testimony-135806,politico
"Last week, to protect the Supreme Court from coronavirus, Chief Justice John Roberts banned visitors and then this week postponed hearing oral arguments altogether. But the virus isn’t the only thing endangering the court, and the chief justice should also take steps to protect the institution. Last month, President Donald Trump questioned the impartiality of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, suggesting they recuse themselves from cases involving him. Earlier this month, while addressing a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building, Sen. Chuck Schumer seemingly threatened Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, saying the two would “pay the price” for their conservative decisions. Roberts issued a swift public statement admonishing Schumer for politicizing the court, and Schumer responded by accusing Roberts of deliberately misinterpreting his comments while staying silent about Trump’s similar rhetoric. In fact, Roberts has been fighting against the perceived political leanings of judges for some time. In 2018, in response to Trump’s claim that “Obama judges” rule against his administration’s policies, Roberts rebutted that there are no “Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.”  But if Roberts is serious about protecting his fellow jurists from future political attacks, then he must do more than issue stern statements of disapproval. Instead, he should reconsider the way the court conveys its decisions to the public. Specifically, he should make per curiam opinions—anonymous opinions, issued without disclosing the identity of the authoring judge or the voting blocs’ membership—the new standard. Per curiam opinions circumvent the political cues associated with a given justice’s identity and instead allow the court to present its holdings as an institution. Not only would this shield the justices from being targeted as individuals, but research also shows that it would strengthen public support for the court’s decisions. From the Supreme Court’s perspective, political attacks against its members are worrisome, no matter who levies them. Without a mechanism to enforce its holdings, the Supreme Court must rely on the other political branches to respect its decisions. Critiques that frame the court’s behavior as political can erode its perception as a legitimate institution. And without widely accepted public deference, the court is powerless. The court has issued per curiam opinions throughout its history, although its use of these opinions has been far from methodical, ranging from landmark cases to the mundane with no rhyme or reason up to now as to why. Systematically removing the identity of the opinions’ authors would convey several benefits. First, peer-reviewed research, conducted by myself and several coauthors, has shown that the use of per curiam opinions strengthens the level of support decisions receive. In a series of survey experiments, we held constant a court opinion’s content—that is, the actual legal holding of the case—but we randomized the identity of the authoring justice. In one study, we investigated whether support for a given case was conditioned on the ideology of the authoring justice. In another, we sought to gauge whether the use of per curiam opinions garnered more support compared to cases with an identified author. In both instances, we found that individuals adjust their level of agreement based on their perception of the opinion author rather than the case disposition itself, and per curiam opinions garnered the greatest level of support of all. Second, from a practical standpoint, there would be no way for a political actor to target an individual justice for a disagreeable per curiam opinion. Being unable to target a single justice leaves only the Supreme Court—as an institution—as a possible target. And the risk that such general attacks will spark an institutional crisis for the court is low, because the public has long held the court as a whole in high regard, at least compared with Congress and the Executive, irrespective of the opinions they may hold toward individual justices. The court currently enjoys its highest level of approval since 2009—despite being entangled in pronounced Senate gamesmanship since Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing in 2016. Even among those who view the court as more of a political institution than a legal one, research indicates that individuals are reluctant to support drastic political reprisals against the court and its justices, such as efforts to “pack” the court or to impeach justices. And even those more extensive reforms would only exacerbate the particularized attacks by politicians against individual justices, which Roberts has described as “inappropriate” and “dangerous.”  Instituting the norm of per curiam opinions would be easy because the Supreme Court already issues such holdings, albeit infrequently. Since 2013, from six to 14 cases per term have been per curiam majority opinions, and so far this term these opinions account for three of the court’s 14 holdings. Per curiam opinions are distributed fairly evenly across issue areas, and the voting blocs within these types of cases vary from 5-4 splits to unanimous decisions and everything in between. Whether or not a case will be decided per curiam is within the chief justice’s control. And to be sure, these sorts of opinions up to now have not been reserved for inconsequential or unimportant cases. Bush v. Gore is but one example of a per curiam majority opinion used in a prominent, highly political case. Chief Justice John Marshall, during the court’s infancy, established the norm of announcing a decision via a single Opinion of the Court, penned by a justice in the majority—rather than a series of opinions written by each member of the bench. (Thomas Jefferson supported the prior setup of “seriatim” opinions, which still, on rare occasion, are used today.) In the same way, Roberts can establish a new norm of per curiam opinions.  Some critics have spoken out in the past against the use of per curiam opinions, claiming this form of legal decision skirts the notion of judicial accountability. But this critique glosses over a cornerstone principle of our constitutional framework: judicial independence. The reason the Constitution grants Supreme Court justices life tenure—rather than connecting them to the populace through regular elections—is to ensure that they are able to make decisions free from outside influences, especially political pressure. Our system of government allows for the judiciary to be checked by constitutional amendments, not individualized, political finger-pointing. What’s more, the use of per curiam opinions does not forgo internal accountability from within the court. Dissenting opinions may still be used by the minority bloc as an effective method for calling the public’s attention to any flaws or shortcomings in the per curiam majority opinion’s reasoning, consequently laying the groundwork for future legal challenges. The politicization of the Supreme Court by outside actors, and the popular discourse it creates, stands in stark contrast with the court’s reality. Since Roberts was confirmed as chief justice in 2005, 79 percent of cases have been decided by something other than a 5-4 split, and unanimous decisions have been the most common.  Of course, justices may be averse to changing the deep-rooted tradition of issuing signed opinions. And there’s no doubt, as Ginsburg herself notes, that disclosing “votes and opinion writers may nourish a judge’s ego,” so directing justices to cede the renown that can accompany authoring revered decisions may be a tall order. But there’s also little reason to suspect political attacks against the Supreme Court will stop any time soon without intervention. Protracted politicization puts the court on tenuous footing, and the chief justice can do more to act on his presumably sincere desire to insulate the court’s members from further political targeting. The exclusive use of per curiam opinions would erect a formidable defense against such future attacks while cementing the chief justice’s legacy as a vigilant protector of “the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court” that he so long ago promised to be.",The One Change John Roberts Can Make to Depoliticize the Supreme Court,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/john-roberts-political-supreme-court-opinions-135769,politico
"Senate Democrats and unions appear to be hardening their desire to attach strings to airline aid for coronavirus relief, and Wednesday slammed the White House’s $50 billion proposal for airlines, calling for stricter limits on executive bonuses, stock buybacks and even carbon emissions. The White House package would allow $50 billion in secured loans for the airline industry with limits on increases in executive compensation until they are repaid, according to a memo by the Treasury Department. But the head of one of the biggest U.S. unions for flight attendants scoffed in response. ""Is this a joke?"" tweeted Sara Nelson, the head of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA in response to the White House plan. ""No more buybacks. No more bonuses. We need to make sure money goes to workers — period."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he wouldn’t support $50 billion in loans to airlines unless more conditions are attached. Along with “really severe limits on executive compensation,” Blumenthal said there should be “conditions that protect workers.” He said pilots and flight attendants should have “better working conditions” and higher pay and that airlines must “commit to do better” in terms of charges, fees, baggage handling and seat size. Earlier Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also targeted airline stock buybacks in comments on the Senate floor. The practice has attracted criticism from progressive Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after the airline industry requested a nearly $60 billion bailout from Congress this week, including $29 billion in grants and another $29 billion in loans or loan guarantees. “One of the reasons, let’s not forget, that many airlines are so short of cash right now is they spent billions on stock buybacks — money they had to send out when they should have been saving it for a rainy day, for their workers and customers,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “That issue should be addressed.” Later, Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told POLITICO that demands could also include limits on executive pay and provisions that would see taxpayers take on stock in airlines, similar to how the government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. ""If we do anything like that, it would have to be done on a business-like basis, which would be demanding preferred shares in the company, so when they recover, taxpayers will get the benefit of the investment,"" Reed (D-R.I.) said. ""We have restrictions on share buybacks, on dividends, on executive pay, we make sure their workforce is treated fairly, that they're not the victims of this after use of our resources — similar to some of the things we did with the banks Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said she wanted to ensure that airplane mechanics aren't put out of work, saying ""the last time this happened, we wiped out the heavy repair industry and all those jobs went to Mexico and Brazil."" ""The last time we helped out the airlines we didn’t actually put any guardrails around some of this money, whether it’s task credits for repair work — so the maintenance companies actually went out of business,"" she added. ""The airlines came back but all of those maintenance jobs went overseas and we need to make sure that we keep those jobs here. So the MROs, the maintenance repair operators, they need to be protected as well."" Some Senate Republicans have cringed at the idea of “bailing out” industry, but on Wednesday, a key Republican appeared open to the idea of providing loans. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he “would have some real concerns” about a “bailout” for the airline industry, but loans are “different.” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who leads the Senate’s transportation spending panel, said she has spoken with some airlines and she has “no doubt that this is a financial crisis for them.” “And I think, given their importance to our economy, and to our eventual recovery, that we are going to have to provide some sort of assistance — whether it should be in the form of loans, secured loans, I’m not sure yet,” Collins said. Separately, a group of eight Democratic senators led by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, wrote to congressional leadership today asking them to include provisions pushing the airline sector to cut carbon emissions in any aid package. The sector produces about 2.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions today. “Given the poor records of some companies in these industries, we believe that any such financial assistance should be paired with requirements that companies act in a more responsible fashion,” read the letter, also signed by Sens. Martin Heinrich (N.M.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (Ct.), Tina Smith (Minn.) and Debbie Stabenow (Mich.).

"The stock market’s latest plunge on Wednesday did more than wipe out billions of dollars in investor equity. It also nearly obliterated President Donald Trump’s favorite measure of his economic success. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's decline below 20,000 almost completely erased all of the iconic index's previous gains since Trump's inauguration, jeopardizing a key talking point for his reelection campaign. Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 fell by more than 7 percent, triggering a marketwide trading halt. Since his 2016 victory, Trump has tweeted dozens of times about the record stock gains under his watch, posting as recently as Feb. 19 that it was the “Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!” He has repeatedly suggested that Americans check their 401(k)s to tote up their gains, and argued that the markets would have crashed had Hillary Clinton defeated him. Now the upheaval sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with plunging oil prices and fears that shares were already inflated, has panicked investors, sending the Dow below the 19,827 where it stood on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Trump was inaugurated. Stocks pared their losses late in the day, and the Dow closed at 19,904. Trump, for his part, always uses the election as the starting point, noting that the market surged the morning after the results were in. The Dow closed at 18,332, on Nov. 8, 2016, Election Day. Trump's top economic aides have also eagerly made the connection between the health of the stock market and the success of his presidency. In a CNBC interview a month after Trump’s inauguration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he “absolutely” views the stock market as a “report card” for the administration. The stock plunge underscores the risk Trump took in tying his presidential reputation to stock prices, which can go down as easily as they can go up, and in any case are only one indicator of the health of the economy. President Barack Obama, for instance, oversaw one of the longest bull runs ever in the markets, but economic growth averaged just a tepid 1.6 percent through his two terms in office. “Letting equity markets grade your performance is perilous, and this is why,” said Tony Fratto, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and a former Treasury Department official. “Markets are fickle. There are things far beyond your control.” “They can point to the coronavirus and say the market was great except for that, but it may be a long time before the market recovers,” he added. “And now they have to shift to focusing on underlying fundamentals, which is what they should have been focused on all along.” The more than 6 percent drop in the Dow today comes after weeks of whipsawing prices in markets, including three more times in the past couple of weeks where stocks dropped enough that it triggered a “circuit breaker” that caused a halt in trading for 15 minutes. Stocks could fall further as investors continue to seek more dramatic action from the administration and Congress to shore up the economy.","Dow tumbles again, nearly wiping out gains of Trump’s presidency",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/donald-trump-stock-market-dip-135807,politico
"President Donald Trump said Wednesday the Department of Housing and Urban Development will suspend foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration until the end of April, a move that will affect about 8.1 million mortgages. The Federal Housing Finance Agency also ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the companies behind about half of the nation’s $11 trillion mortgage market, to suspend foreclosures and evictions for any single-family mortgages they back for “at least 60 days,” the agency said.  Trump's move, announced at a White House press conference, is part of a broad-based response by the administration to the fallout from the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, which threatens to shut down large swaths of the economy and has wreaked havoc in many countries overseas. FHFA Director Mark Calabria said the foreclosure and eviction suspension will allow people ""to stay in their homes during this national emergency,” Fannie and Freddie ""are working with mortgage servicers to ensure that borrowers facing hardship because of the coronavirus can get assistance,” Calabria said in a statement, adding that those borrowers should get in touch with their mortgage servicers as quickly as possible. Calabria told economists on a conference call this afternoon that the agency is seeking to help both those borrowers affected by the virus and those who were struggling to make payments before the outbreak. Out of a public health concern, he said, Fannie and Freddie would make sure people who were already behind on their mortgages aren’t evicted and put on the street in the middle of a pandemic. HUD Deputy Secretary Brian Montgomery said he has not been in any discussions with the Trump administration about urging commercial lenders to suspend mortgage payments in the crisis. Italy suspended mortgage payments last week. Montgomery said the FHA has a “robust set of tools” to deal with turmoil in the housing market in a crisis, noting they’ve suspended foreclosures and evictions before at a regional level in the wake of natural disasters like hurricanes. “For the time being, it just hits the pause button and provides steadiness to the housing market,” Montgomery said in a phone interview. “This is a first step; people who were concerned about [losing their homes] can cross that off their list for now.” The FHFA earlier this month had announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would provide payment forbearance — allowing mortgage payments to be suspended for up to a year — to borrowers hit by the outbreak. The two government-owned enterprises also reminded mortgage servicers that hardship forbearance is an option for borrowers unable to make payments. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Kathy Kraninger, the chief official tasked with helping consumers struggling with the economic fallout from the outbreak, released a statement today praising the housing agencies for the suspensions. The bureau has “encouraged financial institutions to work with their customers affected by the coronavirus,” Kraninger said in an email. “Consumers’ first stop in the face of hardship is with their creditors and their financial institutions, so our message was important for regulated entities to hear,” she added.","HUD, Fannie, Freddie suspend foreclosures, evictions during outbreak",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/hud-suspends-foreclosures-evictions-coronavirus-135783,politico
"U.S. stock exchanges temporarily halted trading Wednesday, as coronavirus fears again sent stock prices plummeting in a massive selloff. Shortly before 1 p.m., the S&P 500 index hit the 7 percent decline needed to trigger a mandatory 15-minute break under Securities and Exchange Commission trading rules. It was the fourth mandatory break in two weeks as economic damage from the virus has triggered a punishing series of trading runs. As was the case on Monday, pre-market trading had already shown signs of strain in stock futures. By the time markets opened, all three major indices — the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index — had dropped 5 percent, hitting the maximum allowable selloff for futures before the start of trading. That outlook persisted despite the fact the White House spoke Monday and Tuesday of plans for spending hundreds of billions of dollars to help ease the economic damage caused by virus-related shutdowns and layoffs. And the Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced significant expansions in lending from a stabilization fund to make sure creditworthy businesses could continue to access funding. Following all those announcements, markets recovered slightly during trading Tuesday, with the S&P advancing 6 percent. But Tuesday's bounce followed a historic bloodbath in the markets on Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst single-point loss in history, declining 2,999 points or 12.9 percent. Investors were clearly expecting a rough start to the week after a weekend of government announcements to rapidly expand containment measures, including through school closures as well as shuttering bars and restaurants. The Federal Reserve also cut interest rates to zero on Sunday, but that didn't avert the selloff. There are three possible market-wide circuit breakers, which regulators put in place in 2013 to ensure that declines in stocks are orderly. If the S&P 500 index drops 7 percent or 13 percent before 3:25 p.m., trading will stop for 15 minutes. After 3:25 p.m., declines in those levels don’t halt market-wide trading. But a 20 percent market decline at any time of day halts trading for the rest of the day. There were two trading pauses last week and one on Monday. Before that, the only time a market-wide break occurred was in 1997, under different thresholds and rules established by the SEC following a stock market crash in 1987.",Stock plunge triggers fourth trading pause in 2 weeks,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/stock-plunge-triggers-trading-pause-135792,politico

"President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday he is dispatching the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort to New York Harbor, while also invoking the Defense Production Act to expand the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking beside Trump in the White House, Defense Secretary Mark Esper also announced that he has alerted field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as needed to support the response. The Navy has two hospital ships. The other, USNS Mercy, is being prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast, Trump said. The ships will be launched in the next week, he said, noting that he spoke with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced the Comfort deployment in a press conference minutes before the president's comments. ""They are in tip-top shape,"" Trump said. The Navy is getting ships crewed and ready to launch, defense officials said. Mercy should be underway in days, but Comfort could take two weeks to deploy because it is still finishing up maintenance, according to chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman. Esper told reporters Tuesday that the Pentagon is preparing the ships, which are equipped with 1,000 hospital beds each, for a potential deployment to hotspots to relieve civilian hospitals dealing with the virus. Defense officials noted that the hospital ships aren't conducive to containing infectious disease outbreaks, but can be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while existing medical facilities focus on disease treatment. ""Our capabilities are focused on trauma ... they don't have necessarily the segregated spaces that you need to deal with infectious diseases,"" Esper said Tuesday, adding that deploying the hospital ships could ""take the pressure off of civilian hospitals when it comes to trauma cases to open up civilian hospital rooms for infectious diseases."" In addition to the hospital ships, the Pentagon has put on alert 1,000 ""deployable"" beds from a variety of different medical units, said Joint Staff Surgeon Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs. These temporary units are designed to deal with trauma patients, he said. Esper said Wednesday that Army Corps of Engineers officials are in New York meeting with Cuomo to go over options for additional actions. Separately, the Pentagon has opened its 16 certified coronavirus testing labs to test non-DoD personnel, will make available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves and distribute up to 2,000 deployable ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services, Esper said. Meanwhile, the Air Force on Tuesday flew 500,000 swabs used as part of testing kits from Italy to Memphis, Tenn., on a military cargo plane, officials said, confirming a report by Defense One. In Memphis, the shipment was loaded onto FedEx aircraft and distributed per HHS direction around the country, Hoffman said. The Air Force is in discussions to provide additional transport capability for test kits, and to support evacuations with cargo aircraft modified to treat infectious diseases, according to Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein. By invoking the Defense Production Act, the administration would be allowed to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of critical medical supplies. The act, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is designed ""to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs."" ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on Feb. 28.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday began to invoke the rhetoric of “a wartime president” as he told reporters he views himself as one, while his administration fights to contain the spread of coronavirus and mitigate the economic fallout from the global pandemic. “I do, I actually do, I'm looking at it that way,” Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House when asked whether he considered the U.S. to be on a wartime footing. “I look at it, I view it as, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that's what we're fighting.“ Trump has repeatedly referred to U.S. attempts to battle the virus — which has sickened thousands across the U.S. and killed more than 100 — as a “war” against an “invisible enemy.” But during Wednesday’s briefing he went the furthest yet in adopting the rhetoric of a commander in chief during wartime.  At the top of his remarks, the president pointed to the havoc the virus has begun to wreak on the economy, telling reporters in the White House briefing room that the pandemic would require a response unseen since World War II. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” he told reporters, offering examples like teenagers volunteering to fight in the war and workers sleeping on factory floors. “To this day, nobody has ever seen like it, what they were able to do during World War II,” he continued. “Now it's our time. We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together. It's the invisible enemy. That's always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy.” ""It's a very tough situation here. You have to do things,” he explained later. “You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they've ever been. And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy ... but we're doing it and we're doing it well.” The comments coincided with a number of announcements from the president on an expanded coronavirus response across the federal government centered on a mobilization of military resources at the Pentagon as the outbreak worsens. The number of confirmed cases has exploded in recent weeks, with deaths topping 100 for the first time on Tuesday night and one Washington county alone reporting 10 new deaths Wednesday afternoon.  Trump for the first time said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, and announced the deployment of military hospital ships to virus hotspots, though he later wrote in a tweet that he had only done so “should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.“ Additionally, Trump declared that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was now “fully engaged at the highest levels” and operating in every region of the country, though he didn’t elaborate. He also announced that his housing department would temporarily suspend evictions and foreclosures. The unfamiliar rhetoric from Trump came as Congress is speeding to put a second multibillion-dollar emergency aid package on his desk this week before immediately turning to a third package to prop up industries that have been gutted by the outbreak. Trump also announced a slew of other measures aimed at blunting the spread of the virus, including that his administration is looking into self-administered coronavirus tests in an effort to dramatically expand access to tests for the fast-spreading disease. Trump told reporters that his administration is working with “several groups” to determine whether a “self-swab” is as accurate as the tests health providers are currently performing. He added he's pushing for speedy FDA approval of the self-swab test that people can do themselves. He didn’t elaborate on the timeline of getting the diagnostic to market, or who’s producing it. “It would free up a lot,” Trump argued. The new process, he said, would be a “much easier process than the current process that's not very nice to do — I can tell you, because I did it. But we have a current process that's a little bit difficult, if you haven't done.” Trump announced last weekend that the White House physician had tested him for coronavirus late Friday evening. Late Saturday his top spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, issued a memo saying the president did not have the virus. On Wednesday, Trump also said that he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which would significantly increase the production of critical equipment including hospital beds and other medical supplies by allowing the administration to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of critical medical supplies. Officials have repeatedly warned of a shortage of ventilators and respirators to treat patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, as well as masks for health care providers. Administration officials couldn’t clarify how many ventilators are currently available around the country for critically sick COVID-19 patients, and Trump conceded the system was caught off-guard with the shortfall in ventilator supply — calling the situation a “very unforeseen thing.” “We have tremendous numbers of ventilators but there's never been an instance like this, where no matter what you have it’s not enough,” Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence said the government had more than 10,000 ventilators stockpiled to deploy out to hospitals, roughly echoing an estimate from over the weekend from the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had put the number at just under 13,000. The Defense Department pledged on Tuesday to send HHS about 2,000 ventilators to add to its stock — but as growing numbers of hospital report shortages, it’s unclear whether supply can keep up with mounting critical cases.  Several local and state leaders had been pleading with Trump for several days to deploy military resources to assist in fighting the disease, including asking the Army Corps of Engineers to quickly erect hospitals to house coronavirus patients. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said during Wednesday’s briefing that the Army Corps was in New York — which has become the biggest hot spot on the East Coast — meeting with leaders there, while Trump announced that the Pentagon was deploying two military hospital ships: one there and another to an undetermined location on the West Coast. Esper added that he’d put a number of field and expeditionary hospitals on notice for deployment at Trump’s request.  In addition, Trump said that the Department of Housing and Urban development, in an attempt to provide “immediate relief” for homeowners and renters, would be suspending foreclosures and evictions through the end of April. Amid the mad scramble and confusion over shortages in protective gear for front-line hospital workers, the Center on Medicare and Medicaid Services is recommending conservation as of Wednesday. In another attempt to avoid overcrowding in hospitals, Pence and CMS Administrator Seema Verma urged hospitals to delay elective procedures “across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they are needed most.” Verma urged a widespread limit on elective medical visits and surgeries — like dental visits — where clinicians need masks, but announced that more detailed rules would come later in the day, although they won’t be mandatory as some local officials have threatened. “We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients and hospitals prioritize what is essential, while leaving the ultimate decision and the heads of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients,” she said. “And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations. They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines. And it'll protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.” Front-line doctors and nurses are worried specifically about the dwindling supplies of respirator masks, which they need for intubating a critically sick COVID-19 patient to protect themselves against infection. But clinicians treating infectious diseases burn through protective gear quickly, and some doctors have already begun to get sick themselves.  The Defense Department is offering five million masks, but only one million of these are available right away. Trump acknowledged the pressing need, as hospitals continue reporting that they’re days away from running out of their supplies.  “We have targets for masks, the numbers of masks are incredible,” he said. “We've ordered millions of them. But we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested, and we've never had to even think in terms of these numbers. But we need millions of masks and all that will be ordered.” Nearly one-third of nursing homes, whose residents are among those most at risk of dying from the virus, don’t have these masks on hand, nor are they used to supplying them. Also at Wednesday’s briefing, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, sounded a new alarm about data that show young people as well as old are getting seriously ill from COVID-19, flagging concerns based on reports from Italy and France that show some cases of young people in critical hospital care.  “It may have been that the millennial generation — our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades — there may be disproportional numbers of infections among that group,” she said. Birx also sent out an urgent call for young people to stay home if their offices or schools have shuttered, and to conscientiously avoid social gatherings.  “We can't have these large gatherings that constantly do occur throughout the country for people who are off work, to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus,” she said. Photos from earlier in the week showed thousands of people flocking to Florida beaches, where the pandemic didn’t appear to stall spring break activities even as the rest of the country was shutting down. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded Tuesday by ordering a crack-down on beach crowds and warned that beachgoers would have to adhere to the CDC guidelines of social distancing. Despite looking to project a sense of control over the pandemic on Wednesday, Trump rejected challenges to his credibility and a lack of confidence in his handling of the outbreak.  When one reporter pointed to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from the day before that found 60 percent of Americans putting “not very much” or no trust in Trump to handle the crisis, the president pointed to his overall approval rating among Republicans, which has remained high. He then pivoted to a brief attack on former Vice President Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Trump also flatly denied that he’d seen an internal report from the Department of Health and Human Services predicting that the outbreak could stretch as much as 18 months, and sparred with reporters over his recent references to the virus as the “Chinese virus.” Meanwhile, stock markets dove during the White House briefing.  Just before the coronavirus task force wrapped up its briefing, the S&P 500 index hit the 7 percent decline needed to trigger a mandatory 15-minute break under SEC rules — the fourth such triggering of the so-called circuit breaker in two weeks.",Trump labels himself ‘a wartime president’ combating coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-administration-self-swab-coronavirus-tests-135590,politico
"Nearly 500 Homeland Security employees are quarantined because of the novel coronavirus, and at least 13 are confirmed or presumed COVID-19 positive, according to documentation reviewed by POLITICO.   A DHS spokesperson would not to comment on the record for this story. The department previously revealed that eight Transportation Security Administration officers had contracted COVID-19. But the latest numbers are higher and highlight the challenge the novel coronavirus poses to the federal workforce. More than 240,000 people work for DHS, making it the third-largest workforce in the federal government. Many of those employees interact with numerous people every day as part of their work, including employees with Customs and Border Protection and the TSA. “The department’s leadership is going to have to pay very close attention as this public health crisis evolves,” said John Cohen, former acting undersecretary of intelligence and analysis. “It has to be concerned that its ability to carry out its core mission could be compromised if there’s a widespread outbreak of the virus among DHS personnel. And quite frankly, that’s something that federal, state, and local officials need to be concerned about across the board — that this virus will spread among first responders, law enforcement, and Homeland Security personnel, compromising the ability of those organizations to protect the public.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised people to “put distance” between themselves and others if the virus is spreading in their community. Thousands of Americans are following this directive, and numerous workplaces have directed their employees to work from home.  The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents TSA officers, has criticized the department over its handling of the outbreak. The union pushed for them to be able to wear respirators at work, but, according to a statement from AFGE, TSA management refused, only allowing surgical masks.  A TSA spokesperson said the agency is deferring to CDC guidance that such respirators should be reserved for health care workers. The safety of the DHS workforce has also drawn attention from the Hill.  “It’s important to remember that during this pandemic, the DHS workforce is still manning the frontlines, protecting our skies and borders,” House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement. “It’s critical they are properly protected — and the Administration has a long-term plan for this. Not just for their own health and safety, but to ensure we have a fully functional frontline workforce in the months to come.” The diagnoses and quarantines come as DHS employees have faced significant strain under the Trump administration, according to David Lapan, the department’s chief spokesperson for the first nine months of Trump’s presidency.  “Because of the president’s outsized focus on the immigration enforcement part of the DHS mission set — since immigration is not the only thing in DHS’ mission — the organization has been under a lot of strain over the last three years,” he said. “The focus on immigration, lots of attention, lots of presidential pressure, vacancies, changes in leadership, the government shutdown, people having to work without pay — after all of that, add on this pandemic and I think you have cause for concern about a workforce that has been under extended stress now having to endure yet more.”",Documents show undisclosed coronavirus cases at DHS,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/undisclosed-coronavirus-cases-at-homeland-security-135569,politico
"The COVID-19 outbreak is causing massive disruption to the U.S. economy as global supply chains break down, travel is canceled and people practice “social distancing,” avoiding everything from restaurants and retail outlets to conferences and office meetings. One-fifth of U.S. workers already report losing hours or work because of the pandemic.  Worker layoffs are often seen as an inevitable part of an economic crisis like the one we’re living through. Unfortunately, job losses carry a high price for individuals and the economy—laid-off workers have less income to take care of their families, lose access to health insurance and deepen the economic crisis by spending less. And, laying off workers can even slow a recovery when employers must spend valuable time and money to rebuild their workforce as the economy improves.  But, unless a business has been forced to fully close, there’s a way to keep workers on the payroll, ease the pain of a downturn and speed economic recovery. It’s called “work-sharing.”  This is an idea that other countries have used in past downturns to far greater effect than the United States. State and federal officials should act now to ramp up this option here. Twenty-six states covering about 70 percent of the U.S. workforce already have formal programs to provide financial help to employers who embrace shared-work policies; those states need to do more to make employers aware of the option. And states that don’t yet have formal shared-work programs can and should put them in place quickly.  Here’s how work-sharing, or “short-time compensation” programs work. Employers experiencing a temporary reduction in business agree to cut employees’ hours instead of laying off workers entirely. Employees on reduced hours receive unemployment benefits in proportion to the reduction in their hours. Businesses benefit by retaining valued employees and avoiding recruitment and training costs when economic conditions return to normal. Workers benefit by retaining most of their income and access to health insurance — a critical factor in a public health-triggered economic crisis like this one.  By helping to keep people in their jobs, work-share programs mitigate unemployment. And short-time compensation benefits are well targeted, reaching exactly the people who are suffering a drop in earnings and are likely to need the money the most. In this sense, they are better targeted and more likely to provide direct economic stimulus than cutting payroll taxes or sending checks to everyone.  In short, shared-work programs are specifically designed to help businesses and workers—and their communities—get through temporary economic disruptions like those caused by COVID-19.  Business surveys show that employers using shared-compensation programs are overwhelmingly very satisfied with them. The problem is that, even in states with a short-term compensation program, most businesses don’t know about the option. During the Great Recession—a period when shared work could have been helpful to many businesses—relatively few employers operating in states with shared-work programs made use of them. In response, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included provisions to bolster use. Under the law, the federal government funded state marketing to raise employer awareness about the program and reimbursed states’ short-time compensation costs for three years.  Our research shows that even modest efforts to advertise short-time compensation programs can significantly raise employer awareness and use. In large demonstration projects done in cooperation with Oregon and Iowa, we found that low-key advertising campaigns raised employer awareness of the shared-work option by 15 to 30 percentage points. In Oregon, these efforts increased employer participation in work-share plans by 50 to 100 percent. These demonstrations were run during an economic expansion; Outreach should be even more effective during a slowdown—like the one we are currently experiencing.  What should states and the federal government do now to ensure that employers can and will implement work-sharing?  First, states with short-time compensation options should do more to get the word out to employers. Public service announcements, mailings and targeted outreach in industries where sales are especially hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak can be effective ways to quickly reach businesses that might benefit from the program. Federal subsidies could help to spur such outreach.  Second, the federal government should subsidize states’ short-time compensation programs during the COVID-19 crisis. Under existing law, employers’ unemployment insurance tax rates are tied to the past benefits paid to their workers. This means that many employers’ unemployment insurance tax rates will increase if they lay off workers or use work-share programs. Congress should pass legislation providing reimbursement to states for the costs of work-share benefits paid during the current crisis and stipulate that the tax rates of employers who set up short-time compensation plans will not go up. Some employers might choose to reduce employee hours instead of laying off people regardless, but unless they participate in a work-share program, their employees will not have access to prorated unemployment insurance benefits. Removing the tax consequences of participation in work share should increase employer use of this beneficial program that gets money to people who need it.  Third, states without a short-time compensation option should move quickly to adopt it as part of their unemployment insurance system. The current crisis—which we hope will be relatively short-lived—is a perfect example of the circumstances in which short-time compensation can be most helpful to businesses, workers and communities. It’s better for workers and for their communities if temporary downturns don’t turn into permanent job loss. Every state in the country needs this option.  Short-time compensation is a crisis-mitigation tool we already have in our arsenal to fight this pandemic’s economic fallout. Other countries already are taking steps to encourage the use of shared work during this crisis. Federal and state decision-makers need to act quickly to make it available throughout the United States. The health of our population — and our economy — may depend on it.

"Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced Wednesday the state is delaying primary runoff elections that were scheduled for later this month until July 14 because of concerns about coronavirus, delaying the GOP Senate runoff between former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville for more than three months. ""The ability to hold free and fair elections is an inherent right as citizens of the United States and the great state of Alabama, but the safety and wellbeing of Alabama citizens is paramount,"" Ivey said in a statement released by her office. Tuberville and Sessions finished in the top two spots in the March 3 primary and were set to face each other in the March 31 runoff to face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. Ivey's decision delays Republicans nominating a candidate to face Jones for more than three months. The race is Republicans' top offensive target on the Senate map this cycle and has significant implications for which party controls the Senate next year. President Donald Trump endorsed Tuberville after the former football coach earned the top spot in the primary, a blow to Sessions campaign with just weeks until the original runoff date. It's unclear how the postponement will affect the race, although it will likely force both candidates to raise significantly more funds for the intraparty election and delay the beginning of a general election campaign against Jones, who won his party's primary uncontested. Sessions said in a statement that the ""safety and health of Alabamians must take precedence."" He also took a shot at Tuberville, hinting at the implications of a longer primary election between the two candidates. “We intend to maintain our vigorous campaign up until the last day, even as we are careful to do so in a manner that puts the health and safety of the public first,"" Sessions said. ""It will be very difficult for Tommy Tuberville to hide from debates for four months. He will have to conquer his fears, and face me and the voters.” In a statement from his campaign, Tuberville said he understood the decision to delay the election. His campaign did not address Sessions' criticism. ""I understand Gov. Ivey's decision to postpone the runoff until July 14 and join her in encouraging all Alabamians to stay safe, be kind to their fellow citizens and follow all guidelines related to the Coronavirus,"" Tuberville said. ""I pray that the current health crisis will be brought under control and that lives will be saved."" Jones, in a statement, also praised the decision. He called for expanding voting access by enacting early voting and expanding vote-by-mail. Ivey, during a press conference announcing the decision to postpone the runoff, said she did not see a reason to implement no-excuse absentee voting or expanding vote-by-mail, but also encouraged voters to request absentee ballots by citing health concerns over coronavirus. The decision also postpones runoffs between Republicans running in for two open, GOP-leaning congressional seats.",Alabama Senate runoff postponed until July,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/alabama-senate-runoff-postponed-coronavirus-135557,politico

"The coronavirus pandemic has yet to land fully and already some U.S. industries are angling for federal bailouts. The airlines want $60 billion in direct assistance and loan guarantees to counter the passenger fall-off, compared with the $15 billion they received after 9/11. The casino industry has thrust out its hat, as have the cruise lines, the hospitality industry, the oil shale operators and others. While the coronavirus crisis—and all but certain recession—is real and demands emergency action, the government must resist dispensing cash aid to every imperiled industry and faction that petitions for help. No industry, no single company, no individual has an automatic moral claim on the contents of the U.S. Treasury, no matter how severely the crisis has injured their bottom lines. Nor does the federal government have the capacity to restore every industry company and individual to their prior economic standing. Today’s trickle of requests will likely turn into a stampede if the government blindly accedes to corporate requests. Already, entrenched K Street lobbyists are presenting their “asks” to the federal government, as POLITICO’s Theodoric Meyer reports. As we draw the blueprint for how best to enlist the government in rebuilding the wounded economy, let’s study the lessons taught by earlier bailouts so we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. In 2001, the federal government bailed out the airline industry with a $15 billion package. But by 2004, the program’s deficiencies were glaring. The airlines were already in trouble before 9/11, and the bailout propped up the ailing ones at the expense of the healthy ones, as the New York Times reported in a 2004 postmortem. “The bailout program may actually have made matters worse, some experts say, by forestalling a badly needed shakeout in the industry, keeping the weakest carriers alive at the expense of the others and perpetuating a glut of flights and seats,” the Times wrote. CBS News later reported that some of the bailout money went to already bankrupt companies, package delivery fleets and Grand Canyon tour helicopters. Today, and presumably for the coming months, the government is discouraging discretionary travel to beat the virus, which means we won’t need as many airline seats in the short term. The rational thing for the government to do would be to let the weaker airlines go out of business as the stronger but still viable carriers continue flying under Chapter 11 bankruptcy—as they have done in previous airline downturns. A new airline bailout would only repeat 2001’s mistake of preserving the weaker airlines at the expense of the better-run ones. The biggest Washington bailouts have traditionally gone to the largest, most politically connected industries: The railroads, the automakers, aviation, the banks. The Tuesday Washington Post explains how the cruise lines, less crucial to the economy than the railroads, automakers and banks, might soon navigate their way to the federal trough. President Donald Trump counts Carnival Corp. Chairman Micky Arison as a friend. His firm was also an advertiser on Trump’s Apprentice show. The Norwegian Cruise Line has also made friends with the Trumps. It made a $100,000 donation to his foundation in 2005 after Melania Trump christened one of its ships. (She was named the ship’s “godmother.”) Brian Ballard and Pam Bondi, two Trump loyalists, were registered lobbyists for Carnival North American last year. Meanwhile, the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising travelers against taking a cruise. What sort of sense does it make for one branch of the government to discourage cruise travel and another to encourage continued voyages with subsidies? This would be as crazy as the government subsidizing tobacco farmers at the same time it spends millions on discouraging smoking—something that it does. So I guess there’s a precedent, but it’s an insane one.  The fattest target among the bailout pleaders is the casino industry. Trump, by the way, was once a casino owner and counts among his biggest campaign donors the casino megaowner Sheldon Adelson. On Monday, the gambling lobby told the Washington Post that the $260 billion industry was at a “near standstill” and begging for funds to continue. While sympathies should go out to every showgirl, valet, bartender, maid and craps dealer on the Las Vegas strip, it’s unconscionable to use federal money to prop up an industry that serves gamblers! Gambling, like attending a movie or baseball game, is entertainment, and hardly essential to our way of life the way electricity, roadways, food and shelter are. If we’re performing economic triage, there can’t be a worse candidate for a bailout and a better candidate for Chapter 11 reorganization than the casinos. We’ve never bailed out failing entertainment companies before, and this is no time to start. Besides, if we’re going to bail out the casinos, why not bail out MLB, the NBA, the NHL, the Masters golf tournament, the Kentucky Derby and the other sports businesses that have paused their operations (but not yet asked for bailouts)? What’s next? Bailouts for shuttered nightclubs and concert halls? The Regal, Landmark and Alamo movie theaters that just closed? Where does it end? While no request for a bailout or other relief should be categorically rejected, neither should any program of temporary relief become permanent or inviolate. Every bailout and accommodation should come with some sort of sunset provision so that businesses don’t become wards of the state or dependent on government largesse. “Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program,” economist Milton Friedman once wrote. If we make mistakes with our bailouts, we should leave ourselves in a position to correct them quickly. Perhaps there are instances and industries that deserve government handouts. Writing in the Wednesday Washington Post, business columnist Steven Pearlstein makes a guarded case for issuing federally guaranteed loans to select stressed companies that come with stringent conditions: no cash gifts like the airlines and cruise lines appear to want, and terms that should be no better “than if they were seeking capital from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.” In the very short term, we should be gung-ho for subsidizing the making of ventilators, masks and essential medical supplies. There’s also much to commend Mitt Romney and Andrew Yang’s proposal to give every American $1,000 to tide them over until the complexity of the coronavirus crisis is fully understood. But we should approach bailouts and other emergency actions with trepidation and guided by the understanding that anything we bail out now is likely to leave us with one less dollar to bail out something else later.

And why? “I just read an article in Science Magazine about the worry about the spread of COVID-19 in Africa. As attention has turned to the outbreak in the U.S., it reiterated to me what many of us in global health have been thinking about -- that we must also stay focused on how the epidemic grows in low- and middle-income countries where U.S. global health programs operate. We know how outbreaks can have a ripple effect across critical health initiatives and as resources shift to urgent situations, it is near impossible to predict what the broader impact on countries could be.

This likely scenario speaks to an ongoing need for investments in health systems building blocks worldwide.” What’s a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “Maybe at this stage it isn't fair to call COVID-19 a trend that isn't getting enough attention given how the situation has evolved in recent weeks, but many of us in the global health community have been working over the years to call attention to the threat of a pandemic like this. We need to figure out how to break the cycle of experts pointing at all of the warning signs, and real attention on preparedness and response not happening until too late. If we have learned anything from past outbreaks like Zika and Ebola, it’s that there will be more to protect beyond a basic emergency response.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday insisted that he was justified in branding the coronavirus pandemic as the ""Chinese Virus,"" disregarding criticism that the label is racially offensive and inaccurately depicts the global nature of the disease's threat. ""It's not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,"" Trump told reporters at the White House coronavirus task force’s daily news briefing as he was pressed on his repeated use of the term. Earlier Wednesday, the president invoked the controversial descriptor in three morning Twitter posts, initially assuring Americans forced out of work by the burgeoning outbreak that the ""onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault!"" Trump then wrote that he would be holding a news conference to discuss an announcement from the Food and Drug Administration ""concerning the Chinese Virus"" and claimed he had ""always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,"" despite his previous comments minimizing its risk to the country.  Trump first employed ""Chinese Virus"" online Monday and again Tuesday, lamenting the industries and states that have been affected by the pandemic, which he had until then stylized as the ""CoronaVirus"" in messages on social media. He also mentioned the ""Chinese Virus"" in his opening remarks at a White House meeting with tourism industry executives on Tuesday, as well as at the outset of Wednesday's briefing. The president's decision to switch labels for the coronavirus comes after he referred to COVID-19 as a ""foreign virus"" in an Oval Office address last Wednesday, and represents another apparent attempt to deflect blame for the public health crisis. Trump last Friday charged without evidence that former President Barack Obama was responsible for the current administration's failure to test large numbers of Americans for the coronavirus, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, remarking, ""I don't take responsibility at all."" He also insisted Monday that the coronavirus is ""nobody’s fault, unless you go to the original source,"" and said Tuesday that ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic"" — an assertion that did not square with his past attempts to downplay the threat. Trump's adoption of ""Chinese Virus"" is a twist on the phrase ""Wuhan virus,"" which gained some prominence in news reporting on the outbreak and has since been echoed by White House allies and administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who note that the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, a city in China's central province of Hubei. Chinese officials have lashed out over the word choice, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang last Monday condemning ""the despicable practice of individual U.S. politicians eagerly stigmatizing China and Wuhan by association with the novel coronavirus, disrespecting science and WHO,"" according to The Washington Post. American officials in turn have accused China of spreading misinformation by hinting without evidence that the disease may have originated in the U.S.  ""I have a great love for all the people from our country, but as you know, China tried to say at one point that — maybe they've stopped now — that it was caused by American soldiers,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""That can't happen. It's not going to happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China."" Still, the president's language has been met with resistance from other administration officials. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar committed that he would no longer ascribe a nationality or region to the outbreak, saying during congressional testimony last month that ""ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus."" Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's emergency program, also emphasized Wednesday that ""viruses know no borders"" and scolded Trump for his statements regarding the ""Chinese Virus."" ""It's really important that we be careful in the language we use, lest it lead to profiling of individuals,"" Ryan said in Geneva. ""This is something we need to all avoid. I'm sure anyone would regret profiling a virus along ethnic lines.""  Democratic lawmakers have raised similar objections. ""I've said it once & I'll say it again loud enough for the @WhiteHouse, @FoxNews, & everyone else to hear: coronavirus does not discriminate. Bigotry against people of Asian descent is unacceptable, un-American, & harmful to our COVID-19 response efforts,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted Tuesday. During Wednesday's briefing, the president was asked about increased incidents of anti-Asian discrimination in the wake of the pandemic, including an account by CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that an unnamed White House official ""referred to #Coronavirus as the 'Kung-Flu' to my face.""  But Trump denied that his use of the term ""Chinese Virus"" put Asian Americans at risk. ""No, not all. I think they probably would agree with it 100 percent. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree,"" he said. Some on Capitol Hill have also defended the president's rhetoric as they admonish the authoritarian government in Beijing for its handling of the outbreak. ""I don't understand why China gets upset bc we refer to the virus that originated there [as] the 'Chinese virus,'"" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote Wednesday on Twitter. ""Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918&1919."" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said Monday on Fox News that ""anyone who complains that it's racist or xenophobic to call this virus the 'Chinese coronavirus' or the 'Wuhan virus' is a politically correct fool."" Cotton, who has floated the unsubstantiated theory that the coronavirus was manufactured by the Chinese in a bioweapons lab, also warned in an ominous statement last Thursday that the U.S. ""will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.""  Trump said Wednesday that he did not believe China was ""inflicting"" the coronavirus upon Americans, but argued that Beijing ""could have given us a lot earlier notice"" about the disease. ""I know where it came from. I don't know if you'd say China is to blame,"" the president said. ""Certainly we didn't get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier. But it comes from China. It's not a question about that. Nobody's questioning it.""",Trump on 'Chinese virus' label: 'It's not racist at all',2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-pandemic-drumbeat-coronavirus-135392,politico
"Don’t be fooled by the barren grocery store shelves: There’s plenty more food on the way. Meat, dairy and produce groups as well as federal regulators say the U.S. has an ample amount of products in cold storage to handle the unexpected demand for food and household products from Americans. The latest Agriculture Department data shows record-high stocks of frozen poultry, cheeses like American and Swiss and red raspberries, while frozen pork supplies are up 11 percent from last year. Rice producers, whose grains have been flying off of store shelves along with other inexpensive and long-lasting foods, say there’s no shortage and those items are being “quickly replenished.” “If you see depleted rice shelves in your local grocery store, it is not a supply problem; it is a signifier of changing logistics in the retail market,” said USA Rice President Betsy Ward in a statement. On Tuesday, federal meat inspection agencies said they continue to operate as normal. Food imports continued to flow across the Southern border despite restrictions on nonessential travel. And the Trump administration and grocery executives stressed that the supply chain is holding firm, even if consumers see long lines at stores across the country. Top retail chains like Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B have reduced store hours to give workers more time to restock high-demand products overnight, and agriculture groups insist there’s no threat of food shortages. Amazon, the largest online retailer, announced it would hire an additional 100,00 workers in its U.S. warehouses to help handle increased demand for household staples, including groceries, while temporarily halting intake of nonessential goods at distribution centers through April 5. Meanwhile, the White House and Congress are on the verge of what could be a $1 trillion stimulus package for workers and industries like airlines and small businesses. It will likely include at least $1 billion in extra food assistance, which could see more demand as restaurant workers, service employees and other Americans are laid off or forced to stay home for an indefinite amount of time. The food industry, for its part, is urging consumers to remain calm and avoid hoarding, suggesting that fears of shortages are overblown. “This is a demand issue, not a supply issue,” said Heather Garlich, vice president of media and public relations at FMI, the food industry association formerly known as the Food Marketing Institute. “The supply chain isn’t broken. The warehouses are pushing out as much inventory as possible in a 24-hour period.” Meat supplies have not been disrupted as processing plants continue to operate, according to USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service and groups representing major meat firms like Smithfield Foods and Cargill. FSIS is required by law to be present at more than 6,200 plants across the country. It employs about 7,800 inspectors to ensure the safety of meat, poultry and processed eggs. Without federal inspectors, plants can’t process the more than 330 billion pounds of beef, chicken, pork, lamb and turkey produced annually. Planning for absenteeism is a regular part of its food safety operations and the department is closely tracking the status of employees who are sick or out for other reasons, USDA said in a statement on Tuesday. Mindy Brashears, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for food safety, assured the agriculture industry that the department is protecting the health and safety of employees while still delivering services to keep the food supply moving. “Field personnel will be working closely with establishment management and state and local health authorities to handle situations as they arise in your community,” Brashears said in a letter. “As always, communication between industry and government will be key. We are all relying on early and frequent communication with one another to overcome challenges as they arise."" Sarah Little, spokesperson for the North American Meat Institute, said if plants are closed because of staffing shortages other facilities will likely pick up some of that capacity. “It is impossible to predict, however, the scenarios for individual plants across the nation,” she said. “Many companies are operating normally but they have contingency plans to address the threat of coronavirus.” At the retail level, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told CNBC that grocery stores are “getting deliveries every day,” including household goods like toilet paper, though he acknowledged there’s a shortage of hand sanitizers with “very little coming in."" McMullen spoke to President Donald Trump on Sunday along with other top grocers and food manufacturers, and he said he urged the president to spread the message to consumers that “there’s plenty of food in the supply chain.” Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain, is also considering giving seniors and shoppers with medical conditions exclusive access to stores for an hour in the morning, allowing them to avoid crowds later in the day. “We’re starting to test it in a few markets in the next couple of days to see how it works,” McMullen said. “If it works well, we’ll expand it to other markets as well.” Laura Strange, a spokesperson for the National Grocers Association, which represents independent grocery stores, said the group’s members are hiring cashiers and staffing up for round-the-clock restocking. “It’s really an all-hands-on-deck situation where everyone is lending a helping hand where they can,” including CEOs stocking shelves and manning cash registers, Strange said. Anthony Hucker, CEO of Southeastern Grocers, whose brands include Winn-Dixie, told CNBC in a separate interview that his stores have seen demand for certain items spike as much as 200 percent, but they’re well versed in handling those surges. Hucker said they’ve “built a very strong muscle, especially around our computer-generated ordering systems,” after dealing with catastrophic hurricanes in recent years. He said fresh foods like produce, seafood and deli products sourced from local suppliers are readily available to shoppers. The U.S. imports nearly half of its fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico. Of the $26 billion worth of agricultural goods shipped across the southern border each year, more than $13 billion is produce. As of Tuesday, fresh produce continued to flow across the Arizona border without any hiccups, said Jaime Chamberlain, president of a distributing company in Nogales, Ariz., that sources peppers, squash, tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables from 14 growers in Mexico. Chamberlain is also board chairman of the Greater Nogales and Santa Cruz County Port Authority, through which about $3.5 billion worth of food and 360,000 trucks pass annually, he said. “So far there are no disruptions,” Chamberlain said. “We’re in the middle of our produce season. It’s typical. Things are in short supply because of the enormous demand and some weather issues this spring, but our growing season is the same.” Chamberlain said his business has experienced a drop in sales to restaurant and food service sectors like hotels and cruise lines, but grocery retailers have made up for those losses. He added that he expects international trade will continue, even if Trump bans travel between the U.S. and Mexico, similar to the current restrictions on the EU. However, heightened travel restrictions for passengers can also weigh on imports of fresh foods like berries flown in from other continents, according to Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition. “Much of the capacity for air cargo is at the bottom of passenger flights,” he said. “Now, because there’s no passengers on the top of the plane, a lot of those airlines are just not flying those planes, and therefore we’ve lost a lot of capacity to bring air cargo into the U.S.” Friedmann said the “severe backup in the global supply chain” emanating from China — which shut down factories and ports earlier this year, causing trans-Pacific shipments to plummet — has also led to logjams throughout the U.S. He also called on federal transport regulators to loosen trucking rules for food and farm goods amid the crisis, like they did for medical devices and other items needed to address the outbreak. “We need to have that same [flexibility] for agriculture, for food, because it will reduce congestion,” Friedmann said. “We’ll be able to more dependably supply supermarkets and other places where the product needs to go.” One potential threat to the food supply is the temporary shutdown of U.S. embassies and consulates in Mexico, effective Wednesday, which help process visas for seasonal farm workers, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The U.S. agriculture industry has already been dealing with chronic labor shortages for at least a decade, and without comprehensive immigration reform, has increasingly relied on the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program. Applications for H-2A visas jumped by nearly 11 percent in fiscal 2019 over the previous year. The visas are to fill more than 257,000 jobs in states like Florida and California where much of America’s produce is harvested, according to Labor Department data. “The decision to halt visa application processing in Mexico will restrict the number of immigrant workers being allowed to enter the country,” Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall said in a statement Tuesday. “Under the new restrictions, American farmers will not have access to all of the skilled immigrant labor needed at a critical time in the planting season. This threatens our ability to put food on Americans’ tables.” Duvall said he has urged the Trump administration to find “practical ways” to admit farm laborers under emergency visas while still protecting public health. Immigrant laborers with previous work experience in the U.S. and who do not require in-person interviews will be allowed to return in the H-2A program. Friedmann, of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, suggested it could take months to unwind the knots in the food and agricultural network, but cargo can be rerouted and other changes can be made. “The agriculture supply chain is like water. It will find the path of least resistance,” he said.",No need to hoard: There’s plenty of food in the system,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/food-supply-coronavirus-135481,politico
"Will a president with authoritarian tendencies actually try to suspend a constitutionally mandated presidential election? That’s the question Americans asked in the spring and summer of 1970. At the end of the 1960s, a wave of violence—domestic terrorism, urban riots, assassinations and rising crime—set the public on edge. A presidential panel, decrying a national “crisis of violence,” found that 41,000 bombings or bomb threats had occurred in the U.S. in the preceding 15 months. Richard Nixon—whose abuses of presidential power would ultimately lead to his resignation—struck his critics as so heedless of democratic norms and the rules of fair play that he was capable of attempting almost anything. Today, people are starting to ask the same questions. The fiasco over Ohio’s scheduled Democratic primary—with the governor and a judge waging an eleventh-hour war over whether it should proceed—and other states’ postponement of their primaries could well be a preview of a looming constitutional donnybrook over November’s vote. If the coronavirus is still largely unchecked this fall, the crowds necessitated by a presidential election would pose a huge threat to public health. Worst of all, because President Donald Trump has repeatedly shown contempt for the rule of law and the spirit of democracy, it’s not unreasonable to worry that he could try to use the pandemic as a pretext to cancel the election and remain in power. Unless Congress acts quickly to provide for nationwide early, absentee and mail-in voting this fall, these fears will surely multiply. The story of Nixon and the canceled-election rumor of 1970 shows why. That year, political violence, combined with the age-old suspicion that Nixon’s regard for the Constitution was less than sincere, spawned a rumor that he was planning to cancel the 1972 elections. Rumors are by nature hard to trace, but by one account, this one originated with the countercultural journalist and provocateur Paul Krassner. As early as 1969, Krassner began telling college audiences that, while stoned on LSD at a party, he’d been told by the wife of an executive at the Rand Corporation, the defense-industry think tank, that the Nixon administration had ordered a study of the consequences of canceling the elections. After circulating among students for many months, the rumor seems first to have landed in print on April 5, in the chain of newspapers owned by the Newhouse family: the Staten Island Advance, the Oregonian and others. According to the squib that ran in these papers, the administration had tasked Rand with studying whether “rebellious factions using force or bomb threats would make it unsafe to conduct an election,” as well as how the president should respond. The journalist Ron Rosenbaum, then a young reporter for the Village Voice, heard about the Newhouse article indirectly, from a Staten Island cab driver who had seen it in the Advance. Rosenbaum looked into it. Eleven days later, he reported in the Voice that Rand and the administration both denied that any such study existed. But he then mischievously pointed out that they would surely deny it if it were true. Rosenbaum added that the country would just have to wait until 1972 to see. Whether or not Rosenbaum’s cheeky tone encouraged the rumors, or simply failed to quash them, other publications were soon running with the story—from the alternative Los Angeles Free Press to the Nation. Most treated the tale with due skepticism, but some of the more marginal publications presented the study as established fact. The rumor spread fast, assuming sinister connotations. One group called the Urban Coalition claimed that Nixon had commissioned not only the Rand study but also a second study, from MIT, to survey how voters would react to an announcement of suspended elections. Another version of the rumor held that Nixon, to ensure he had pretext for the move, was arranging for provocateurs to instigate acts of violence, to create his own version of the infamous 1933 Reichstag fire, which many people believed to have been a Nazi act designed to justify a power grab (what today might be called a “false flag” operation). “The burning of government buildings in Germany, though first blamed on Communist arson, has since been exposed as the act of Hitler himself,” comedian and activist Dick Gregory wrote (not quite accurately) in the Freedom News, an underground publication. Nixon, he intimated, was about to do the same. Nixon administration officials realized the rumor was gaining strength. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then serving as a White House domestic policy aide, tried to squelch the talk in a Fordham University commencement address he gave that spring. In his speech, he said that he knew the story had reached “just about every campus in the nation” and, ever the sociologist, chalked up its currency to students’ “growing distrust of all social institutions.” Moynihan reassured his audience that the report was “not so.” But then—either playing for a laugh or falling victim himself to the pervasive mistrust—he added: “Or at least I think that it is not so.” Like Rosenbaum, Moynihan couldn’t summon enough confidence in Nixon to deny the rumor categorically. At some level, he had to concede that the Nixon-hating conspiracy theorists might well be on to something. His remarks, too, failed to put the concerns to rest. In July, a new left-wing, countercultural magazine called Scanlan’s Monthly—run by Warren Hinckle, formerly of Ramparts, and Sidney Zion, formerly of the New York Times—joined the fracas. Scanlan’s claimed to have obtained one page of a memo allegedly written by an aide to Vice President Spiro Agnew. The memo, which Scanlan’s published in its August issue, was dated March 11, 1970, and referred to three possible schemes being planned by the administration. The first was to cancel the 1972 elections under the ostensible threat of violence, but in reality to keep the administration in power. The second was to secretly orchestrate pro-administration rallies by labor groups that would purport to be spontaneous. By the time Scanlan’s shared the contents of this supposed memo, Americans knew that the administration had in fact collaborated with labor groups to stage anti-anti-war events in the spring. That knowledge seemed to give the whole memo a whiff of plausibility. The final item in the allegedly official memo was that Nixon would eventually “repeal” the Bill of Rights. Scanlan’s advertised its “scoop” heavily. At one point, a New York Times reporter asked Agnew about the memo. The vice president erupted in anger, denouncing it as “completely false” and thereby ensuring his reaction would be covered in the paper. But Zion—whether truly convinced of the memo’s authenticity or, more likely, eager to perpetuate a hoax that was winning attention for his fledgling magazine—did not back down. “The document came directly from Mr. Agnew’s office, and he knows it. We do not hesitate to submit our credibility against his,” he said. A week later, Attorney General John Mitchell also denied and denounced the story at a breakfast meeting with reporters, possibly giving it even more oxygen. Nixon personally became so incensed about the rumor, according to White House aide John Dean, that he ordered an audit of the magazine—though as a brand new publication, it turned out, it had yet to file taxes. It’s doubtful that many people expected Nixon to suspend the election, let alone repeal the Bill of Rights. The journalists who inspected the alleged Agnew memo mostly judged it a hoax. But its authenticity mattered less than the fact that so many people considered it plausible that Nixon might entertain a power grab at all. The Nation, while stopping short of accepting the rumor, grouped it with such recent “internal security” measures as stepped-up wiretapping and infiltration. Calling Nixon “an old-time Red-hunter,” the editors argued that he was “inclined by temperament in that direction himself.” Ron Rosenbaum, in a follow-up to the pieces he wrote the previous spring, maintained that “the Rand rumor is metaphorically and cosmically true, even if proven mundanely false.” During the Nixon era, he argued, entertaining paranoid fantasies made a certain amount of sense. It is very unlikely that Trump could get away with postponing the November elections; who knows if he even wants to try. But as the Nixon example shows, that doesn’t mean we won’t all be talking about this as a live possibility as our crisis worsens. Presidents who make a show of flouting norms and arrogating power shouldn’t be surprised when large portions of the population assumes that when the crunch comes, they’ll do more of the same.",Could Trump Try to Cancel the 2020 Election?,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/could-trump-try-to-cancel-the-2020-election-134349,politico
"Washington is mobilizing to rescue the country from potentially disastrous economic consequences from the global coronavirus outbreak, with the Senate on Wednesday passing a multi-billion dollar emergency package and quickly getting to work on a larger stimulus agreement. With Senate leaders vowing to work at “warp speed” to blunt the financial fallout from the pandemic, the Treasury Department unveiled to lawmakers a plan for $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6.  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans were inching closer on Wednesday to unveiling their proposal for a third, even larger stimulus package to address the epidemic, which is likely to include some of Treasury's ideas. The Senate’s approval Wednesday of the House-passed coronavirus bill, known as “phase two,” comes as Republican senators are expected to begin negotiations with Democrats on a trillion-dollar “phase three” stimulus package as early as Wednesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell backed the House bill, which grants paid sick leave to hourly employees and expands unemployment insurance. “It is a well-intentioned bipartisan product assembled by House Democrats and President Trump’s team that tries to stand up and expand some new relief measures for American workers,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said of the House bill, which House lawmakers passed early Saturday and later approved technical corrections on Monday. Despite “real shortcomings” in the legislation, McConnell said, “in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.” Earlier Wednesday, the White House sent a proposal to the Senate with a list of potential policy options discussed at a meeting the previous day, a senior administration official said. According to the Treasury Department’s proposal, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, the so-called “phase three” proposal would include $50 billion to aid the hard-hit airline industry, $150 billion for other distressed sectors of the economy, two rounds of direct payments of $250 billion each on April 6 and May 18, and the creation of a small business interruption loan program. The document notably does not mention a payroll tax cut, which President Donald Trump has suggested he wanted to be included in the package. But the idea lost steam in recent days as lawmakers from both parties rejected the idea, citing the need to grant immediate, large-scale relief. “There are a lot of steps along the way here, but I think everybody has the motivation to get to a solution as quickly as possible,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said. “There are lots of wheels in motion — hopefully driving in the right direction.” As the coronavirus spreads across the country and the stock market continues to plunge, there is widespread recognition that the Senate needs to act swiftly and assist individuals as well as small businesses as part of the massive aid package expected to be unveiled in the coming days. McConnell has been adamant that the Senate will not leave Washington until it passes the “phase three” package. McConnell created three so-called “task forces” to come up with specific proposals to assist small businesses as they deal with the plummeting demand that comes with the lockdown orders in several cities across the country. At Senate Republicans’ lunch meeting on Wednesday, members of each task force presented the proposals they are working on, according to an attendee. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) discussed direct payments to Americans, which could potentially include an income cap. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) talked about his small business proposal and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) discussed the deferment of student loans — potentially for up to three months, the attendee said. In a sign of the personal precautions members are taking against the coronavirus, McConnell urged his colleagues to avoid congregating on the Senate floor and to leave the chamber as soon as each of them voted on Wednesday. While no lawmaker reportedly has contracted the virus, several senators have self-quarantined after possible exposure. At least one Senate staffer has tested positive for the coronavirus. And senators are continuing to urge Trump to take drastic actions usually only taken during wartime. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on the president to invoke the Defense Production Act, which could significantly increase the production of critical equipment, including hospital beds and other medical supplies. Trump later announced he was doing just that. “If you ignore the public health crisis with the equipment and infrastructure and personnel that is needed in many more numbers than we’ve ever seen, the economy won’t get better,” said Schumer, who spoke by phone with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the ""phase three"" package, according to a spokesman. During a meeting with Republican senators on Tuesday, Mnuchin warned that the unemployment rate could spike to double digits if Congress doesn't take action, according to a source familiar with the remarks. House Democrats are also drafting a third stimulus bill to act as a counter-offer to the ""phase three"" package senators are currently drafting.  Democratic lawmakers and aides say the House plan could include expanded Medicaid coverage, additional unemployment insurance payments, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, an airline rescue package and additional food security measures.  Democrats familiar with the proposal said the plan won't be completed until next week, and it remains unclear if Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring the House back to Washington to vote.  In the meantime, some Senate Democrats are already laying out their demands for the stimulus package. They’re warning that Congress’ third phase of aid must include a far more broad paid sick leave policy, or it will not clear the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to pass. “In the next package, all of us are insisting that this provision on paid sick leave and family leave be part of it,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash) said on a conference call with reporters. “It’s a non-starter if it’s not included in the next package,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), another long-time proponent of paid sick leave. “That next tranche of investment in the economy is going to require 60 votes. If it's not included, I don't believe Democratic support will be for the measure.”  Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle and Nancy Cook contributed to this report.

"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  George echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"A plunging stock market. Restaurants, gyms and movie theaters shutting their doors. Workers losing more income each day. It’s an unprecedented public crisis, and it’s also billions of dollars in state tax revenue that’s evaporating quickly — and scrambling the economic equation for governors and mayors across the nation. The cascading impacts of the novel coronavirus come just as governors, state lawmakers, mayors and city councils would normally be hammering out their budget plans for the coming year. But with no telling how long the coronavirus pandemic will shut down everyday life, a crystal ball may prove as effective as economic formulas for the fiscal year ahead. Governors of both parties are now calling on President Donald Trump and Congress to step in with billions in federal aid and reductions in red tape. They'd also be wise to dust off their playbooks from more than a decade ago when the Great Recession last caused revenues to nose-dive with little notice. Starting in the fall of 2008, California wrote and rewrote its budget three times in less than a year because projections quickly went into the dustbin within months of printing a new spending plan. Leaders in states across the nation are bracing for a similar year of drafting their documents in pencil, knowing that the situation will be hard to pin down until the world emerges from hibernation. Unlike the federal government, states and cities must balance their budgets each year. Some states, like California, may be better prepared to weather the storm, sitting on a surplus and $20 billion reserve fund built after lessons learned from the previous downturn. But others will have to figure out which programs to cut for the first time in years. Illinois, for instance, doesn’t even have a rainy day fund. That was on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s wish list for this year’s legislative session — which has now been put on hold. States such as New York are already talking about building contingencies into their spending plan. Trigger cuts — a well-worn tool during the last recession — are already entering the conversation. Washington, of course, can use its borrowing powers where states can't, as it did during the 2008-09 recession with a massive public works package intended to create jobs and buoy local economies. Congress and the Trump administration are now discussing a package of more than $1 trillion in stimulus, and state and local leaders have begun to press for emergency federal aid to support sectors from transportation to dining. “We’re going to need the federal government with us in a big way,” said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who expects states will ultimately need collective federal aid of $3 trillion to $4 trillion. “And I think everybody recognizes that — and I don’t mean just New Jersey. We’re going to need help. This is beyond any one state.” But Democrats in particular wonder if the Trump administration will be eager to increase funding to areas it previously slated for cuts, such as Medicaid and social service programs that would serve as a safety net for those hit hardest by coronavirus economic damage. POLITICO’s reporters in state capitals and major cities throughout the country are watching the budget and economic impact of the pandemic closely — here’s a look at what’s happening in several major states. Florida’s leaders are used to planning their budgets around hurricane-induced disasters and even oil spills. Coronavirus is different: Economists in the Republican-led Sunshine State say it’s difficult to forecast how hard the virus will hit the state’s tourism-dependent economy — the fourth biggest in the country — with theme parks and beaches now shuttered. The pandemic played a big-money role as the Legislature wrapped up its two-month legislative session last weekend — lawmakers scaled back planned tax cuts and boosted the state’s $3.9 billion cash reserves by $300 million to prepare for the coronavirus response. The state has set aside $50 million for bridge loans, and laid-off employees can apply for unemployment assistance. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who came to power as a close Trump ally, delivered a rebuke to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on March 17 after the secretary said the federal stimulus package should include rules to keep money from going to millionaires who don’t need it. DeSantis said federal red tape could delay aid for months. An early version of a House stimulus bill now scheduled to go before the Senate sought to distribute funds through the Social Security Administration. DeSantis said he told has told Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that the first federal stimulus bill should be packed with assistance for people who will be left jobless. It also should include more bridge loan money for small businesses facing closure, he said. The full picture of the coronavirus impact in Florida might not come into focus for some time. Lawmakers decided on $300 million in added reserves before Walt Disney Co. and NBCUniversal closed theme parks in Orlando and cities including Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach closed beaches that were packed with spring break revelers. (For context, $3 billion of the state’s forecasted $36.5 billion in general revenue this year was expected to come from tourism sales tax revenue.) Gov. Gavin Newsom insists his state is better prepared than most to deal with a downturn. California is working with a $222.2 billion budget and a record surplus and reserves. But the nation’s most populous state, which has the fifth largest economy in the world, is heavily dependent on tax revenue from wealthy earners and hence capital gains — making it particularly vulnerable to stock market swings. So expect a wild ride. Last week, the UCLA Anderson Forecast lowered its expectations for GDP growth and trade but stopped short of predicting a recession. By Monday, UCLA economists had changed their minds. Monday’s revised report said the U.S. economy has entered a recession expected to last until September, and that California will suffer more than most. California is expected to lose more than 280,000 payroll jobs by the first quarter of 2021, with more than a third of those in the leisure, hospitality, transportation and warehousing sectors, according to the report. State Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek, an influential voice on the state budget, said that “while the impact on state revenues is not yet clear, the extreme market volatility and rapidly weakening economic situation obviously have negative implications.” He issued a memo Wednesday projecting ""several billion dollars"" less in capital gains through mid-2021 and said the state would likely have to delay budget passage beyond its June 15 deadline. Still, Petek pointed to California's robust reserve fund as a buffer against potential budget cuts. Christopher Thornberg, founder of Beacon Economics in Los Angeles, is taking an optimistic approach. While this is unprecedented at a national level, he said, regions have bounced back from such natural disasters fairly quickly. It’s not necessarily like the 2008 financial crisis, which had a long-term impact on the economy and permanent loss of jobs, he said. “It’s business delayed, not business canceled. It’s spending delayed, not spending canceled,” Thornberg said. “If we’re looking at four weeks, it’s a hurricane. But to be clear, if this goes 40 weeks, California is not in a good position. … Our revenue system in the state is so hypersensitive to shifts in capital gains that if the stock market really did stay down where it is right now, we’re going to take a massive hit.” New York’s economy faces a massive hit: In a best-case scenario, tax revenues will likely be $4 billion lower than projected for the coming fiscal year, the state comptroller says, and New York City alone faces at least a $3.2 billion hit to its bottom line as travel dwindles and restaurants, bars and theaters close indefinitely, a steep loss in tax revenue that will extend for six months. Financing the massive coronavirus response, meanwhile, is going to upend Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s previously planned efforts to fill a major Medicaid budget hole. State leaders are scrambling to finish their state budget this week, but Cuomo said the original forecast is practically moot now with an expected economic downturn in weeks and months to come. The state was already staring down a roughly $6 billion budget gap, primarily due to a $4 billion Medicaid shortfall. Cuomo’s plan to address that relied on limiting the amount of local spending on Medicaid that is picked up by the state. But the second federal coronavirus bill — which would give the state billions of dollars — would make that strategy ""impossible,"" the governor complained over the weekend, because it contains language prohibiting any changes to localities' reimbursement rates. Sources close to the legislation say Cuomo is working with the New York delegation for language in additional federal coronavirus bills to allow him flexibility to move forward with his Medicaid savings plan. The state’s comptroller, Tom DiNapoli, has long suggested New York's reserves are not built up to withstand disaster or severe economic downturn. The budget Cuomo proposed would get the two largest statutory reserve funds to under $2.5 billion, about 3.1 percent of General Fund expenditures, and far below other large states such as California, Texas and Michigan. In the City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom since taking office in 2014; he’s expanded the city budget from $75 billion six years ago to a proposed $95.3 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. That streak has now ended this month, with a city economy dependent on tourism and entertainment grinding to a halt. As bad as the picture is now for the city, it still has room to get worse. De Blasio and Cuomo are looking at plans to potentially shut down roads, bridges, tunnels and trains to halt travel in and out of the city. That would drain city coffers further and could have ripple effects for national and global markets. Texas is used to booms and busts in the oil and gas sector blowing a hole in the state’s $110 billion annual budget. It’s got a rainy day fund that has more than $11 billion. “The ups and downs are nothing new for us,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park, which has a Shell manufacturing site. “It’s a normal part of the budgeting process. I’m not overly concerned.” But the oil and gas downturn is coming at the same time as the outbreak — meaning that state budget writers will have to make some tough decisions when they gather in Austin for the next session in January. An oil production tax provides 6.1 percent of the state’s revenue and natural gas production tax generates 2.7 percent. That, combined with an expected plunge in sales tax from shuttered restaurants, hotels and businesses and a lack of income tax, means Texas will have a tough time cushioning the blow. Typically, state budget writers have blunted oil price busts by drastically cutting services like education. But the state, which has the highest uninsured rate in the country, is lagging in its response to the outbreak, meaning that the virus spread could stretch thin hospitals and other services. Lawmakers will have to figure out where to get the money to help hospitals and providers while boosting health services. If Democrats take the majority in the state House this year, they will insist on not balancing the budget on the backs of low-income residents. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said that he expects the federal government to throw the state a financial lifeline — as it did after Hurricane Harvey. Illinois is particularly vulnerable budgetwise. Not only does it not have a rainy day fund, but the state a few years ago also passed a constitutional amendment that restricts the use of motor fuel fees and taxes to road construction and repair only. So Illinois has much less flexibility than other states in funneling money to a fund to respond to the impacts of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, which is grappling with a $30 billion unfunded pension debt, relies on tax revenues from conventions, tourism and hotel and restaurant activities. The city has already lost at least 20 conventions, with a combined 200,000 visitors, as a result of the 30-day ban on gatherings of 1,000 or more. (The governor has since put the ban at no more than 50 people.) “This is putting a severe dent in those industries. With Chicago being the economic engine of the state of Illinois, putting that engine in neutral while we’re navigating the social isolation necessary to combat the coronavirus puts state and local finances in a very precarious position,” said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government watchdog that is often called to testify and provide independent opinions about state and city finances. Msall said the situation is reminiscent of the economic impacts of the attacks of 9/11. “The difference is in 9/11, we knew we needed to secure against additional attacks and rebuild. Here, we don’t know when the virus will stop attacking or when it will be effectively limited — and when people can socialize again and when businesses can conduct normal operations, when entertainment, colleges, universities and schools can reopen.” In New Jersey, the economic fallout could quickly eat through the state’s $1.5 billion projected surplus, which amounts to just 3.8 percent of the state’s current $39.9 billion budget. The revenue estimates used to project the surplus made no assumptions about any economic downturn, let alone the coronavirus, and state officials don’t immediately plan to announce an updated forecast. Murphy, who has fought with fellow Democrats in the Legislature over his proposal to raise taxes on millionaires, suggested that some sort of revenue raise could be needed. Still, he said, the damage could be far more than New Jersey could handle on its own. Extending the state’s top tax rate to those earning from $1 million to $5 million would raise less than $500 million a year, based on those now-outdated projections. Murphy is working with the state's congressional delegation to lobby for federal aid in the form of block grants. In the short term, the Wall Street selloff could temper income tax losses when tax season rolls around in 2021, but a drop in dividends and, more importantly, mass layoffs are sure to suck hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars out of the state’s coffers. The state collects sales tax on all online sales, potentially stabilizing that major revenue source. State Senate President Steve Sweeney proposed on Saturday a two-month holiday from the state sales and payroll taxes and deferral of other taxes, including property taxes — a potential short-term hit to local governments. Murphy said the state may not be able to afford it. The Boston marathon may be postponed, but Massachusetts lawmakers maneuvered around questions of how coronavirus will impact the state budget early this week, calling the situation ""fluid."" Officials said instead they are focused on legislation to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, and closed the State House to visitors other than elected officials and staffers. Massachusetts hammers out its budget details over the course of the spring, but the state is used to having its budget come late into the summer.

"A president who shaped his first three years in office trying to sell Americans on obscure corporate tax provisions, minute details of tariffs and the rollback of mind-numbing regulations has a new approach: Keep it simple. Facing the most sudden economic crisis to hit any modern American leader, President Donald Trump is now pushing to send Americans four-figure checks, establish broad corporate bailout programs and lend billions of dollars to small businesses so they can keep paying their bills. The crisis approach jettisons long-held Republican philosophies about using the tax code — and the tax code alone — to reward businesses and individuals for certain types of economic behavior.  It’s a sharp reversal for a GOP that just weeks ago was railing against socialism. The new raft of proposals adopts philosophies popularized by a field of Democratic presidential candidates, like showering the public with government money and imposing strict conditions on corporate welfare.  “Both the White House and the Democrats tend to believe that helping workers affected by the shutdown with direct cash payments is the best and is the right strategy,” said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. “Now, not every Republican likes that idea. Some do.” Top officials hope these moves will help rehabilitate Trump as he comes under assault for his faltering approach to the novel coronavirus over the past two months — with troubles continuing to this date. The U.S. still does not have enough testing kits to know the full range of Americans potentially infected by the coronavirus. The pandemic has spread to all 50 states, and the lack of confidence in the administration’s efforts, combined with the shutdown of businesses, schools and restaurants, has triggered steep declines in the stock market — which Trump has always viewed as a key form of polling for his presidency. The administration’s goal this week includes pushing through Congress another economic stimulus package that is likely to top $1.3 trillion, the centerpiece of which will be checks sent directly to thousands of Americans. In recent days, President Donald Trump has latched onto the idea of the checks as a way to quickly give Americans money to cover housing payments, food and expenses as much of America’s social and business life shuts down as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.  Behind the scenes, the Treasury Department is working on the mechanics of giving Americans direct checks, with the amount depending on one’s income and family size. The administration has considered sending anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per check and has proposed Congress spend a total of $500 billion on the measure, with the IRS issuing the first of two rounds of payments starting April 6, according to the Treasury proposal obtained by POLITICO. “We are looking at different numbers. We are looking at timing that would be different,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. “Splitting the time, splitting the payments. We are looking at a lot of different things. It hasn't been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined. But people want to go big. Everybody seems to want to go big.” The direct payments have received a much better reception on Capitol Hill than the president’s earlier proposal to cut or suspend the payroll tax, a move that would have helped both employees and employers.  One senior administration official said top economic aides presented the president with a list of possible options this week to help Americans financially, and he liked the check idea because it’s an easily understood concept and the money goes out quickly, a second senior administration official said. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also outlined the check proposal earlier this week and then spoke with Trump about it on Wednesday, a person familiar with the conversation said.  Other Republican lawmakers seem equally amenable to it. “It’s a novel idea, and if it will help a lot of people help the economy because we’re in challenging times right now,” said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), one of the lawmakers involved in brainstorming ways to financially help out airlines as part of the broad rescue package. “It’s a lot of money, but the idea is to put cash in people’s hands [to] mitigate the economic effects.” I want to see who is going to receive the money. Is it everyone? Is it someone who is laid off? Is it someone who is quarantined? I just need to see the final details,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. “That’s more of a demand-side remedy. I think to solve this problem we're going to need both demand and supply.“ Senior administration officials caution the idea of a payroll tax cut could still reappear in the coming weeks, with one official noting it still remains under consideration within the administration. Trump’s top economic aides are also weighing which industries will receive government help in the form of loans. The Treasury proposal earmarked $150 billion for industries slammed by the coronavirus downturn, money that would fund loans or loan guarantees.  An additional $50 billion in loans would support the airlines. The Trump administration supports limits on raising executive compensation and reducing service, but Democrats are pushing for stricter provisions.  But the Treasury proposal does not specify which industries could access that $150 billion pool of money. That uncertainty has set off a fierce lobbying effort among hotels, cruise ships, the tourism industry and retailers, all of whom have been in close touch with the White House about the sudden and sharp declines in their businesses. The lobbying is intense because the Senate wants to negotiate this third coronavirus rescue package by the end of the week — putting one of the largest stimulus packages in modern history on an incredibly tight time frame.",Trump adopts the greatest hits of the 2020 Dems,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-economy-coronavirus-democrats-136462,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country, or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack, but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he issued a national emergency declaration to help combat the global pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president,” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the deadly outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command-and-control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy ships with operating rooms and hospital beds to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist local medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to reposition the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a “green light” for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been internal disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the current economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely since the Comfort is currently undergoing maintenance that could take weeks to complete. (The Mercy, which is currently stationed in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with local police units to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated national guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to try to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date, and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, personal friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is specifically trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Ultimately, Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing that “there is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said “tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak…,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the deadly respiratory syndrome. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the Speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander-in-chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump’s machine quickly transforms for ‘a wartime president’ ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"Government officials promise that the closing of the U.S.-Canada border to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus won’t affect trade between the two partners, but a slowdown may be inevitable as the two countries work out what business purposes should be deemed “essential.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that deliveries of food, fuel and medicines would continue under the agreement. But for a binational relationship with tight cultural and commercial ties, many specifics remained unanswered. “They’ve focused on supply chains, which is good, they’ve focused on the crew of an airplane, the driver of a truck … but what they need to focus on and what we need more guidance on right away is essential commercial travel,” said Maryscott Greenwood, a former diplomat who now heads the Canadian-American Business Council. “What is that, who qualifies, how will you decide and, if there is a disagreement, how do you resolve it?” Greenwood said one example is specialized utility company employees from Canada who may need to cross to work on plants or equipment in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is still working out the details with Canadian counterparts Wednesday after both countries’ leaders announced the contours of the deal. Greenwood warned that an “ad hoc” system “would create chaos at the border.” “It would be counterproductive and counterintuitive and an incredibly bad idea to restrict essential commercial travel in a way that harms the economy,” she said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Wednesday evening that it will close its enrollment centers for Trusted Traveler programs beginning Thursday until ""at least"" May 1 to limit employees' and the public's exposure to the virus. That could make it more difficult for any worker who is considered ""essential"" but whose membership in expedited entry lanes has lapsed to cross the border. The overarching economic worries won't be helped by the border restrictions. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, global trade volumes plunged sharply as consumer demand and business activity dried up, as is currently happening because of coronavirus fears. Two-way U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico also took a hit during the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. exports to its northern neighbor dropped by 21 percent and imports from that country fell by one-third. U.S. exports to Mexico fell nearly 15 percent and imports from below the border fell 18 percent. It took two years for overall U.S. exports to return to pre-crisis levels and three years for imports to fully bounce back. The U.S.-Canada goods trade last year was $612 billion, or about 15 percent of total U.S. trade, according to U.S. Census data. Oil and vehicles and their parts were among the biggest U.S. imports in 2019, while cars, trucks and auto parts were among the top exports to Canada. Trump administration officials say they expect a quick recovery once the coronavirus passes and companies resume full operations and consumers begin spending freely again. Some economists caution that the return to normalcy could be hard to predict. ""In 2008-09, there was a lot of bad debt that needed to be purged of the system. It took several years for the rebound to begin to take hold,"" said Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies. ""It’s unclear how quickly economies will rebound from the pandemic. We are in the process of putting the economy into an induced coma and it’s anyone’s guess how the patient will react once it’s reawakened."" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the coming restrictions “will in no way impede the essential trade happening” across the border, without delving into how that will be defined. “We understand on both sides of the border,” she said. “The last thing the Canadian or U.S. economies need right now is another blow.” DHS did not respond to a request for comment on the forthcoming joint statement, though people who work on cross-border relations said they expect it later Wednesday. Freeland indicated that the restrictions would go into effect within hours or days. The announcement marks the most dramatic limits to the shared land border since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when all ports of entry were shuttered for days. “If there’s anything to learn from 9/11, it’s that decisions governing the management of the border need to be made jointly and that there needs to be absolute clarity about what those decisions mean in terms of facilitating the movement of everyday travelers, workers and goods between the two countries,” said Mark Fisher, president and CEO of the Council of the Great Lakes Region. Daniel Ujczo, an international trade lawyer at Dickinson Wright, said the two countries’ stewardship of the border has drastically changed in the decades since, with greater investments in screening technologies and human resources and border agencies that frequently talk to each other. Plus, he said, the threat this time is known, unlike the days immediately following Sept. 11 when more attacks were feared. Trusted trade programs borne out of that time — FAST, Partners in Protection and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism — also offer a starting point for security officials to determine which businesses should have priority to cross, Ujczo said. “It’s a different reality,” he said. Still, Fisher suggested that some trade flows, like the food and medical supplies already highlighted by Trudeau, may need to be prioritized over others while keeping watch on the economic impacts of the tightened border. “I think certain judgments are going to have to be made,” he said.

"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Biden aides say they are clear-eyed about their financial deficit. But on balance, they're grateful: Every day that passes without a Trump ad onslaught assault amounts to a reprieve. “He’s definitely getting a break,” Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns, said of Biden. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Coronavirus shelves Trump's barrage on Biden,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-biden-coronavirus-136197,politico
"As the globe confronts the coronavirus pandemic, one urgent problem is the shortage of key pieces of equipment, including high-quality masks, test kits and—perhaps most important of all—ventilators. It seems hundreds of thousands of lives might be saved, if only manufacturers could quickly ramp up the production of such equipment, perhaps by a factor of 100 or 1,000, within a few weeks. The United States has done something similar, on a nationwide scale, once before—eight decades ago during the emergency of World War II. At that time, there was a desperate need to radically accelerate the output of items such as ships, tanks and bombers. With decisive government action, including taking a little bit of control from corporations, this effort was hugely successful. Might there be lessons to be learned now, from that history? Here are five takeaways from the World War II industrial mobilization to help inspire creative thinking by business leaders and policymakers today. During World War II, manufacturers of key items were guaranteed that national government agencies would purchase all of their output, even if the equipment ultimately wasn't needed. That was a response to the experience of World War I, during which some contractors had been left holding unwanted goods when the conflict ended suddenly in November 1918. During World War II, the technique of guaranteed sales was used to good effect in the machine tools industry. This was the essential sector that supplied the drills, lathes, grinders and other equipment that all sorts of manufacturers needed to turn pieces of metal into finished products. To encourage maximum production of machine tools, the Tools Division of the War Production Board, an emergency civilian coordinating agency, created what it called the pool-order mechanism, guaranteeing purchases of maximum output. As the official history of the Tools Division put it soon after the war, this device “encouraged output at a rate manufacturers could not have afforded otherwise.” The lesson for 2020 is that if we want more ventilators as soon as possible, the national government needs to guarantee it will purchase them. During World War II, expert manufacturers shared designs and techniques with other firms, so that key items could be produced on multiple production lines, simultaneously. This was done on a grand scale in the U.S. aircraft industry. For example, Pratt & Whitney, the top aircraft engine manufacturer, shared drawings and knowledge with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors, the giant automakers, so that they could mass-produce engines, under licensing agreements with nominal fees. Similarly, Boeing worked with competitors, including Lockheed and Vega, so the Boeing-designed B-17 bomber could be made at its rivals’ plants in California, as well as in the company’s home facility in Seattle. These arrangements were encouraged and facilitated by the U.S. Army Air Forces, which, like other military organizations, served as a top manager and coordinator of the war economy. Today, public authorities and business leaders might use a similar approach, by arranging to have the best versions of key items like tests, ventilators, medications and vaccines made by multiple companies, using temporary deals that would bypass delays that might come from concerns about proprietary technology and competitive advantage. World War II saw the emergency construction of manufacturing plants, the vast majority of which were paid for and owned by U.S. government agencies but operated by companies in the private sector. Indeed, the main mechanism for the biggest expansions of industrial capacity in World War II was the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) plant. The famed Kaiser shipyards, which turned out big merchant vessels in a matter of days, were GOCO facilities, as were most of the big new bomber plants run by the top airframe manufacturers, including Douglas, Martin and North American. The atomic bomb project, like the conventional explosives program, was based on GOCO plants, run by some of the country’s leading corporate manufacturers, including DuPont and Eastman Kodak. By eliminating risk to private producers and their bankers, this model of government financing and ownership proved much more effective than other schemes used during World War II, including tax incentives and government promises to buy privately financed plants over a five-year period. Today, the GOCO model could be useful in cases where new production lines—for respirators, vaccines or other items we realize are now essential—need to be built fast, without waiting to see whether private capital will fund them. The record of World War II shows it is possible, if not easy, to produce emergency alternatives closer to home when global supply chains are disrupted. Many of the combatant nations in World War II did this more than the United States, which was fortunate to have vast natural resources and the world’s largest national economy. But even the U.S. was forced into an all-out emergency scramble to replace imports with new domestic sources, most importantly in the case of rubber. Here American authorities failed to anticipate an enormous problem for the war effort that occurred when Japan’s victories in early 1942 cut off imports of natural rubber from Indonesia. This threatened to cripple the production of items like military trucks and aircraft, which needed rubber for their tires. However, a massive, rapid effort, using GOCO plants and the expertise of oil, chemical and tire companies, allowed the United States to rapidly build from scratch a big new synthetic rubber industry. Today, as the disruption of global supply chains is making it harder to procure a variety of key components for the coronavirus fight, it makes sense for policymakers and business leaders to engage in some quick planning and cooperation, to find and finance domestic substitutes. U.S. authorities successfully contained the problem of profiteering—and, perhaps more important, the problem of public outrage at perceived illegitimate profit-taking in time of crisis—with a multidimensional array of controls. These included direct caps on prices, special war taxes and very high marginal income tax rates on war manufacturers, and congressionally mandated “renegotiation” (clawbacks) of corporate profits deemed by the War and Navy Departments to be excessive. These measures did not prevent all profiteering, nor public complaints about it, but they did improve on the record of World War I. The high taxes paid for nearly half of the war effort (with most of the rest financed by war bonds), keeping deficits in check. Thanks in part to the price and profit controls, public morale—and the legitimacy of private- and public-sector authorities—remained high enough for Americans to sustain an energetic, multiyear mobilization. In 2020, targeted taxes and controls could similarly limit hoarding and profiteering, boosting public morale. And if emergency stimulus measures are so big as to trigger inflation, sharply progressive taxes could be an equitable way to tame a rise in prices, while holding down deficits. To be sure, none of these techniques from 80 years ago might be perfectly applicable to our situation in 2020. Perhaps most important, it is likely that the current mobilization needs to go even faster. During World War II, the giant war plants used to ramp up production took months to build. Today, it would appear that we have not months, but weeks. A quicker mobilization would likely test the limits of some of the technologies that have developed over the past decades, including quick modular construction, computer modeling, 3-D printing and robotics. Nonetheless, despite the different timetable, some of the techniques outlined above, including various forms of public assumption of risk, might remain relevant for today’s policymakers. Of course, today’s crisis makes it clear that there has been systematic underinvestment, over the past several decades, in planning, in-house government labs and plants, surge capacity and public health. One reason for this is that American leaders failed to learn properly from the record of World War II. That failure came not only from forgetfulness or oversight, but also from a deliberate effort to obscure the importance of public investment, public regulation and public coordination by those who preferred a story of World War II in which the only heroes on the homefront were for-profit companies. Today, we need to relearn the real lessons from that war. By using new, creative solutions inspired by a fuller understanding of the real history, we will be better armed to combat the biggest challenges of the 21st century.",The 5 WWII Lessons That Could Help the Government Fight Coronavirus,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/coronavirus-defense-production-world-war-two-lessons-135814,politico

"OTTAWA — Across Canada, provincial health authorities have limited access to coronavirus tests to conserve resources, even as the World Health Organization calls on nations to expand testing to slow the spread of the disease. Several provinces, including Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, are instructing people with mild symptoms of Covid-19 to self-isolate rather than seek testing, partly to guard against shortages. But on Wednesday, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to ""isolate, test, treat and trace."" “If they don’t, transmission chains can continue at a low level, then resurge once physical distancing measures are lifted,"" he told reporters. In Ottawa on Wednesday, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam once again stressed the need to flatten the curve of the virus' spread, pointing to a ""sharp rise in cases"" during the past week. ""This is a signal there is some degree of community spread,"" she said. ""Our time to act is now."" As of Wednesday evening, Canada had recorded nearly 730 confirmed and presumptive cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, including a first death reported in Quebec earlier that day. Though the numbers are clearly increasing, health experts say it’s hard to know how many cases there actually are in Canada, since not everyone with symptoms is being tested. But they disagree about how much the real numbers matter. Some point out that the available data shows the rate of spread, if not the total number of people infected, and say as long as people with symptoms self-isolate, Canada has a chance to slow transmission of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Others counter that people are less likely to self-isolate if they don’t know whether they have Covid-19, and argue it’s much harder to control the virus when you don’t know exactly where it is. David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said testing is the best way to get control of an epidemic early. By the time people start to die, he said, there have likely been generations of transmission that have gone undetected. “And that’s how you get completely hosed by this,” he said. “The testing is kind of our eyes and ears in terms of what’s happening. … I think we’re missing a ton of this stuff.” Fisman said the real number of cases in Canada could be much larger than the number on the books. “We have the sense that our positives are increasing exponentially,” he said. “The question is what fraction of the true total cases does that represent.” Moreover, the cases being confirmed today are likely people who got sick a week ago or more, said University of Toronto epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Kwong. “In an ideal world, we would be testing everybody,” he said. “It’s just the reality is we don’t have the resources to do that.” Ottawa’s medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, has warned there could be hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the city, though there is still no proof of community transmission. Fisman said that may well be the case in many Canadian cities. Even if the confirmed cases are a significant underestimate, though, they still give a sense of the virus’ trajectory, said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre. “I think that as long as we keep doing the same thing … the numbers from one day to the next are telling us something about how the epidemic is growing,” he said. Canada is “actually doing a really good job” at testing, given limited resources, said Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses. “I don’t think the overall accuracy of the definitive numbers is really important at this stage,” he said, pointing instead to the importance of social distancing and self-isolation to flatten the curve of the virus' spread. Still, Dr. William Cherniak, an emergency room physician who has been testing patients for Covid-19 for about a month, said the ideal solution would be a test that people could administer themselves. “My thing is always that knowledge is power,” he said. Self-isolation would be effective “if people really stayed at home for 14 days if they had the symptoms,” he said. But if they haven’t been diagnosed with Covid-19, he believes, they’re less likely to take those instructions seriously.  On Wednesday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced Canada has approved two new diagnostic tests to allow provincial labs to expand testing. “Early diagnosis is a critical component of slowing down the spread of the illness and Canadians can be encouraged that Canada has been leading in terms of our testing capacity,” she said. Certainly, Canada has been doing more testing than the U.S., relative to population size. Tam said Wednesday that more than 50,000 people have been tested for Covid-19 in Canada. Meanwhile, the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run accounting of every coronavirus test administered in the U.S., was reporting a total of about 76,000 tests on Wednesday evening, for a population 10 times the size of Canada's. Still, Canada’s efforts don’t compare to the work being done in South Korea, which now has the ability to test up to 20,000 people a day. What many Canadians are watching for these days is whether this country is on the same trajectory as Italy was a few weeks ago, before its hospitals were flooded with patients needing emergency care. If Canada has any chance of avoiding that, Kindrachuk said, now is the time to take social distancing seriously, regardless of the exact number of cases. “It’s the calm before the storm in a lot of ways. We cannot become complacent,” he said. “If we don’t do anything different, we know where this is going.”","Canada has tested more than 50,000 people for Covid-19.

"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  George echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed to this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country, or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack, but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he issued a national emergency declaration to help combat the global pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president,” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the deadly outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command-and-control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy ships with operating rooms and hospital beds to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist local medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to reposition the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a “green light” for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been internal disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the current economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely since the Comfort is currently undergoing maintenance that could take weeks to complete. (The Mercy, which is currently stationed in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with local police units to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated national guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to try to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date, and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, personal friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is specifically trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Ultimately, Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing that “there is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said “tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak…,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the deadly respiratory syndrome. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the Speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander-in-chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “My beautiful fiancee and I will be celebrating at home, following the White House and CDC’s guidelines.

Todd Rokita (R-Ind.). I was fresh out of college, had no ties to Indiana, no connections in Republican politics and no clue what I was doing.

"Probably for most of us, the coronavirus crisis will soon enough—Six months? A year?—recede in our minds and come to seem like a hallucinatory moment. Maybe it will be like a hurricane that forced everyone to rush inland and then only glanced the coast.  Or maybe it will be like a hurricane that really does hit. Even then, human nature being what it is, most people will clean up and move on. Yet no matter how the coronavirus pandemic passes, or how quickly, there is likely in these strange housebound weeks a new political epoch being born. There are two large reasons to believe the political echo of this crisis will last much longer than the crisis itself. The first is that many of the people whose expectations and routines are most dramatically upended by the pandemic are students. The interruption, and in some cases irreplaceable loss, of important experiences in their education, as campuses empty and untold events are canceled, will likely shape their consciousness in more lasting ways than for the rest of us. Like most catastrophes, the pandemic’s malign consequences will fall most heavily on the underprivileged. Unlike most catastrophes, its costs are also being paid heavily by some segments of the most privileged. Those college seniors whose spring terms and graduation ceremonies are suddenly deleted include many people who are future leaders of the public and private sectors. No, it’s not the end of the world for them. But it’s a piercing loss even so—one being paid more for the benefit of older, less healthy people than for pure self-protection. More profoundly, the dynamics of the coronavirus moment likely will resemble the dynamics of other great public policy issues shadowing the next generation. In particular, the global pandemic and the harsh choices it imposes offer—in highly concentrated fashion in coming months—much the same choices that responses to global climate change will impose in coming decades. Like the coronavirus emergency, climate change is a problem whose dimensions are largely the province of scientific experts—employing complex data models aimed at illuminating future trends that the average citizen can understand in broad concept but not in detail. The essential question: Do you trust these experts, or not? Like the coronavirus, climate change is a problem for which remedies are not solely the province of experts but are primarily the realm of community values. These remedies involve tangible and immediate costs for benefits that are abstract and imponderable.  In the case of coronavirus, for instance, the shutdown of the economy required by enforcing social distancing imposes costs that are immediate and quite likely already in your midst—layoffs of someone you know, uncertainty about future income, concern for a favorite neighborhood business about to go under. As to the benefits, meanwhile, no one knows—certainly not now, maybe not ever. Perhaps the massive response won’t really be effective and a public health catastrophe unfolds anyway. Or maybe the response in retrospect will seem overblown. In the case of climate change, the tension between immediate certain consequences—whether paying a carbon tax or substantially altering consumption habits—for diffuse and distant benefits is more acute. The rewards for the deep and comprehensive changes needed to replace a carbon-fueled economy and halt the warming of the planet will be enjoyed—one hopes—primarily by people not yet born. Finally, of course, coronavirus is like climate change in the sense that it is impervious to national borders. One way to gauge the power of these currents—crisis fueled by frightening science—is by watching the change in President Donald Trump. There is no way to know for certain what the coronavirus means for his reelection. But already it is evident what it has meant for Trumpism. It has sent it hurtling into retreat. Trumpism as an idea is about promoting and protecting American sovereignty and singularity. In some contexts, even Trump foes might agree it’s an attractive concept: Well might we wish to seal our borders from the virus. But the only way this would be effective would be if the United States had years ago opted to adjourn from the modern interconnected global economy. Yes, the coronavirus first presented itself in China. How many people were surprised to learn only in the past few weeks that nearly all U.S. antibiotics also come from China. Trumpism as a style is defined not just by boasting and bluster; his triumphalism depends on projecting certitude. The president early on acted as if he could indeed create reality by proclamation, when he assured the public that U.S. infections would soon be down to zero. Only in recent days, as the possibility of widespread domestic disease mounts, has Trump acknowledged imprecision—the fragmentary nature of our understanding of how far the virus has spread, how effective efforts to blunt its impact will be, or when these efforts will be deemed sufficient.  One way to appreciate the murkiness of our circumstances—and the moral implications of this murkiness—is to view them through the eyes of young people. No need to overstate things. Missing spring semester is not the same as dodging sniper fire in Kabul, nor the same as being laid off from your job handling bags at O’Hare.  But nor should one understate things. Suppose baseball has been your consuming passion since age 6 and now at 22 you are expecting one last idyll as team captain. Now that season will never happen. Maybe you were planning to spend the semester in Peru and are now scrambling to see if you can find a flight home. Planes and restaurants will fill up again. In all likelihood that semester abroad is gone for good. Psych 101 perhaps can be taken remotely; the exhilarating 1 a.m. conversation in the dorm lounge will not be.  Out of curiosity, I read various college and university presidents’ letters announcing the closure of their campuses. Most were filled with the same kind of bromides as your workplace or mine offered about caring first and foremost for the health and etc., etc., of our community. One letter, by Williams College president Maud Mandel, stuck out for its candor: “A healthy person could reasonably choose to stay and accept the personal risk of catching COVID-19, but the decision would unacceptably increase the chance of contagion for others.” Indeed, that 21-year-old might plausibly calculate, even if he or she gets sick the chances are, not for everybody but for most, that it would be a miserable few days rather than life-threatening illness. Those institutions closed less to protect their campus communities than to protect the broader society. The coronavirus pandemic does not remotely have the cataclysmic shock and violence of 9/11. For many people, however, the virus’ actual day-in, day-out impact will be more pervasive. 9-11 was followed by a period, which turned out to be short-lived, of national connection and goodwill. Trump, who has made mockery and castigation of opponents his signature, surely did not conjure fuzzy feelings from many quarters with his appeal at the White House on Wednesday that, “We are all in this together.” Yet the pandemic has a logic that transcends politics and personal feeling. Never mind how one feels about Trump. Never mind how we feel about one another. The reality of a dangerous virus is that we are all in this together.

"Coronavirus has finally reached Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a ninth-term Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, a freshman Democrat from Utah, revealed on Wednesday that they had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first U.S. lawmakers to contract the virus that‘s spreading across the country. Diaz-Balart, 58, said he began to develop symptoms on Saturday, just hours after he left the House floor for a vote on a coronavirus response bill. More than 400 members of Congress also voted during the early-Saturday session. Diaz-Balart’s statement indicates he decided to “self-quarantine in Washington D.C.” after the vote. His statement doesn’t indicate why he believed he needed to self-quarantine before developing symptoms or whether he informed staff or other members of Congress that he might have exposed them to the illness. “I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” Diaz-Balart said in the statement. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.” McAdams, 45, also said his symptoms began mildly on Saturday night, after he had returned to Utah. He immediately began self-quarantining on the advice of his doctor. “My symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough and labored breathing and I remained self-quarantined,“ McAdams said in a statement. “On Tuesday, my doctor instructed me to get tested for COVID-19 and following his referral, I went to the local testing clinic for the test. Today I learned that I tested positive.“ Diaz-Balart said he decided to remain in Washington on Saturday because he was concerned about being in his South Florida home, where his wife, who has a pre-existing condition, would be “at exceptionally high risk.” Like Diaz-Balart, McAdams didn‘t indicate whether he had urged any of his colleagues or aides to self-quarantine. The news of two members testing positive has already begun rippling across Congress. Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.) said on Wednesday night that the House doctor had advised him to self-quarantine until March 27 because he “was in contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19.“ The House minority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), said on Wednesday that he, too, would self-quarantine because he had held an “extended meeting“ with Diaz-Balart late last week. Scalise is now the highest-ranking lawmaker to self-quarantine amid the outbreak. Overnight, four more lawmakers announced self-quarantines. Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) told the Miami Herald that she would isolate herself and that another member of the Florida delegation was being tested based on symptoms. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) also announces self-quarantines.  Though Diaz-Balart and McAdams are the first in Congress to develop coronavirus, the illness has struck among a small number of congressional aides. It’s sure to heighten already-acute fears on Capitol Hill that members themselves, particularly the high proportion of elderly lawmakers, are vulnerable when they meet in Washington. The development appears likely to revive an internal House debate about whether to permit remote voting for lawmakers amid a pandemic that‘s ravaging the country, pummeling the economy and limiting members‘ ability to travel across the country.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have resisted the idea, worrying that it would set a damaging precedent for the future and signal a lack of confidence from government in the country‘s fight against coronavirus. But with two lawmakers ill and untold others exposed, some lawmakers say it‘s time to think again. “In. Person. Voting. Should. Be. Reconsidered,“ Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a freshman Democrat from Florida, said in a tweet late Wednesday. “For the safety of our communities, during this emergency, we must be able to legislate from our districts.“ Earlier in the day, 50 lawmakers of both parties wrote to House leaders asking them to reconsider remote voting as well, arguing that Congress must hold itself to the same standards it‘s asking of other Americans.",First 2 members of Congress test positive for coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/first-member-of-congress-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-136300,politico
"The Labor Department reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a 70,000 jump over the previous week that it attributed to the coronavirus epidemic. It was the highest level of claims since September 2017 and the first in a flood of unfavorable economic indicators expected from the Trump administration as businesses shut down and workers go home. Unemployment claims will likely rise higher in coming months as job growth ends, the unemployment rate rises, and GDP sags. The only question is how long the bad times will last, and that will depend on how fast and how far the virus spreads. DOL's new unemployment number records claims filed during the week ending March 14. But reports from unemployment insurance offices around the country indicated the real explosion in claims began this past weekend, and continued unabated this week. In Colorado, nearly 11,000 unemployment claims were filed Monday and Tuesday, compared to only 400 claims filed the previous Monday. In New Jersey, 15,000 people applied for unemployment benefits on Monday, a number twelve times higher than normal levels. Pennsylvania was on track to see more than 100,000 claims on Monday and Tuesday, compared to 12,000 during first week of March. And in the 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places, workers filed nearly ten times as many claims as during the entire week one year earlier. Jacob Robbins, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who tracks unemployment insurance claims, estimated that in 14 states roughly 340,000 claims were made on March 16 and March 17 alone — more than fifty percent more than were reported nationwide during the previous week. The surge in unemployment claims accompanied widespread reports of layoffs nationwide. New York-based Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, laid off 80 percent of its workers. On Tuesday Marriott said it expects to lay off tens of thousands of workers worldwide. MGM Resorts International closed 150 restaurants and bars Monday. Experts predicted millions of job losses. The Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 3000 jobs have been lost already, and that job losses could rise as high as 9 million. The Senate on Wednesday passed a multibillion dollar emergency aid package to counter the economic slowdown that included $2 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Senate Republicans are also working on a proposal for a third, larger stimulus package to address the epidemic that likely will include $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. Earlier this month DOL advised states that workers affected by the coronavirus are eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. The agency said that states would be permitted to pay benefits to individuals quarantined with the expectation of returning to work, and to those who leave employment to avoid exposure to coronavirus or to care for a sick family member. But it's not clear how well, even with the additional $2 billion in federal assistance, the state unemployment system will cushion the blow. Some state unemployment insurance programs have reduced the number of weeks workers can receive benefits since the last economic downturn in 2007-09. In addition, 22 states and jurisdictions, including California, New York, Illinois and Texas, are also facing dangerously low reserves.",Coronavirus drives up unemployment claims ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-drives-up-unemployment-claims-137067,politico

"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened fewer than one million travelers on March 17 — making it the slowest day at airports since the so-called “Snowpocalypse“ in 2011.  According to new data from the TSA, the agency screened 983,226 on Tuesday. That was the fewest daily travelers going through TSA checkpoints since Feb. 1, 2011, when a massive blizzard snarled air traffic across North America. Before Snowpocalypse, the last day when TSA officers screened fewer than a million travelers was May 30, 2004, per the agency’s numbers.  As the U.S. has closed its borders to much of Europe and public health officials have warned people against taking unnecessary flights, year-to-day traveler numbers have plummeted. On March 14, a million fewer people passed through TSA checkpoints than did on the same Saturday in 2019.  TSA officials are at the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The agency has revealed that at least eight of its employees have contracted the virus, which has sickened at least thirteen total Department of Homeland Security officials, per documents POLITICO reviewed. And two sources with knowledge of the situation also said that two contractors from the department’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office have tested positive for the virus. That office plays a role in airport screenings designed to slow the virus’s spread.  The aviation industry has taken a body blow since the coronavirus has spread. The American airline industry’s trade group put out a statement March 16 saying airlines were seeing “a dramatic decline in demand, which is getting worse by the day.” The industry implored the federal government to give it loans, grants, and tax relief, saying the economic situation is “simply not sustainable.” The industry group has sought tens of billions in help from Washington, per CNN.  President Donald Trump said on March 18 that the industry can expect some sort of bailout.  “Airlines would be No. 1,” he said, per USA Today. “You go from having the best year they have ever had to having no passengers because of what we have had to do to win this war — and it’s a war.”  But any bailout will raise tricky political questions — especially since Trump himself lambasted the Obama administration’s auto industry rescue. And Congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have telegraphed that they see any aid package as a chance to call for worker protections and differentiate themselves from Republicans going into the 2020 campaign, as The Washington Post has detailed.  Another complicating factor: According to a Bloomberg report, America’s biggest airlines spent the vast majority of their free cash flow over the last 10 years buying back their own stock. Schumer said on the Senate floor that the companies instead should have saved that money “for a rainy day.”",Airport screenings dip below 1 million per day,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/airport-screenings-dip-below-1-million-per-day-136840,politico

"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Biden aides say they are clear-eyed about their financial deficit. But on balance, they're grateful: Every day that passes without a Trump ad onslaught assault amounts to a reprieve. “He’s definitely getting a break,” Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns, said of Biden. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Trump wanted to bury Biden after the primary.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged Thursday the U.S. faces months of economic contraction, but predicted a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent up demand” and return to “a normal world.”  In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he believes the economy will see its largest decline in this year’s second quarter, from April through June, followed by a third-quarter recovery as advancements in viral treatments and vaccines eventually halt the spread of the virus.  ""I think you’re going to see a lot of pent-up demand,"" Mnuchin told Bartiromo. ""When we get through the next few months and Americans see what’s happening, and we have killed this virus, people are going to be comfortable going back to work.""  Mnuchin continued: ""We're going to be opening back business and people are going to continue what they do. They are going to live. They are going to shop. They are going to eat out. They are going to enjoy restaurants and travel and entertainment and we will go back to a normal world.”  Bartiromo pressed Mnuchin on company bailouts — a term he continues to push against. He emphasized Thursday that many of these companies will ultimately pay back any loans.  “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need.""  ""In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans. In the case of small businesses, if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them,"" he continued. ""I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.”  Mnuchin also clarified his reported warning to Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could spike to 20 percent if action is not taken. “What I said is that 40 percent of our workforce is in small business,"" he explained. ""And I said, if half of them were let go, mathematically, we’d be at 20 percent unemployment.”  Mnuchin’s upbeat outlook comes alongside grim new data emerging from the federal government. The Labor Department on Thursday reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week, a jump it attributed to the pandemic. It was the highest number of claims since September 2017, and economists expect that figure to soar in the coming weeks. Asked if economic data should be ignored in this volatile environment, Mnuchin replied, “The statistics in the short run of economics are obviously not relevant.

"A decade of sharp cuts to state unemployment programs threatens to leave laid-off workers more vulnerable than during the Great Recession. With 10 states having reduced since the 2007-09 recession the maximum weeks employees can receive unemployment benefits, many state unemployment systems will be less generous to the unemployed than they were during that earlier downturn — even with the $1 billion boost that unemployment insurance is set to receive in the legislative package before Congress. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, recipients can stop receiving unemployment benefits after 12 weeks, despite predictions from public health officials and economic experts that the economic aftereffects from the coronavirus pandemic could last much longer. Meanwhile, nearly half of U.S. states and jurisdictions are running dangerously low on unemployment cash, further limiting the amount of stimulus they can deliver to weather the economic fallout. “Unemployment insurance is about more than just giving somebody a check when they’re unemployed,"" said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. ""It’s a macroeconomic stabilizer.” The generosity of unemployment benefits varies greatly among states. Unemployed workers in South Carolina and Missouri may receive $1,500 less and $1,400 less, respectively, than they would have heading into the Great Recession, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report. Workers in Kansas could receive $2,000 less, and workers in North Carolina could lose $2,700. Congress’ coronavirus response package would offer states some relief but do little to expand benefits, which are set at the state level. The House-passed bill would give $500 million to help states process the expected surge in unemployment claims, and another $500 million in administrative assistance grants to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment. This second $500 million is conditioned on states waiving work-search requirements, waiting periods and penalties for employers that lay off workers. But it isn't conditioned on states extending benefits for any particular length of time. Federal assistance to state unemployment systems accounts by law for half the number of weeks that states already offer. Consequently, the states that cover the fewest number of weeks would receive the least help from any increase. For example, a state that offers 20 weeks' unemployment benefits would get 10 extra weeks' federal funding, while a state that offers 26 weeks would get 13. “That is a further consequence of the cutbacks that have taken place in a number of states — it also cuts back on the amount of extra weeks you get in a recession,” said Chad Stone, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. After the Great Recession, businesses lobbied, often successfully, to limit state taxes to increase state reserves for unemployment insurance, which the recession had depleted. Many states did so by cutting benefits for recipients. An individual employer’s payment rate for state unemployment insurance is typically tied to how many workers the employer lays off, much like a motorist who sees his or her insurance go up after an accident. Cutting benefits was a way to replenish the trust fund while limiting tax increases on business. “At some point, it gets to be a level where employers come to policymakers and say, ‘Hey, this is crazy. I want to hire people but I can’t afford to, because the payroll tax I would have for that is so high,’” said Matt Weidinger, a researcher at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package denied unemployment assistance to states that cut benefits. But according to Weidinger, states found a loophole: They could receive the assistance if they maintained the same level of benefits but cut the number of weeks these benefits could be received. On the whole, experts agree that state trust funds are in better shape than before the last recession. An AEI report that Weidinger published this month shows aggregate state trust fund balances at 76 billion, 40 percent higher than in 2007. The majority of states maintain sufficient unemployment insurance reserves to weather a recession, according to Labor Department data. But there remain 22 states and jurisdictions — including populous states like California, New York, Texas and Illinois — that have dangerously low reserves. As the crisis worsens, states are beginning to act on their own. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday that even before Congress compels him to, he will waive his state’s one-week waiting period and suspend work-search requirements for recipients, in part to help workers suffering from a state closure of bars and restaurants. On Monday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expanded unemployment benefits from 20 to 26 weeks and said that it will cover those taking care of family members. “We’re very mindful of the economic hurt for individuals who will lose their jobs,” DeWine said Sunday. “Look, this is brutally tough. And my heart goes out to them. But we have to do what we have to do to save their lives.”",Many states are ill-prepared for unemployment benefits surge,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/many-states-are-ill-prepared-for-unemployment-benefits-surge-137371,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday morning, State issued a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information.  It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later.  ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.”  “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said.  Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens.Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday that she would end her presidential campaign, formally winnowing the 2020 Democratic field to a two-man race between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. ""Today, I'm suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to Vice President Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,"" Gabbard said in a video statement posted online. In endorsing Biden, Gabbard said that ""although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he's motivated by his love for our country and the American people."" ""I'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha, respect and compassion, and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart,"" she added. Gabbard closely tied the reasons for her withdrawal from the race to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying that ""the best way that I can be of service at this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and to stand ready to serve in uniform should the Hawaii National Guard be activated.""  Gabbard previously served two tours in the Middle East with the Hawaii Army National Guard — in Iraq from 2004-2005 and in Kuwait from 2008-2009 — and stepped away from her campaign in August to report for active duty, participating in a two-week joint training exercise in Indonesia. Apart from Biden and Sanders, Gabbard outlasted all of her Democratic rivals to become the third remaining White House hopeful in what began as a historically diverse and crowded pack of candidates.  The Hawaii lawmaker faced significant criticism for her seemingly quixotic decision to stay in the race beyond the early nominating contests, and now finishes her campaign with only two pledged delegates — less than several of her former rivals who dropped out weeks ago. But Gabbard, long a controversial figure within the Democratic field, had little to lose after declaring in October that she would not seek reelection to a fifth term in Congress, a prospect complicated by a formidable primary challenger and thorny relationships with other Hawaii politicians. She had also become the subject of widespread skepticism among national Democrats, often rebuked for her past anti-LGBT rhetoric, isolationist brand of diplomacy and 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom she declined to label a war criminal despite the dictator's use of chemical weapons to attack his own people. Gabbard typically polled better with independents than self-identified Democrats, and acquired some support from fringe conservatives. She was frequently referenced in Russian media and propaganda, prompting a high-profile clash with Hillary Clinton after the 2016 Democratic nominee claimed the congresswoman was the ""favorite"" of Moscow. Although Gabbard's last appearance in a primary debate was in November, before the Democratic National Committee raised its bar participate, she emerged as a fiery on-stage presence — blasting other candidates for their records and proposals on foreign policy, criminal justice and the impeachment of President Donald Trump, among other issues.  Her exit from the race Thursday after weeks of defying political pressure to drop out reflects the new nature of the Democratic primary, which has become frozen in place amid the COVID-19 outbreak and seen Biden mount a nearly insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders. The senator's campaign manager announced Wednesday he would ""assess"" the state of his White House bid in the days ahead.","Tulsi Gabbard ends White House bid, endorses Biden",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/tulsi-gabbard-ends-white-house-bid-137242,politico
"The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will self-quarantine for a week, after he shook hands with Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart days before the Florida Republican developed coronavirus symptoms, the agency confirmed this morning. Steve Dickson and Diaz-Balart shook hands before an appropriations hearing on March 11. Diaz-Balart has said that he developed a headache and fever the night of March 14. He and Rep.

"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. The highly unusual State Department travel advisory is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, after President Donald Trump first moved to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have moved to close their borders and impose further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday.

"Climate activists are retooling their strategy for an online existence during the coronavirus pandemic. As mass gatherings are canceled around the world to promote ""social distancing,"" a loose coalition of youth-focused activists has been plotting how to stay relevant without the large demonstrations that have become a staple of the climate movement. Organizers are nixing public rallies and looking for new approaches to stay active in the 2020 campaign without an opportunity to confront politicians in public. “We’re an organization of a bunch of millennials and Generation Z so in many ways we grew up online and are well-equipped to meet this moment,” Evan Weber, national political director for Sunrise Movement, told POLITICO. Global Climate Strike, a coalition inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg's Friday school strikes, has suspended the weekly demonstrations that brought thousands of people to the streets in the U.S. and around the world. Thunberg last week encouraged supporters to participate in a ""digital strike"" instead of gathering in public, and coalition members have been on wall-to-wall calls this week to figure how to keep up public pressure on governments to fight climate change. In the U.S., Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Sunrise Movement and other green groups canceled three days of nationwide protests in April coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. The Sunrise Movement has suspended a voter registration drive on college campuses that aimed to sign up 125,000 new voters; the group registered about 1,000 new voters in Iowa but had planned to kick the campaign into high gear after Earth Day, Weber said. Instead it will next week launch “Sunrise School,” a series of online classes to train high school and college students on organizing and campaigning tactics. The group is also drafting a ""list of demands"" outlining how former Vice President Joe Biden can win their votes if he becomes the Democratic nominee. But where Sunrise members have previously been able to get to Biden on the rope line at a campaign event, it will now have to submit those demands electronically. The League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, one of the environmental movement's largest voter registration programs, has taken a hit because it depends ""on face-to-face interactions,"" Hilda Nucete, the fund's deputy director of civic engagement said in a statement. ""While this is a short-term blow to our in-person voter registration goals, we are not slowing our efforts to increase civic participation,"" she said. ""We are exploring an expansion of our existing digital, mail and phone-based strategies to continue voter engagement during this time and compensate for lost face-to-face opportunities."" Zero Hour and National Children's Campaign, two youth-led groups, had to postpone their voter registration bus tour that was to swing through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin beginning Friday. The groups are targeting new dates in July in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention, said Jonah Gottlieb, co-founder and executive director with the National Children's Campaign. In the absence of rallies and door-to-door canvassing, organizers are stepping up online recruitment and organizing phone banks, noting many people are sitting at home yearning for something to do. Katie Eder, executive director of Future Coalition, a youth-centered climate advocacy group, said coalition members are brainstorming ideas this week and intend to announce more detailed plans next week. Activities could include digital town halls with appearances from celebrities and politicians are being planned to replace the sit-ins at banks, marches and concerts planned for Earth Day. Gaming Facebook’s algorithm to increase visibility, such as encouraging supporters to “check in” for a potential multi-day livestreamed Earth Day event — a tactic previously used during protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline — is under consideration, too. None of that can replace in-person action, but it can potentially help keep people engaged, said Jamie Henn, an activist who is coordinating sit-ins at banks to protest fossil fuel investments through a coalition called Stop the Money Pipeline. Focus is required. Tactics need to “go beyond just tweeting a lot.” “There will be a lot of experimentation in the weeks to come to figure out what works and what makes an impact,” he said. “That’s the challenge right now in the progressive movement. What can we do that continues to hit home?” Dana Fisher, a University of Maryland sociology professor who has studied movements for 20 years, said young climate activists may be uniquely well suited to the current moment because they are far less reliant on in-person meetings than activists in earlier generations. “They just all go on Zoom,” she said, referring to the online video conferencing platform. “Why would I leave my house if I don’t have to?” May Boeve, executive director of climate activism group 350.org, said her organization has operated virtually since it sprung out of campus efforts to fight pipeline construction over a decade ago. Her group has put out training materials and other aids to assist with “navigating this new paradigm,” though she admitted having concrete impact for online-only activism “requires a lot of creativity.” “There are people really trying to test the limit of what virtual meetings can do,” she said, noting much of the heavy lifting for events already occurs online. ""The end product of it is people gathering in the streets but there’s a lot that happens in the street. Obviously it’s the last part of that process where people are having to really stretch.”",Climate activists shift gears in an age of 'social distancing',2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/climate-activists-social-distancing-coronavirus-137216,politico

"The Labor Department reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week that it attributed to the coronavirus epidemic. It was the highest level of claims since September 2017 and the first in a flood of unfavorable economic indicators expected from the Trump administration as businesses shut down and workers go home. Unemployment claims will likely rise higher in coming months as job growth ends, the unemployment rate rises, and GDP sags. ""Today’s hurricane-sized increase is nothing compared to what we can expect in coming weeks,"" Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a prepared statement. ""The full weight of this economic shock is still ramping up."" The only question is how long the bad times will last, and that will depend on how fast and how far the virus spreads. According to DOL, layoffs were concentrated in service related industries, as well as in transportation and warehousing. The latest unemployment number covers claims filed during the week ending March 14. But reports from unemployment insurance offices around the country indicated the real explosion in claims began this past weekend, and continued unabated this week. In Colorado, nearly 11,000 unemployment claims were filed Monday and Tuesday, compared to only 400 claims filed the previous Monday. In New Jersey, 15,000 people applied for unemployment benefits on Monday, a number twelve times higher than normal levels. Pennsylvania was on track to see more than 100,000 claims on Monday and Tuesday, compared to 12,000 during first week of March. And in the 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places, workers filed nearly ten times as many claims as during the entire week one year earlier. Jacob Robbins, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who tracks unemployment insurance claims, estimated that in 14 states roughly 340,000 claims were made on March 16 and March 17 alone — more than fifty percent more than were reported nationwide during the previous week. The surge in unemployment claims accompanied widespread reports of layoffs nationwide. New York-based Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, laid off 80 percent of its workers. On Tuesday Marriott said it expects to lay off tens of thousands of workers worldwide. MGM Resorts International closed 150 restaurants and bars Monday. Experts predicted millions of job losses. The Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 3000 jobs have been lost already, and that job losses could rise as high as 9 million. The Senate on Wednesday passed a multibillion dollar emergency aid package to counter the economic slowdown that included $2 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Senate Republicans are also working on a proposal for a third, larger stimulus package to address the epidemic that likely will include $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. Earlier this month DOL advised states that workers affected by the coronavirus are eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. The agency said that states would be permitted to pay benefits to individuals quarantined with the expectation of returning to work, and to those who leave employment to avoid exposure to coronavirus or to care for a sick family member. But it's not clear how well, even with the additional $2 billion in federal assistance, the state unemployment system will cushion the blow. Some state unemployment insurance programs have since the last economic downturn in 2007-reduced the number of weeks workers can receive benefits. In addition, 22 states and jurisdictions, including California, New York, Illinois and Texas, are also facing dangerously low reserves. “Today’s numbers reveal that while Congress considers new strategies to help the unemployed, Americans are turning to a jobless safety net that is unable to meet their needs,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation said in an emailed statement. Policymakers should lift the current 26-week cap on jobless benefits, he said, and ""states should be required to roll back cuts that have lingered since the end of the last recession.”",Coronavirus drives up unemployment claims ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-drives-up-unemployment-claims-137067,politico
"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened fewer than one million travelers on March 17 — making it the slowest day at airports since the so-called “Snowpocalypse“ in 2011.  According to new data from the TSA, the agency screened 983,226 on Tuesday. That was the fewest daily travelers going through TSA checkpoints since Feb. 1, 2011, when a massive blizzard snarled air traffic across North America. Before Snowpocalypse, the last day when TSA officers screened fewer than a million travelers was May 30, 2004, per the agency’s numbers.  As the U.S. has closed its borders to much of Europe and public health officials have warned people against taking unnecessary flights, year-to-day traveler numbers have plummeted. On March 14, a million fewer people passed through TSA checkpoints than did on the same Saturday in 2019.  TSA officials are at the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The agency has revealed that at least eight of its employees have contracted the virus, which has sickened at least thirteen total Department of Homeland Security officials, per documents POLITICO reviewed. And two sources with knowledge of the situation also said that two contractors from the department’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office have tested positive for the virus. That office plays a role in airport screenings designed to slow the virus’s spread.  The aviation industry has taken a body blow since the coronavirus has spread. The U.S. airline industry’s trade group this week warned carriers were seeing “a dramatic decline in demand, which is getting worse by the day.” The industry implored the federal government to give it loans, grants, and tax relief, saying the economic situation is “simply not sustainable.” The industry group has sought tens of billions in help from Washington, and lawmakers are debating provisions.  President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the industry can expect some sort of bailout.  “Airlines would be No. 1,” he said. “You go from having the best year they have ever had to having no passengers because of what we have had to do to win this war — and it’s a war.”  But any bailout will raise tricky political questions — especially since Trump himself lambasted the Obama administration’s auto industry rescue. And congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have telegraphed that they see any aid package as a chance to call for worker protections and differentiate themselves from Republicans going into the 2020 campaign. Another complicating factor: America’s biggest airlines poured money into buying back their own stock over the past decade. Schumer said on the Senate floor that the companies instead should have saved that money “for a rainy day.”",Airport screenings dip below 1 million per day,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/airport-screenings-dip-below-1-million-per-day-136840,politico
"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  Asha George, the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed to this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Civil War effectively ended at Appomattox, Va. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he declared a national emergency to help combat the pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together,because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command and control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy hospital ships to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to deploy the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a green light for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely because the Comfort is undergoing maintenance that could take weeks. The Mercy, homeported in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with police to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated National Guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients, and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing, “There is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said, “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the respiratory syndrome, which can be deadly. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander in chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Senior Biden aides are clear-eyed about their financial deficit compared to Trump but they insist they’ll have the necessary firepower to combat whatever is coming. At the same time, they’re unconvinced that Trump will refrain from attacks even in the face of a pandemic.  “The American people know who Joe Biden is and what his values are,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. The aides note that Republicans launched ads critical of Biden as early as last fall in early primary states and the former vice president has still emerged the presumptive nominee.  Still, Biden is “definitely getting a break,” said Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Trump wanted to bury Biden after the primary.

"President Donald Trump said he will ""slash red tape like nobody has even done it before"" in a bid to get unapproved coronavirus treatments to patients faster and identify effective drugs. The president said Thursday he directed the Food and Drug Administration to ""eliminate out-of-date rules and bureaucracy so this can go forward fast"" — but he did not offer any details. Instead, Trump and top health officials highlighted steps the government has taken in recent weeks to launch clinical trials of potential coronavirus treatments. Trump's remarks came one day after he teased that an ""exciting FDA announcement"" was on the way — news that reportedly caught some in the health agency by surprise as they scrambled to finalize details, said three HHS officials. The president suggested certain programs that the administration could use to get experimental drugs to people quickly outside of clinical trials. One such route, known as ""Right to Try,"" was established by a 2018 law that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence supported to help people who are seriously ill and have no other treatment options. ""What we're talking about today is beyond Right to Try,"" Trump said, adding that the law ""has been a tremendous success."" That program allows patients to appeal directly to drugmakers to use medicines that are still being developed and tested. Bioethicists and drug policy experts argue there are other ways to help people access experimental medicine — like the FDA’s compassionate use route, also name checked by the president — and that Right to Try fuels false hope, while making it difficult to collect data on how well the drugs work. The drugmaker Gilead has provided its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to patients with coronavirus under compassionate use rules first established in 1987. The National Institutes of Health has also started a clinical trial of the drug in coronavirus patients. Trump name-checked remdesivir at Thursday's briefing, along with two drugs that have been used for decades to treat malaria. He suggested that the malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, could be effective against coronavirus — but the data is still sparse. It is unclear how many people have been treated under the federal Right to Try law for any condition. There are at least nine publicly reported cases. The libertarian Goldwater Institute, which spearheaded efforts to pass the legislation, says at least six of those involved people who received experimental brain cancer vaccine. Goldwater this week pushed for Right to Try to be used amid the coronavirus outbreak. Others are more skeptical about the program's usefulness during the current crisis. ""A lot of these [drug] products are already being deployed through clinical trials as well as compassionate use or emergency use authorities,"" Steve Ubl, CEO of the drug lobby PhRMA, said Wednesday when asked about the Right to Try push. ""I'll leave it at that."" Bioethicists were quick to sound the alarm when Goldwater floated the idea, arguing it would fuel false claims and panic around the outbreak. “Right now, to push the Right to Try pathway seems really irresponsible and dangerous,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a bioethicist at University of Pennsylvania. “This is the type of thing that's critically important to preserve clinical trials for or we’re not going to be able to figure out whether this stuff works.” Trump has urged manufacturers to get treatments and vaccines to patients quickly even as other officials have warned that creating an effective vaccine, in particular, will take at least a year. The FDA this week also let researchers alter clinical trials to keep subjects safe during the outbreak and allow for scientists to assess patients remotely. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" the agency's commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said Thursday. Hahn instead appeared to lean on compassionate use rather than the newer Right to Try law. ""The important thing about compassionate use — and that's what the president meant [with] this is beyond Right to Try — is that we get to collect the information,"" he said. “At this point, the issues that we have been raising with the administration have been focused more on logistics and ensuring that we online to have the free flow of goods to make sure that we can meet patient needs,” PhRMA’s Ubl told reporters Wednesday when asked about the lobby’s goals amid the government’s response.

"Weeks before President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, Sen. Richard Burr privately offered a grim prognosis for the outbreak while previewing some of the massive disruptions soon to come, according to a previously unreported recording obtained by NPR.  In the recording, which NPR reports came from the North Carolina Republican's remarks at a private luncheon late last month, Burr said that the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak ""is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic,"" which killed an estimated 50 million worldwide.  ""There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,"" said Burr, who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr also authored the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the 2006 law that formulated the federal response to outbreaks. In his comments to the Tar Heel Circle in North Carolina on Feb. 27, Burr gave attendees a chilling warning about the severity of the coronavirus at a time when there were only a little over a dozen reported confirmed cases in the U.S. and President Donald Trump was suggesting that number would drop down to zero in short order. But many of Burr’s warnings to the group later came to pass. He instructed attendees to reconsider traveling to Europe, a suggestion that came about two weeks before the president announced a travel ban for foreigners coming to the U.S. from most of Europe. ""You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference. Why risk it?"" he asked the group. The senator also said that the virus could prompt the shuttering of schools, something that happened in his home state a couple of weeks later.  “There will be, I'm sure, times that communities, probably some in North Carolina, have a transmission rate where they say, let's close schools for two weeks, everybody stay home,” he says in the recording. Burr even forecast the mobilization of the military, something that has only begun to happen in recent days on a wider scale. ""We're going to send a military hospital there, it's going to be in tents and going to be set up on the ground somewhere,"" he predicted, noting that ""It's going to be a decision the president and DoD make. And we're going to have medical professionals supplemented by local staff to treat the people that need treatment.”  Burr's tone in private went well beyond an op-ed he co-authored with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), reassuring Americans that although they were rightfully concerned about the outbreak, it was being properly handled by the authorities. ""Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump administration,"" the two senators wrote. ""The work of Congress and the administration has allowed U.S. public health officials to move swiftly and decisively in the last few weeks."" The Trump administration has faced fierce criticism for not taking the outbreak seriously enough at its outset and for fumbling the early testing process — issues the White House is still scrambling to address.

"House Democratic leaders on Thursday announced that lawmakers will not be required to return to Washington until the next stimulus package for the coronavirus pandemic is ready for a vote, part of an attempt to limit exposure to the virus among members of Congress. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer informed members that he will be “adjusting” the House schedule to require less time at the Capitol and halt the virus’ spread among lawmakers — at least two of whom have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. “It is my intention that the House will not return to session until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis,” Hoyer said in a letter to Democrats. Democratic leaders are also looking to reassure members who have grown increasingly anxious about the virus’ spread in the Capitol, and fear the situation could worsen if hundreds of members are forced to be in a single room together. Hoyer confirmed that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point. The Maryland Democrat did not address the possibility of allowing members to vote remotely from their districts, an idea that has steadily gained traction — particularly among West Coast lawmakers — amid the rapidly intensifying outbreak. “I share the concerns of many Members regarding the number of Members on the House Floor at any one time,” Hoyer said. “No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi has privately dismissed the idea of voting outside of the Capitol in past meetings, as have House GOP leaders, though lawmakers and aides have acknowledged that the situation is fluid. Democratic leaders are expected to discuss the idea with their caucus on a conference call Thursday afternoon.  The push to allow remote voting has amplified in the last 12 hours, with two lawmakers — Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) — each testing positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  Nearly two dozen members have decided to self-quarantine after potential exposure to the virus, including several who had close contact with Diaz-Balart and McAdams on the floor or in various gatherings on Friday before the House left for recess. But even before the two lawmakers were diagnosed, there was growing anxiety among House members and staff about the inevitability of the virus spreading on Capitol Hill. Several staffers had already tested positive in both chambers. Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Van Taylor (R-Texas) led a bipartisan letter on Wednesday night calling for remote voting, with signatures from more than 50 members. “When it comes to social distancing and public health best practices, Congress should be an example, not an exception,” Porter wrote on Twitter.",House won't return until stimulus package is ready,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/congress-coronavirus-pandemic-137414,politico
"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the Canada-U.S. border will likely close to nonessential travel on Friday night to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking to reporters from his home in Ottawa this morning, Trudeau said the two governments “are continuing to work on the fine-tuning of the agreement between Canada and the United States,” but said it’s close to being finalized. Trudeau and President Donald Trump both announced Wednesday morning they were working on a mutual agreement to close the border to tourism and recreational travel. The border will stay open to trade, and Trudeau assured Canadians on Wednesday that deliveries of food, fuel and medicine would continue. Still, there remain unanswered questions about what else will be considered essential cross-border travel. The Canada-U.S. agreement will take effect less than 72 hours after Canada closed its borders to most international travelers, other than U.S. citizens. That measure came into effect on Wednesday at noon. Ottawa also says anyone trying to get on a plane to Canada who shows symptoms of the coronavirus will not be allowed to board. On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said all returning snowbirds — Canadians who overwinter in the U.S. — will be able to return to Canada. Canadian citizens who show up at a land border with coronavirus symptoms will be allowed into the country, but will be placed in quarantine.",Trudeau: Canada-U.S. border to close to nonessential travel on Friday night,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/canada-us-border-closing-coronavirus-137433,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged Thursday the U.S. faces months of economic contraction, but predicted a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent up demand” and return to “a normal world.”  In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he believes the economy will see its largest decline in this year’s second quarter, from April through June, followed by a third-quarter recovery as advancements in viral treatments and vaccines eventually halt the spread of the virus.  ""I think you’re going to see a lot of pent-up demand,"" Mnuchin told Maria Bartiromo. ""When we get through the next few months and Americans see what’s happening, and we have killed this virus, people are going to be comfortable going back to work.""  Mnuchin continued: ""We're going to be opening back business and people are going to continue what they do. They are going to live. They are going to shop. They are going to eat out. They are going to enjoy restaurants and travel and entertainment and we will go back to a normal world.”  Bartiromo pressed Mnuchin on company bailouts — a term he continues to push against. He emphasized Thursday that many of these companies will ultimately pay back any loans.  “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need.""  ""In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans. In the case of small businesses, if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them,"" he continued. ""I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.”  Mnuchin also clarified his reported warning to Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could spike to 20 percent if action is not taken. “What I said is that 40 percent of our workforce is in small business,"" he explained. ""And I said, if half of them were let go, mathematically, we’d be at 20 percent unemployment.”  Mnuchin’s upbeat outlook comes alongside grim new data emerging from the federal government. The Labor Department on Thursday reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week, a jump it attributed to the pandemic. It was the highest number of claims since September 2017, and economists expect that figure to soar in the coming weeks. Asked whether economic data should be ignored in this volatile environment, Mnuchin replied, “The statistics in the short run of economics are obviously not relevant. This is an unprecedented situation where, at the government’s direction, we shut down parts of the economy and now is the time that we provide government support.”",Mnuchin predicts ‘gigantic’ fourth quarter after coronavirus rebound,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/steven-mnuchin-predicts-economic-recovery-137214,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday morning, State is expected to issue a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information.  It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later.  ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.”  “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said.  Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens.Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Thousands of U.S. citizens are already stuck in limbo abroad, and the new guidance threatens to create further anxiety and confusion among travelers.  Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. Several current and former U.S. diplomats, some of them with several decades of experience, said they do not recall such a travel advisory ever being issued in the past. The highly unusual guidance is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, following President Donald Trump's move to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have closed their borders and imposed further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned.  “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO.

But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Members of Congress said they’re trying to handle pleas for help from constituents and have been pushing the State Department to figure out how to get Americans home. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from 9 Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help those stuck abroad. “We seek an immediate clarification regarding your current efforts to facilitate the return of Americans to the United States, whether by commercial airline flights, charter flights, or other means,” the letter reads. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner also reached out to Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home.
